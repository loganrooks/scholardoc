Critical philosophical/German terms are garbled. These aren't minor errors - they corrupt key concepts.",

Greek philosophical text ('AYXi~(lahl') shows extreme corruption - this is Heraclitus' Fragment 122, critical to the text. The corruption of this central philosophical reference is a major failure.",

Severe corruption of critical terms: 'autochthonic' (correct), 'bodenstandig' (appears correct), 'eigentlich' (correct), but this is primarily a glossary page with German/English key terms - OCR of German diacritics and special characters likely fails. The very high error rate and unknown_words sample indicate systematic failure on technical German terminology.",
