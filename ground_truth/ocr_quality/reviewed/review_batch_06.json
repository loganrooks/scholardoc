Now, thus understood, the existent is not being (Seiendes)\nin general, but refers to what Heidegger calls Existenz\u2014mainly because it\nhas the same root\u2014that is \u201cthe mode of Being, and precisely, the Being\nof the being which keeps itself open for the aperture of Being, and\nwithin it.\u201d \u201cWas bedeutet \u2018Existenz\u2019 in Sein und Zeit?

Before the analysis of the Irma dream, Freud engages in\nconsiderations of method. In one of his familiar gestures, he opposes\nthe old popular tradition to so-called scienti\ufb01c psychology. As always,\nit is in order to justify the profound intention which inspires the\nformer. Popular tradition may err, of course, when according to a\n\u201csymbolical\u201d procedure, it treats dream content as an indivisible and\nunarticulated whole, for which a second, possibly prophetic whole\nmay be substituted. But Freud is not far from accepting the \u201cother\npopular method\u201d: \u201cIt might be described as the \u2018decoding\u2019 method\n(Chi\ufb00riermethode), since it treats dreams as a kind of cryptography\n(Geheimschrift) in which each sign can be translated into another sign\nhaving a known meaning, in accordance with a \ufb01xed key (Schl\u00fcssel)\u201d (IV,\n97). Let us retain the allusion to a permanent code: it is the weakness of\na method to which Freud attributes, nevertheless, the merit of being\nanalytic and of spelling out the elements of meaning one by one.\nA strange example, the one chosen by Freud to illustrate this trad-\nitional procedure: a text of phonetic writing is cathected and functions\nas a discrete, speci\ufb01c, translatable and unprivileged element in the\noverall writing of the dream. Phonetic writing as writing within writ-\ning. Assume, for example, says Freud, that I have dreamed of a letter\n(Brief / epistola), then of a burial. Open a Traumbuch, a book in which the\nkeys to dreams are recorded, an encyclopedia of dream signs, the\ndream dictionary which Freud will soon reject. It teaches us that letter\nmust be translated (\u00fcbersetzen) by spite, and burial by engagement to be\nmarried. Thus a letter (epistola) written with letters (litterae), a document\ncomposed of phonetic signs, the transcription of verbal discourse, may\nbe translated by a nonverbal signi\ufb01er"

That science is Traumdeutung, also\nknown as oneirocriticism. When all is said and done, it was only a\nscience of writing in priestly hands. God, the Egyptians believed, had\nmade man a gift of writing just as he inspired dreams. Interpreters, like\ndreams themselves, then had only to draw upon the curiological or\ntropological storehouse. They would readily \ufb01nd there the key to\ndreams, which they would then pretend to divine. The hieroglyphic\ncode itself served as a Traumbuch. An alleged gift of God, in fact con-\nstructed historically, it had become the common source from which\nwas drawn oneiric discourse: the setting and the text of the dream\u2019s\nmise en sc\u00e8ne. Since dreams are constructed like a form of writing, the\nkinds of transposition in dreams correspond to condensations and\ndisplacements already performed and enregistered in the system of\nhieroglyphics.

After desiring to restore the properly ontological intention dormant\nwithin metaphysics, after having reawakened the \u201cfundamental ontol-\nogy\u201d beneath \u201cmetaphysical ontology,\u201d Heidegger, faced by the ten-\nacity of traditional ambiguity, \ufb01nally proposes to abandon the terms\n\u201contology\u201d and \u201contological\u201d (Introduction to Metaphysics). The ques-\ntion of Being cannot be submitted to an ontology.\n4. That is, to relativism: the truth of philosophy does not depend upon its\nrelation to the actuality of the Greek or European event. On the con-\ntrary, we must gain access to the Greek or European eidos through an\nirruption or a call whose point of departure is variously determined by\nHusserl and Heidegger. It remains that, for both, \u201cthe irruption of\nphilosophy\u201d (\u201cAufbruch oder Einbruch der Philosophie,\u201d Husserl, Kri-\nsis . . .) is the \u201coriginal\u201d phenomenon which characterizes Europe as a\n\u201cspiritual \ufb01gure\u201d (ibid.). For both, the \u201cword philosophia tells us that\nphilosophy is something which, \ufb01rst of all, determines the existence of\nthe Greek world. Not only that\u2014philosophia also determines the\ninnermost basic feature of our Western-European history, the often\nheard expression \u2018Western-European philosophy\u2019 is, in truth, a tautol-\nogy. Why? Because philosophy is Greek in its nature; Greek, in this\ninstance, means that in origin the nature of philosophy is of such a\nkind that it \ufb01rst appropriated the Greek world, and only it, in order to\nunfold.\u201d Heidegger, What Is Philosophy?, trans.

Ideas, sec. 47, and\nCartesian Meditations, sec. 37) which had already appeared in the\nLogische Untersuchungen, and the concept of an organized totality,\nthe uni\ufb01ed plurality, already present in Philosophie der Arithmetik\n(1887\u201391). Concerning all these questions we refer to A. Gurwitsch\u2019s\nimportant work Th\u00e9orie du champ de la conscience.\n19.

Dorian\nCairns [The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1960], see. 33, p. 68).\n21. \u201cNow, however, we must call attention to a great gap in our exposition.\nThe ego is himself existent for himself in continuous evidence; thus, in\nhimself, he is continuously constituting himself as existing.
