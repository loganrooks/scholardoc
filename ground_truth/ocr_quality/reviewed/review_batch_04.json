But things get complicated, in Bodin as well \nas in Hobbes, and we shall have more than one sign of this: in any case \nin Hobbes, as that\u2019s where we are, it gets complicated by the fact that this \nhumanity, this anthropological essence of prosthstatics is produced, from \nthe opening pages of Leviathan, on the divine model. The arti\ufb01 cial man, \nas Hobbes says, the arti\ufb01 cial soul, the \u201cArti\ufb01 cial Animal\u201d that the Levia-\nthan is, imitates the natural art of God: \u201cnature (the Art whereby God hath \nmade and governes the World) is by the Art of man, as in many other things, \nso in this also imitated, that it can make an Arti\ufb01 cial Animal\u201d (p. 9). These \nare the opening words of Leviathan, we already read them, and the conse-\nquences can be seen constantly and everywhere. And this human mimesis \nproduces automats, machines that mimic the natural life created by God. \nThe life of these automats, of these machines, is compared to that of clocks \nand watches. Why could we not say, Hobbes asks immediately afterward, \nthat all the automata (machines or engines that move by virtue of springs \nand wheels, like a watch) have an arti\ufb01 cial life? In this way, a philosophy \nand even a theology of mimesis grounds in the last analysis the most hu-\nmanist and anthropologist discourse of sovereignty. So that, however dif-\n\ufb01 cult it remains, we must ceaselessly understand how the so- called modern \nhumanist or anthropologist insistence on the speci\ufb01 city of the state or of \nso- called modern political sovereignty gets its irreducible originality, i.e. \nits arti\ufb01 cial, conventional, if you will  techno- prosthstatic nature, only by \ngrounding itself in a profound ontotheology, or even in a religion.

Is stu-\npidity b\u00ea tise? Is it exactly the same thing? We are coming to this.\nTo get back to Deleuze, only the experience of freedom that b\u00ea tise is, as \nhuman freedom, only this freedom as relation to the groundless ground, \ncan explain not only how b\u00ea tise can be foreign to \u201canimals,\u201d but how it can \nbe linked to those three motifs I pointed out a moment ago, namely sover-\neignty, cruelty (and therefore evil \u2014 and illness, Schelling would say), and \n\ufb01 nally thought.\n1. Sovereignty in the \ufb01 gure of the tyrant \ufb01 rst. Deleuze notes that\nthe tyrant has the head not only of an ox, but of a pear, a cabbage, or a po-\ntato. No one is ever superior or exterior to what he pro\ufb01 ts from: the tyrant \ninstitutionalizes b\u00ea tise, but he is the \ufb01 rst servant of his system and the \ufb01 rst \nto be instituted, always a slave commanding slaves.27 [A literally Platonic \nmotif.]28\n2. <Next,> Deleuze is particularly eloquent and insistent on evil and cru-\nelty and their essential link with b\u00ea tise. This is consistent with the gesture \nthat makes of b\u00ea tise the phenomenon of freedom as human freedom. What \nis remarkable is that the distinction between b\u00ea tise and error remains the es-\nsential condition of this whole interpretation and problematic. For Deleuze \nwrites:\n24.
