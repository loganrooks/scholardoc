The 'gibberish' (mecm, pebo, detporpaak, etc.) is actually proper Cyrillic characters that appear foreign when viewed through English OCR standards. The English caption 'Facsimile of the title page of the first edition, published in Petrograd, 1918' is clearly readable. The OCR correctly preserved the multilingual content. This should be classified as GOOD - the OCR did exactly what it should by preserving the original Cyrillic text.",

The OCR quality is actually GOOD - it correctly preserved multilingual content and proper names. The error detection algorithm needs calibration to distinguish between foreign languages/proper nouns and actual OCR corruption."
