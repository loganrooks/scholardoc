Let us not misuse them. Peasant and artisanal \nflideology\" in painting, concern for truth in painting (\"But truth \nis so dear to me, and so is the seeking to make true, that indeed \nI believe, I believe I would still rather be a cobbler than a musician \nwith colors\"), that is what he shares with Heidegger, even if his \n\"truth,\" at least in his discourse, remains representational. Let \nus not abuse this argument, but let us recognize that Heidegger's \nhallucinatory projection, if there is one, is motivated by this iden\u00ad\ntificatory support. One must, of course, explain why Heidegger \nneeded to choose a particular type of object (a product said to be \nfluseful\" as a garment, and this particular garment), a particular \ntype of picture, this particular painter, in order to say what he \nintended to. He couldn't have said the same thing just as easily \nwith other objects, with other painters, with other shoes, those \nof Van Eyck, Miro, Magritte, or Adami. Of course you have to \nanalyze the choice, and the limits, of the exemplary model for \nsuch a discourse on The Origin of the Work of Art. And you have \nto ask analogous questions about Heidegger's poetic models. But \nstill what remains is that the risks of projection were more lim\u00ad\nited. The flprojection\" is at work in the choice of the model rather \nthan in the analysis of it, once the exemplary corpus is that of \nVan Gogh. A certain analogy between Heidegger and Van Gogh, \nwhatever its limits from other points of view, a certain com\u00ad\nmunity of flpathos\" paradoxically provided a support for identi\u00ad\nfication which reduced by so much the risks of flprojection,\" of \nhallucinatory delirium. The \"pathetic\" paragraph on the silent \ncall of the earth is consonant, in another correspondence, with \nthis or that letter of Van Gogh. \n- I should like to go further."
