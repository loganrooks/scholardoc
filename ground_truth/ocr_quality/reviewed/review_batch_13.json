Cabinet ministers \nand professional parliamentarians, the traitors to the proletariat \nand the \u2018businesslike\u2019 socialists of our day have left all criticism of \nparliamentarianism completely to the anarchists, and this wonder\u00ad\nfully rational foundation is used by them to denounce all criticism \nof parliamentarianism as \u2018anarchism\u2019!! It is not surprising that the \nproletariat of the \u2018advanced\u2019 parliamentary countries, feeling a great \ndisgust with \u2018socialists\u2019 such as the Scheidemanns, Davids, Legiens, \nSembats, Renaudels, Hendersons, Vanderveldes, Staunings, Brant- \nings, Bissolatis and Co., has ever more frequently been transferring \nits sympathies to anarcho-syndicalism, despite the fact that the \nlatter is the twin brother of opportunism.\nFor Marx, however, revolutionary dialectics were never the \nempty fashionable phrase, the toy rattle, which Plekhanov, Kautsky \nand others have made of it. Marx knew how to break mercilessly \nwith anarchism for its inability to use even the \u2018pig-sty\u2019 of bourgeois \nparliamentarianism especially when there is quite obviously no \nrevolutionary situation in sight; but at"

Meanwhile it is inside the chancelleries and general \nstaffs that they \u2018work\u2019 on the business of \u2018state\u2019.\nDelo Naroda, the organ of the ruling \u2018Socialist Revolutionary\u2019 \nParty, recently admitted in an editorial article - with the matchless \ncandour of people of the kind of \u2018good society\u2019 where everyone is \nengaged in political prostitution - that even in those ministries \nbelonging to the \u2018socialists\u2019 (please excuse the expression!) the whole \nbureaucratic apparatus has stayed essentially as of old, is function\u00ad\ning in the old way and quite \u2018freely\u2019 sabotaging the revolutionary \nreforms! Even without this admission, does not the actual history \nof the participation of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks \nin the government prove this? Here it is itself a characteristic fact \nthat, in the ministerial company of the Kadets, Messrs Chernov, \nRusanov, Zenzinov and the other editors of Delo Naroda have so \nmuch lost any sense of shame that they make no effort to keep it \nquiet - as if they were talking of a trifle - that in \u2018their\u2019 ministries \neverything has stayed as of old!! Revolutionary-democratic phrases \nto make fools of village simpletons; bureaucracy and red tape to \n\u2018warm the hearts\u2019 of the capitalists: this is the essence of the \u2018honest\u2019 \ncoalition for you.\nThe Commune replaces the venal and rotten parliamentarianism \nof bourgeois society with institutions in which freedom of opinion \nand discussion do not degenerate into deception, for the parliamen\u00ad\ntarians themselves have to work, have to execute their own laws, \nhave to test their results in real life and to answer directly to their \nelectors. Representative institutions remain, but parliamentarianism \ndoes not exist here as a special system, as the division of labour \nbetween the legislative and the executive, as a privileged position \nfor the deputies. We cannot imagine democracy, even proletarian \ndemocracy, without representative institutions, "
