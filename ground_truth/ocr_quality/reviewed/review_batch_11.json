Therefore Leibniz designates these points vis \np1\u00b7imitiva, force primitit\u2022e, primordially simple force. \n(J) This conception of the monad has metaphysical-ontological intent. \nThus Leibniz also calls the points points metaphysiques, \"metaphysical \npoints,\" and not mathematical points (G. rv, 48z; E. 1 26). z They are further \ncalled \"formal atoms,\" not material atoms.

II, z6z). \nUnderstanding the metaphysical meaning of the doctrine of monads \ndepends on correctly understanding the concept of vis primitiva. \nThe problem of the substantiality of substance should be solved posi\u00ad\ntively, and for Leibniz this problem is a problem of unity, of the monad. \nEverything said about force and its metaphysical function must be under\u00ad\nstood from the perspective of the problem of defining the unity of substance \nin a positive way. The nature of force must be understood by way of the \nproblem of unity as it is inherent in substantiality. Leibniz delineates his \nconcept of force, of vis activa, against the Scholastic [37 5] conception of \npotentia activo [active power].

In the Monadolog;y (\u00a7IS) \nhe adds the explanation for this designation: \"car elles ant en elles une \ncenaine perfection (lxo\u2022JaL 'to \u00a3v't\u00a3AEc;)\": for they have in them a certain \nperfection, in a certain manner they carry within them a completeness, \ninsofar as each monad (as will be shown later) brings its positive content \nalready with it, and brings it in such a way that this content is potentially \nthe universe itself. \nThis construal of \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La does not conform to Aristode's real inten\u00ad\ntion. On the other hand, by giving it new meaning, Leibniz claims this very \nterm for his monadology. \nAlready in the Renaissance \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La was translated in the Leibnizian \nsense with peifectibabia; the Monadology, in \u00a748, names Hermolaus Barbarus \nthe translator of the term. In the Renaissance, Hermolaus Barbarus trans\u00ad\nlated and commented on Aristode and on the commentary of Themistius \n(pcr-390), and he did so in order to restore the Greek Aristode against me\u00ad\ndieval Scholasticism. Naturally his task harbored considerable difficulties. \nThe story goes that, compelled by his perplexity over the philosophical \nmeaning of the term tv\"t\u00a3AtX\u00a3La, he invoked the Devil to provide him with \ninstruction. \nAt this point we have explained, in general, the concept of vis activo: \n(I) vis activo means \"drive.\" ( 2) This drive is supposed to be inherent in every \nsubstance as substance.

The monad relates to a resistance, to something it \nis not but could well be. Drive is indeed active, yet in every finite drive \noccurring in a particular [395] perspective, there is always and necessarily \nsomething resistant, something that opposes the drive as such. For insofar \nas it is driving from a particular viewpoint toward the whole universe in \neach case, there are many things that the drive is not. The drive is modified \nby the viewpoint.

Rather the correspondence \nworks in crisscross fashion. Corresponding to the opOA. what is correct \nand its correcmess, there is correct apprehension, and corresponding to \nwhat is beautiful there is the unhidden; for the essence of the beautiful lies \nin being \u20acx?avtot:xtov (cf. Phaedrus), that which, as most of all and most \npurely shining of and from itself, shows the visible form and thus is un\u00ad\nbidden. Both sentences [ 1 38] speak of the primacy of the idea of the good \nas enabling both the correcmess of knowing and the unhiddenness of the \nknown. Here truth still is, at one and the same time, unhiddenness and \ncorrecmess, although unhiddenness already stands under the yoke of the \n(8ta. The same ambiguity in the detennination of the essence of truth still \nprevails in Aristotle as well. In the closing chapter of Book IX of the Meta\u00ad\nphysics (Metaphysics f-), 10, 1051 a34ff.) where Aristotelian thinking on the \nbeing of beings reaches its peak, unhiddenness is the all-controlling fun\u00ad\ndamental trait of beings.

The assertion is called \ntrue insofar as it conforms to the state of affairs and thus is a Oflolwo2c;. \nThis determination of the essence of truth no longer contains an appeal to \naA.f,OE2a in the sense of unhiddenness; on the contrary a/.\u000f0\u00a3\u001fa, now taken \nas the opposite of 4\u00a3\u2022)8oc; (i.e., of the false in the sense of the incorrect), is \nthought of as correcmess.
