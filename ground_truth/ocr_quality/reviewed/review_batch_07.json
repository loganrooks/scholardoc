To avoid \ngetting bewildered, we shall always use the Interpretative expression \n\"presence-at-hand\" for the term \"existentia\", while the term \"existence\", as \na designation of Being, will be allotted solely to Dasein. \nThe essence of Dasein lies in its existence.

Dasein is an entity which, in its \nvery Being, comports itself understandingly towards that Being. In saying \nthis, we are calling attention to the formal concept of existence. Dasein exists. \nFurthermore, Dasein is an entity which in each case I myself am.

In each case Dasein exists in \none or the other of these two modes, or else it is modally undifferentiated.1 \nBut these are both ways in which Dasein's Being takes on a definite \ncharacter, and they must be seen and understood a priori as grounded \nupon that state of Being which we have called \"Being-in-the-world'. An \ninterpretation of this constitutive state is needed if we are to set up our \nanalytic of Dasein correctly. \nThe compound expression 'Being-in-the-world' indicates in the very way \nwe have coined it, that it stands for a unitary phenomenon.
