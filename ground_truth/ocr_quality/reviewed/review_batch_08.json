We avail ourselves of it 'at any time' without \nhaving taken it over explicitly, and we constantly make use of it even \nthough we do not always make utterances about it. Even in the most \ntrivial, offhand kind of everyday talk ('It's cold', for instance) we also \nhave in mind a 'now that . .  .'. Why is it that when Dasein addresses \nitself to the objects of its concern, it also expresses a 'now that . .  .', a \n'then, when \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ', or an 'on that former occasion, when . . .  \n', even though \nit does so mostly without uttering it ? First, because in addressing itself to \nsomething interpretatively, it expresses itself too; that is to say, it expresses \n408 \nits Being alongside the ready-to-band-a Being which understands circum\u00ad\nspectively and which uncovers the ready-to-hand and lets it be en\u00ad\ncountered. And secondly, because this very addressing and discussing\u00ad\nwhich interprets itself also-is based upon a making-present and is possible \nonly as such.t \nThe making-present which awaits and retains, interprets itself. And this \nin turn is possible only because, as something which in itself is ecstatically \nopen, it has in each case been disclosed to itself already and can be \nArticulated in the kind of interpretation which is accompanied by under\u00ad\nstanding and discourse. Because temporality is ecstatico-horizonally constitutive \nfor the clearedness of the \"there\", temporality is always primordially interpretable \nin the \"there\" and is accordingly familiar to us. The making-present which \ninterprets itself-in other words, that which has been interpreted and is \naddressed in the 'now'-is what we call 'time'. This simply makes known \nto us that temporality-which, as ecstatically open, is recognizable-is \nfamiliar, proximally and for the most part, only as interpreted in this \nconcernful manner.1 But while time is 'immediately' intelligible and \nr"

' lies the ecstatical character \nof the Present. The datability of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that \nformer occasion', reflects the ecstatical constitution of temporality, and is \ntherefore essential for the time itself that has been expressed. The structure \nof the datability of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former occasion', \nis evidence that these, stemming from temporality, are themselves time. The \ninterpretative expressing of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former \noccasion', is the most primordial way of assigning a time. 2 In the ecstatical \nunity of temporality-which gets understood along with datability, but \nunthematically and without being recognizable as such-Dasein has \nalready been disclosed to itself as Being-in-the-world, and entities within\u00ad\nthe-world have been discovered along with it; because of this, interpreted \ntime has already been given a dating in terms of those entities which are \nencountered in the disclosedness of the \"there\" : \"now that-the door \nslams\" ; \"now that-my book is missing\", and so forth. 3 \nThe horizons which belong to the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that \nformer occasion', all have their source of ecstatical temporality; by reason \nof this, these horizons too have the character of datability as 'today, \n409 \nwhen . .  .', 'later on, when . . .  ', and 'earlier, when . .  .'' \nIf awaiting understands itself in the 'then' and interprets itself, and \nthereby, as making present, understands that which it awaits, and under\u00ad\nstands this in terms of its 'now', then the 'and-now-not-yet' is already \nimplied when we 'assign' a 'then'. The awaiting which makes present \nunderstands the 'until-then'.

That which gets \ncounted when one measures time concernfully, the \"now\", gets co-under-\nstood in one's concern with the present-at-hand and the ready-to-hand. \nNow so far as this concern with time comes back to the time itself which \nhas been co-understood, and in so far as it 'considers' that time, it sees the \n\"nows\" (which indeed are also somehow 'there') within the horizon of that \nunderstanding-of-Being by which this concern is itself constantly guided.1x \n42 3 \nThus the \"nows\" are in a certain manner co-present-at-hand: that is, entities \nare encountered, and so too is the \"now\". Although it is not said explicitly \nthat the \"nows\" are present-at-hand in the same way as Things, they still \nget 'seen' ontologically within the horizon of the idea of presence-at-hand. \nThe \"nows\" pass away, and those which have passed away make up the \npast. The \"nows\" come along, and those which are coming along define the \n'future'. The ordinary interpretation of world-time as now-time never \navails itself of the horizon by which such things as world, significance, \nand datability can be made accessible. These structures necessarily remain \ncovered up, all the more so because this covering-up is reinforced by the \nway in which the ordinary interpretation develops its characterization of \ntime conceptually. \nThe sequence of \"nows\" is taken as something that is somehow present\u00ad\nat-hand, for it even moves ' i nto time'.1 We say : 'In every \"now\" is now; \nin every \"now\" it is already vanishing.' In every \"now\" the \"now\" is now \nand therefore it constantly has presence as something selfsame, even though \nin every \"now\" another may be vanishing as it comes along.11 Yet as this \nthing which changes, it simultaneously shows its own constant presence.

In this lostness, however, Dasein's fleeing in the face of \nthat authentic existence which has been characterized as \"anticipatory \nresoluteness\", has made itself known ; and this is a fleeing which covers up. \nIn this concernful fleeing lies a fleeing in the face of death-that is, a \nlooking-away from the end of Being-in-the-world.xU This looking-away \nfrom it, is in itself a mode of that Being-towardr-the-end which is ecstatically \nfutural.
