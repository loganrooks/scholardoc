      "rationale": "Most 'unknown words' are legitimate philosophical terms: 'aeternitatis' (Latin: 'sub specie aeternitatis' is a standard philosophical phrase meaning 'from the perspective of eternity'). 'Theoretism', 'objectivism', 'premetaphysical' are valid philosophical neologisms. The fragment 'munion' could be from 'communion' (visible in text). The text is philosophically dense but readable and coherent. Character-level ligatures (U+FB01) are standard in scholarly PDFs, not OCR errors.",

The OCR correctly preserved the German quote. The complaint that German words are 'unknown' is a vocabulary issue, not an OCR quality issue. This is a multilingual scholarly text; foreign language terms should not be classified as OCR errors.",

Primary cause: multilingual scholarly text (English/French/German/Latin) with legitimate foreign language terms, philosophical neologisms, and standard bibliographic conventions being flagged as 'unknown words' or OCR errors. Pages 136, 421-422, 426, 430-431, 433-434, 438, 441, 443 show this pattern clearly. Confirmed BAD pages (285-286, 317, 347, 404, 406, 409-410, 468-470) show genuine OCR degradation including: corrupted diacritics, word fragmentation, truncated proper names, and character encoding failures - particularly problematic in bibliographic sections where citation accuracy is critical."
