'Colours' is the British spelling (text is translated by British translator). The text is philosophical/technical with German terms intentionally preserved - this is expected for Kant scholarship. No actual garbled text in main body. The 'divisi-' is just a hyphenated line break for 'divisible'.",

'Zeichnung' (design), 'Composition', 'innerlich' are all correct German terms being discussed. The philosophical terms 'parerga', 'parergon', 'ergon' are Greek terms central to Derrida's argument.
