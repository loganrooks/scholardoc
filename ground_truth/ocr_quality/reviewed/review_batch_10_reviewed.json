Page 10 contains critical errors: 'Reidegger' appears TWICE (lines referencing the philosopher's name), which is a severe error given this is a book BY Heidegger. The author's name being consistently misspelled is unacceptable for scholarly text. Additionally, the truncated sentence 'they can do thi' at the end confirms word-breaking issues. These are genuine OCR failures, not German terminology.",

Page 18 contains severe errors: 'oomplex' (should be 'complex'), 'regioning' appears to be correct in the visible text, but the truncated sentence ending 'receives the disclos' confirms systematic issues. The claim about 'ldentitiit' and 'differenz' cannot be verified in the visible portion, but the character substitution 'oomplex' (o instead of c) and sentence truncation are real failures.

      "rationale": "MAJOR FALSE POSITIVE. The visible text shows NO errors. The Greek text 'AYXt~(lahl' is attempting to render 'ἀγχιβασίη' (Heraclitus Fragment 122) which IS legitimately difficult for OCR. However, looking at the actual extracted text: 'AYXt~(laLrt' appears later with different characters, suggesting OCR is struggling with Greek. BUT the English text appears clean: 'going toward', 'modern scientific', 'counter-movement', 'moving-into-n' (truncated at page boundary). The claimed errors 'narve', 'owar', 'lalrt', 'ayxt', 'thmk', 'yxt' do NOT appear in the extracted text. This appears to be a classification error based on Greek character rendering, which is expected behavior for ancient Greek in a philosophy text.",

The 17.2% error rate claim is completely wrong - these are NOT errors, they are legitimate German philosophical vocabulary that SHOULD be in the text. This is the kind of specialized terminology that makes Heidegger difficult but is essential to preserve. Zero actual errors detected.",

Pages 47-48 are glossary pages with PERFECT OCR of German terms - they were wrongly flagged because the classifier didn't recognize technical vocabulary. Pages 10 and 18 have real errors (misspelled author name, character corruption). Page 46 is borderline - Greek rendering issues are expected, but English text is clean."
