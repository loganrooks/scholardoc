Never could I have imag-\nined such acute, thoughtful, and generous readers. I am profoundly grateful \nfor the probing comments, friendship, and inspiring examples of Ian \u00adBalfour, \nAndrew Cutrofello, Daniel Heller-Roazen, Lyndal Roper, and Nick \u00adStargardt, \nwho all read the manuscript at various stages. I owe particular thanks to Ma-\nrina Vitkin, who commented on the manuscript repeatedly with her inimi-\ntable rigor and subtlety, and to Jay Bernstein, for penetrating comments and \nalways bracing discussion. Above all I thank Cary Fagan, for unforgettable \nconversations, writerly acuity, and for help in every way and every day.\nMany of these ideas were first explored in the classroom, and I thank my \namazing students in Toronto, Buffalo, and Princeton who inspired me hugely. \nPortions of the writing were done while holding visiting appointments in \nthe Comparative Literature Department at the University of Buffalo and the \nGerman Department at Princeton, where I also had the good fortune to be a \nvisiting fellow in the Humanities Council; I am particularly grateful for the \nhospitality of Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9, Shaun Irlam, and Susan Varney while I was \nat Buffalo, and Mike Jennings, Eduardo Cadava and Tori McGeer at Prince\u00ad\nton. And I am deeply appreciative of the ongoing support of my colleagues at \nthe University of Toronto\u2014in particular Eric Cazdyn, Julian \u00adPatrick, Donald \nAinslie, and Bob Gibbs. The editorial team at Stanford University Press made \nthe publication process as blissfully efficient as the writing process was not, \nand I am especially grateful to my editors, Emily-Jane Cohen and Mariana \nRaykov, and to Peter Dreyer for his meticulous copyediting. Thanks also to \nKarin Nisenbaum for her careful work preparing the index, and to Emilio \nComay del Junco for help preparing the final manuscript. \nBut this owes most of all to the generosity and exuberance of those \nwho lived with it\u2014above all to Emilio and Yoyo, who were there from the \nvery beginning (this is for you, to remember the times in Berlin and Paris, \nand for all the other times too), and to Cary, Sophie, and Rachel, who came \nalong in the middle and transformed my life.\n"

Gazing across the Rhine at the chaos and carnage, Ger-\nman philosophy congratulates itself for having preempted such turmoil on \nits own soil. Germany doesn\u2019t need that kind of revolution: it has already \nexperienced a far more shattering one of its own. Having long established \nits own brand of radicalism in the form of the Protestant Reformation, \nGermany has already outstripped, at a spiritual level, anything the French \ncould accomplish in practical terms.\nHaving successfully gone through its own upheaval, Germany recog-\nnizes its own image in the French revolutionary struggle and is poised to \nextract from the Revolution an energy blocked to those caught up in its \nwhirl. This affinity allows it to affirm solidarity with the Revolution and \neven to enjoy a vicarious thrill in its terrors, while managing to soften its \nultimate impact. Germany lays claim to the revolutionary legacy even as \nit denies any immediate link to the event. By insisting on its own radical \npedigree, it is able to position itself as the French Revolution\u2019s predecessor, \nsuccessor, and most faithful contemporary.

Mis\u00e8re (the word, with its majuscule, \nis strictly speaking neither French nor German) stands here above all for \na historical discordance. The Revolution not only highlights the startling \ncontrast between the breathtaking modernity of France and the general de-\ncrepitude of a Germany still mired in the swamplands of feudal absolut-\nism\u2014the various political, social, economic, and technological delays that \nseem to consign it to the backwaters of history\u2014\u201ca dusty fact in the his-\ntorical lumber-room of modern nations.\u201d1 It also throws into relief a persis-\ntent misalignment both between and within the various strands of German \nexperience\u2014a blend of intellectual precocity and political retardation that \nsets the pace for its peculiar transition to modernity. \u201cWe are the philosophi-\ncal contemporaries of the modern age without being its historical contem-\nporaries,\u201d Marx comments.2 This discrepancy between theoretical audacity \nand practical docility\u2014intense philosophical intimacy with an event that is \nregarded as either politically repugnant or pragmatically unthinkable\u2014re-\nveals far more than ambivalence, inconsistency, hypocrisy, or the regression \nof German culture from the lofty heights of speculation into \u201cbeer-\u00adswilling \nphilistinism.\u201d3 (This last insult was recurrent in the radical literature of \nthe 1840s, as the forces of repression and censorship swelled, revolutionary \nhopes sagged, and the cosmopolitan ambitions of German idealism gave \nway to virulent forms of nationalism and parochial self-\u00adinterest. \u201cA Ger-\nman\u2019s patriotism,\u201d writes Heine, \u201cmeans that his heart contracts and shrinks \nlike leather in the cold.\u201d)4 The discrepancy points to a seemingly incorri-\ngible temporal slippage. German history scans as a dissonant counter\u00adpoint \nof divergent rhythms running along separate tracks, each set to a different \ntempo and a different beat. Racing forever ahead of an event to which it \ncan never catch up, forever Achilles to the tortoise, Germany, around 1800, \npresents the perfect model of historical nonsynchronicity.\n"

Anach-\nronism is its signature: experience is continually outbidding itself, perpetu-\nally making demands that it (i.e., the world) is unequipped to realize and \nunprepared to recognize, and comprehension inevitably comes too late to \nmake a difference, if only because the stakes have already changed. Abso-\nlute knowing is the exposition of this delay. Its mandate is to make explicit \nthe structural dissonance of experience. If philosophy makes any claim to \nuniversality, this is not because it synchronizes the calendars or provides \nintellectual compensation for its own tardiness. Its contribution is rather \nto formalize the necessity of the delay, together with the inventive strate-\ngies with which such a delay itself is invariably disguised, ignored, glamor-\nized, or rationalized.\nThis is why, for Hegel, the French Revolution will remain a \u201cknot\u201d \n(Philosophy of History)\u2014it leaves a residue for future generations. Although \nmy reading differs from conventional readings that deplore the capacious-\nness of absolute knowing\u2014its ability to absorb and profit from the most \nrecalcitrant material (evil, idiocy, excrement, etc.)\u2014it is not my ambition \nto point to some kind of inassimilable remainder to the system, a moment \nof excess or exteriority to reason. My aim is rather to explore the ways in \nwhich the seeming exception constitutes the norm: revolutionary negativ-\nity is simultaneously a limit to experience and its paradigmatic logic. This \nis why the French Revolution appears at once unbridgeably distant and \nuncannily familiar.\nPhilosophy diagnoses the \u201cGerman misery\u201d even as it inevitably per-\npetuates it. Hegel shares the usual fantasies of his epoch, but adds a dose \nof clarity and critique to the ideological brew. This is what makes him sin-\ngularly interesting among his contemporaries. He shows how a fantasy can \nbe simultaneously enjoyed and deconstructed. In the long-awaited (and \nstrangely anticlimactic) finale of the \u201cSpirit\u201d chapter in the Phenomenol-\nogy\u2014this will be the topic of my final chapter\u2014thinking will be forced to \nconfront the costs of its own lateness.\nHegel\u2019s philosophy thus poses an immediate challenge. How to con-\nceptualize lateness without assuming the stable reference point of a uni-\nform and continuous time frame from which to take the measure of the \ndelay? The issue is normative: can the concept of delay be thought without \nintroducing a linear, additive, progressive\u2014in every way outdated\u2014model \n"

Despite the \nabundance of available German words conveying more or less the same idea \n(\u201cupheaval,\u201d \u201crebellion,\u201d \u201coverthrow,\u201d \u201cinsurrection\u201d), attempts at para-\nphrase kept faltering. \u201cRevolution\u201d was neither eindeutschbar or verdeutsch-\nbar: despite its age, it could not be integrated, and despite its familiarity, it \nyielded no precise synonym.

The specific resistance to the French language \neasily goes back to a reaction against the prestige of French in eighteenth-\u00ad\ncentury German court culture, while a more general antipathy to things \nLatin dates at least from the Reformation. Luther\u2019s translation of the Vul-\ngate had explicitly set out to liberate the living spirit of Scripture from the \ndeadly literalism of the Roman Catholic Church. The very idea of Ger-\nmanness, Deutschheit, was already linked here to the proto-Enlightenment \nideal of clarity and accessibility, Deutlichkeit\u2014a publicity bound to the im-\nmediacy of oral speech and to the open circulation of street and market.3 \nWe might say that Deutschheit supplied the radiant middle term between \nthe luminous poles of religion (Revelation) and reason (Enlightenment).\nBy the time Campe issued his salvo, the revolutionary wars were \nraging, and Germany\u2019s situation was perilous. \u201cGermany is a state no \nmore,\u201d Hegel would announce within a few years, adding that actually, \nstrictly speaking, it never had been a state, not a real one, not a nation \nto live or die for, that it lacked the essential drive to unity, that at least \nsince the Peace of Westphalia, if not before, the German nation had been \nin a condition of \u201corganized statelessness\u201d\u2014a lifeless aggregate, a heap of \nstones\u2014ravaged by its obdurate individualism, political fragmentation, \nand centrifugal tendency to dispersion.4 This had been a common theme \nwell before 1800.

For one rapturous year, he had \nrelayed his impressions in a widely read series of open letters published \nin the liberal Braunschweiger Journal. Campe describes himself repeatedly \nas swimming against the current\u2014pushing against a barrage of warnings \nfrom friends and family and even against his own initial sense of revulsion \nas he forces his way through the dank and depressing outskirts of Paris to-\nward the effervescent city center. He describes the Revolution as an irre-\nsistible flood sweeping aside ossified ideas and structures, and transforming \nFrenchmen overnight into virtuous Greeks and Romans.\nBy 1792, the tide had turned, the roads of Europe were swarming \nwith \u00e9migr\u00e9s, refugees, and soldiers, the flood had begun to erode lin-\nguistic as well as geographical boundaries, and the German language was \nawash with foreign borrowings. Meanwhile, back in Paris, the slaughter \nhad begun, and Campe, like most of his compatriots, had long decamped \nfrom the scene. His manifesto of 1792 is itself a testimony to the irre-\nsistibility of the French attraction, and not simply by virtue of its pas-\nsionate intensity. Wieland remarks on the \u201clinguistic Jacobinism\u201d of the \nproject. The strange rigor of Campe\u2019s proposal derives in large part from \nthe French idea of sovereignty, with its norm of homogeneity, transpar-\nency, and legibility, and exhibits the general ambiguity of German cul-\ntural nationalism around 1800: how to construct an autonomy forged in \nthe image of the oppressor?\nBy 1806, Napoleon\u2019s army would have conquered the territories on \nboth sides of the Rhine, annexed Austria and Prussia, and put an official \nend to the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire and thus to Germany\u2019s \nsymbolic claim, such as it was, to world-historical significance. The stakes \nhad mounted. A year after the battle of Jena, Campe issues a second mani-\nfesto. If the French troops cannot be ejected, the Germans can at least take \na cue from their example; they can turn back the invasion of foreign words \nthat have burrowed through the ramparts of the German language, and \nextract from the restored transparency of their own language a consoling \nimage of national integrity.

The \nGermans have transformed empire: with the sack of Rome, the restless \nGoths brought down the pagan universe, indirectly enabling the ideological \ntransformation to universal Christendom.17 The Germans have laid claim \nto empire: with the pope\u2019s crowning of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus, \non Christmas Day, 800, the torch passed from Byzantium to Franconia, and \nwith the accession of Otto I, in 962, the imperium found its explicit center \nin the Holy Roman Empire (explicitly named, as of 1512, the Holy Roman \nEmpire of the German Nation: Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Na-\ntion).18 And Germany has redefined the terms of empire. While denounc-\ning the legal fiction of translatio imperii, Luther slyly adapts the scheme to \npromote his own vision of Germany\u2019s special world historical mission.

The modernist figure of revolution as unpredictable historical frac-\nture slides into the traditional astronomical figure of revolution as irresist-\nible cyclical recurrence, while this latter figure of circularity in turn shifts \nfrom a consoling image of stability into a mocking image of meaningless-\nness and futility: one more spin of the wheel, a vain overturning awaiting \nits own overturning.

Kant\u2019s arguments against revolution are \nvarious and scattered\u2014none very good\u2014appealing to everything from \npositive law to divine commandment.33 They invoke an ascending series \nof formal tautologies centered on issues of jurisprudence.

Michel Foucault has marked \nthe historical transition from one scopic regime to another\u2014the moment \nwhen the spectacular juridical apparatus of absolute monarchy gave way \nto the disciplinary mechanisms of modern bureaucracy, when sovereign \npower relinquished its need to display itself everywhere, like the sun, and \ninstead learned to operate invisibly, microscopically, anonymously, effi-\nciently, through the diffuse, disenchanted, neutral machinery of surveil-\nlance.57 The elaborate dramaturgy of the public executions (the procession \nof the tumbrel, the approach to the scaffold, the hush of the crowd, the \nmonstration of the severed head) could not quite conceal the fact that \nthe guillotine offered precious little to feed the gaze. Even as the idea \nof decapitation proved endlessly inspiring to the popular visual imagina-\ntion\u2014images of ghostly apparitions, severed heads, and hungry canni-\nbal machines circulated everywhere, in prints and posters, in sideshows \nand phantasmagoria, in puppet shows and magic lanterns, in children\u2019s \ntoys and women\u2019s fashion, in paperweights and kitchen gadgets58\u2014the \ndrabness of the spectacle was becoming depressingly clear to all. Onlook-\ners complained that they could see nothing, that the executioners blocked \nthe view, that it was all over before it began, that there was no time for \nmoral uplift. \u201cThere is no tragedy for them, they don\u2019t have time to be \nmoved,\u201d Restif de la Bretonne commented.59 The prodigious efficiency of \nthe operation simultaneously drew crowds, who came eager to see justice \ndone, the apparatus tested and speed records broken, and provoked an in-\ncreasingly disappointed response. Camille Desmoulins predicted that the \nshow\u2019s success would spell its failure: the better the machine performed, \nthe less it offered. He replied to Marat\u2019s boast that he would, if necessary, \nstrike down five hundred, five thousand, twenty thousand in a heartbeat: \n\u201cMonsieur Marat\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. you are the dramaturge of journalists; the Dana\u00efds, \n"

In the Phe-\nnomenology, Hegel stages this destructive dialectic with some relish as he \nanalyzes the collapse of the feudal order of the ancien regime. This crisis \nis only the most recent and spectacular in a long history of catastrophes, \nbut it makes explicit the contradictions driving Spirit to this point. This is \nwhy the French Revolution will assume pivotal philosophical significance \nfor Hegel. It crystallizes an entire history. It brings European history to a \nhead by exposing the impossible pressure of secularization that has plagued \ncollective existence from the start.\nThe Revolution brings modernity to its turning point by reacti-\nvating the unfinished project of antiquity. It inherits the theological-\u00ad\npolitical crisis of legitimacy that had ruined the illusory tranquility of the \nGreek polis. Hegel\u2019s analysis of Sittlichkeit had shattered every nostalgia \nfor an original transparency and plenitude. The beautiful polis turns out \nto have been a fragile edifice constructed on the hidden fault line between \ntwo irreconcilable orders.

The young Hegel, in Stuttgart and \nT\u00fcbingen, had deliriously engaged such fantasies.10 In Jena he would \nleave them forever wilted. This is why the clash between Antigone and \nCreon is paradigmatic: the spectacle blocks every nostalgia for commu-\nnitarian harmony. The tragedy brings to the surface the explosive antag-\nonism sustaining the political order and reveals its toxic aftermath. The \nrotting corpse of Polyneices will be a permanent reminder of what re-\nmains unburied and unmourned in every struggle for legitimacy.\nThe task of modernity will be to explore this fissure. The rubble of \nSittlichkeit had revealed what all ruins do, namely that the world is con-\nstructed. If the polis looked beautiful, this is because it was already artifice \nand artifact\u2014the product of construction and as such susceptible to un-\nmaking or deconstruction. Modernity begins with this corrosively denat-\nuralizing insight. This is why its setting is the demolition zone left upon \nthe collapse of Greek Sittlichkeit, as the rift became a chasm, the gods fled, \nthe dead sank into oblivion, and the world disintegrated into a heap of \nisolated particles and scattered stage props\u2014\u201ccold, soulless atoms.\u201d The \nonly way of imparting unity to this pulverized universe was through the \nabstract force of a law stripped of all legitimacy (and thus requiring for its \nexecution the military prowess of a ruler whose own authority had been \nreduced to an ostentatious display of destructive, orgiastic excess) (PhG \n\u00a7481).

The achievement of the imperium remains colossal: it makes chill-\ningly explicit the profundity of the disenchantment.\nModernity takes ruination (Verw\u00fcstung) as its foundation (PhG \n\u00a7472). The world in which we find ourselves is a manufactured one, \nbeauty is a masquerade (the Roman citizen is thus a \u201cperson\u201d or persona, \na mask or theatrical impersonation, and the state a spectacular one),12 \nand we must henceforth invent what we discover. This is why the mod-\nern world defines itself explicitly as \u201cculture\u201d (Bildung): it is our way of \nregistering that we place ourselves in a world of our own making (PhG \n\u00a7484).

The utilitarian social contract is therefore designed to \nproduce a maximum of happiness: it tries to give a term or measure to de-\nsire, to prolong pleasure within \u201cnatural\u201d limits, which amounts to reduc-\ning it to the thinnest terms of self-preservation: pleasure can be enhanced \nonly by stretching it out into the empty bad infinite of self-reproduction\u2014\nsheer animal survival. \u201c\u2018Measure\u2019 or proportion has the function of pre-\nventing pleasure in its variety and duration from being cut short; i.e., the \nfunction of \u2018measure\u2019 is immoderation\u201d (PhG \u00a7560). And at this point \nHegel\u2019s narrative takes on an intensity unmatched elsewhere in his writ-\ning. The entire precipitation into terror is contained in reason\u2019s campaign \nagainst a world it can neither accommodate nor quite, in the end, give up.\nOf Kings and Cabbages\nHaving defined itself as negative, reason is set to embark on an an-\nnihilating mission that will culminate in a \u201cfury of destruction.\u201d The re-\ntreat from objectivity escalates as Spirit progressively moves from the \ndemystification, manipulation, and instrumentalization of singular exis-\ntence to its eventual prosecution, and extermination: this is how Hegel \ndescribes the unstoppable movement from insight through utility to the \n"

Hegel is the first to notice the strange \nmixture of thrill and boredom. Repetitive, inexpressive, featureless, the scaf-\nfold becomes at once a setting, a stage prop and the leading player (personi-\nfied invariably as dripping female\u2014Sainte \u00adGuillotine, holy mother, vagina \ndentata, etc.) of a continuous drama in which the pornographic keeps alter-\nnating with the grotesque, the uncanny with the carnivalesque, the maudlin \nwith the magical, the ghoulish with the prosaic, the orgiastic with the dis-\ngusting, and the boring with the even more boring. Boredom is not just the \nantithesis of fascination; Hegel suggests that they are the same.\nHegel\u2019s philosophical exegesis of the guillotine goes beyond Fou-\ncault\u2019s unforgettable description, in Discipline and Punish, of the transi-\ntion from lurid Baroque \u201cfestivals of cruelty\u201d to the numbing efficiency of \nmodern punishment\u2014the shift from the theatrical extravaganzas of pub-\nlic torture to the modern production of the criminal\u2019s body as an undif-\nferentiated instrument on which punishment can be administered within \nthe transparency of a homogeneous penal regime.

He \nis focused on a more intractable antinomy. His target is the paradox of a \nmurder that strips away, not just the life, but the prior subjectivity of the \nvictim. The elimination of face-to-face contact between victim and execu-\ntioner (\u201cthe axe is seen rather than the hand that set it in motion\u201d)36 is one \naspect of this obliteration. The guillotine retroactively retracts the mini-\nmal recognition it concedes its victim (as worthy of suspicion in the first \nplace) in that it directs itself toward an already annihilated nonentity. By \nstripping death of its intensity and singularity it provides a practical dem-\nonstration of the object\u2019s nullity. The guillotine\u2019s essential function is in \nthis sense to render itself inessential or redundant.

The \niteration suggests the multifarious logic of the death drive: every death is a \nsecond death; the dead are never quite dead enough; and even the dead are \nnever safe. The quicklime that swallowed the corpse within the anonym-\nity of the mass grave confirms that we are in the region of what Adorno \ncalls the \u201cphilosopheme of pure identity\u201d\u2014death in its most unsublimated \ninsignificance: modern death.

Hegel backdates the Ter-\nror to the very onset of the revolution: June 17, 1789. This was the day the \n\u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux spontaneously and virtually unanimously recreated itself as \nthe Assembl\u00e9e nationale, sworn to perpetual and uninterrupted convoca-\ntion, sole agent and embodiment of the nation\u2019s will.\nWith the Tennis Court Oath, the ex nihilo transition of the tiers \u00e9tat \nfrom \u201cnothing\u201d to \u201ceverything\u201d was both affirmed and performatively ac-\ncomplished: the oath both marked and made the people\u2019s transition from \npolitical nullity to the \u201ccomplete nation\u201d that it would retroactively deter-\nmine itself to have always already been. Because it defined itself as struc-\nturally complete, the nation had to surgically eliminate what differed from \nit as an excrescence whose very existence was a contradiction. This is why \nthe founding act of revolutionary democracy is the purge. This literaliza-\ntion of Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s\u2019s formula establishes political modernity as a fellowship \nof terror. With this gesture, \u201cthe undivided substance of absolute freedom \nascends to the throne of the world without any power being able to resist \nit\u201d (PhG \u00a7585).\nIn identifying the Terror with the origin of the Revolution, Hegel has \ninevitably been compared to Edmund Burke (whose Reflections on the Rev-\nolution in France had been almost immediately translated, and in Hegel\u2019s \nfavorite journal), to Louis de Bonald and Hippolyte Taine (for whom the \nslide from the Revolution of liberty to the despotism of equality was pre-\ndestined), and even to Joseph de Maistre (for whom the Terror was the \nprovidential punishment for the hubris of human self-assertion). Such \ncomparisons only have a tiny degree of justice, even if Hegel\u2019s inexplicable \nsavagery to Rousseau does nothing to discourage them (for the record, his \nrhetoric does stop short of Burke\u2019s hysterical denunciation of Rousseau as \nan \u201cinsane Socrates\u201d). It is true that Hegel has much to account for, not \nleast his general sourness about the July Revolution of 1830 and his per-\n"

Terror marks \nthe entanglement between modern liberty and the theological residue that \nsustains it. The regicide marks the symbolic inauguration of political mo-\ndernity: it stages the instantaneous and total transfer of sovereignty from \nking to people. The fall of the blade marks the sublime instant separating \n(but in this way also fusing) before and after, ancien r\u00e9gime and revolu-\ntionary republic: \u201cLe roi est mort\u2014vive la patrie.\u201d This sacrificial logic was \n\u00adceremonially enacted on January 21, 1793, in an event marked, according \nto all the narratives, by sacred pomp and ceremony.

He gains his absolute status only \nat the moment of relinquishing it.\nAt the trial, Saint-Just argued that it was ultimately the ideology of \nroyal inviolability that condemned Louis insofar as it explicitly located him \noutside the body politic: he was an ennemi \u00e9tranger\u2014a moral \u201cmonster,\u201d the \nabb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire added.

Although Hegel barely pauses at the regicide, he is the first to identify \nin the negative theology of the guillotine the link between the terrors of \nmodern democracy and the disavowed fundamentalism on which it rests. \nHe is perhaps the first also to make the connection between this disavowal \nand the compulsive construction of fanaticism as the terrifying fundamen-\ntalism of the Other. War on terror is democracy\u2019s way of abjecting what \nremains its own darkest secret to itself. Insight needs faith: modern de-\nmocracy is just the unfolding of their violent symbiosis through the mel-\nancholic staging of an ungrieved loss.\nWhat Claude Lefort calls the \u201cpersistence of the theological-\u00adpolitical\u201d \nmight be understood as a kind of fetishism: the empty place left by the \nevacuation of transcendence is filled by the self-production of the na-\ntion as power incarnate.48 Lack is here simultaneously acknowledged and \ndisavowed: the sacramental substitution of people for king serves to im-\nmediately close the gap the regicide opens up; this perverse substitution \nunderpins every modern politics of fusion.

One might understand this tenacity, a fidelity to absence \nas such, as a kind of mourning.\nHegel goes further: he establishes that the place was actually always \nempty. This is not simply about the reinstatement of absolutism through \nrevolutionary dictatorship. Absolute monarchy was already an \u201cempty \nname,\u201d a heap of ornaments clustering around an empty throne\u2014legit-\nimacy shrinking even as the emblems and props of power multiplied. It \nis this originary vacancy that modernity both covers up and transmits. \nRevolutionary purity brings into view precisely what it most denies: the \nemptiness at the heart of the symbolic order. This loss does not begin \nwith the self-evacuation of absolute monarchy. The voiding of the king\u2019s \nname is just the delayed registration of the ruination into which beautiful \n\u00adSittlichkeit was thrown\u2014\u201cswallowed up in the simple necessity of a blank \ndestiny\u201d (\u00a7477)\u2014and with it every fantasy of communitarian substance. \n"

By the little which now satisfies Spirit, we can measure the extent of \nits loss\u201d (PhG \u00a78).\nMona Ozouf describes Thermidor as a \u201clabor of forgetfulness.\u201d3 Rather \nthan engaging in a mourning work that would inherit, surpass, and trans-\nmit the revolutionary legacy, the Thermidorians sought to normalize the \nevent;\u00a0the Revolution both elided its traumatic memories and suppressed its \nown utopian demands. For Hegel, such a drive to oblivion is structural: it \nexpresses Spirit\u2019s resistance to its own irresistible self-surpassing; political re-\naction is here a variant of a more general conceptual inertia (Tr\u00e4gheit). The \nvarious regressions of the Thermidorian aftermath express the reflexive anxi-\nety unleashed by the Terror\u2014terror\u2019s own terror of itself, its logical inability \nto sustain itself, and the repeated short-\u00adcircuiting of the Revolution to prer-\nevolutionary positions.\nThis Sisyphean cycle echoes the comedy of forgetfulness that had in-\naugurated the epic theater of Spirit. The famous opening act of the Phe-\nnomenology features the burlesque of a subject mulishly clinging to its \nabstractions, in this case the belief in raw, unmediated sensory experience, \nas it lurches about ineffectually, brandishing its monosyllables (\u201cThis!\u201d \n\u201cHere!\u201d \u201cNow!\u201d) like talismans designed to ward off the irredeemable neg-\nativity at its core. Unprepared to recognize the truth of its own words, the \nsubject is like a student forever writing his lines in disappearing ink. \u201c[I]t is \nalways reaching this result, learning from experience what is true in it; but \nequally it is always forgetting it and starting the movement all over again\u201d \n(PhG \u00a7109). Beneath the slapstick Hegel discerns the thinly veiled melan-\ncholy of a subject dumbstruck by its narcissistic wounds; the loss of one\u2019s \nmost cherished convictions turns every \u201cpathway of doubt\u201d (Zweifel ) into \na \u201cpathway of despair\u201d (Verzweiflung) (PhG \u00a778). The despair is constitu-\ntive. It arises from the internal splitting or duplicity (Zweifalt) defining \nconsciousness as such. Condemned to strike postures it cannot sustain, to \nmeasure itself against standards to which it cannot adhere and that do not \nthemselves cohere, consciousness is inherently torn or \u201ctwofold\u201d\u2014doubt-\nful, desperate, and despairing. Since it defines itself by its own cognitive \ncommitments, it necessarily experiences every loss of certainty as \u201cthe loss \n"

He points to a traumatic kernel at the heart of this well-\nrehearsed teleology. The deferral that drives the movement of imperial ex-\npansion will also void any possibility of eschatological fulfillment. In the \nPhilosophy of History, Hegel links Spirit\u2019s mobility to a dangerous morbidity. \nIf the Idea must continually relocate, if the torch must be constantly handed \non, this is because its incandescence burns, or rather, to shift the metaphor, \nthe poison must continually be expelled; history is the administration of \na time-released toxin whose consumption is fatal to those who secrete it. \n\u201cThe life of a people ripens a certain fruit; its activity aims at the complete \nmanifestation of the principle which it embodies. But this fruit does not fall \nback into the womb of the people that gave birth to it and ripened it; on the \ncontrary, it becomes a bitter drink to it. It cannot leave it alone, for it has an \ninfinite thirst for it; the taste of the drink is its annihilation.\u201d6\nThe image gives a startling twist to Hegel\u2019s more familiar description \nof experience as the organic growth of meaning from seed to blossom to \nfruit and back again (PhG \u00a76). It is actually a small dose of death that is \ntransmitted. The gift becomes, in the present, a kind of poison.

Hegel here essentially defines history as trans-\ngenerational trauma: experience is the belated and vicarious experience of \nthe missed experience of the other.\nMixing metaphors yet again in the preface to the Phenomenology, \nHegel describes history as a blend of the intangible and the intractable. \nEach generation absorbs the experiences of its precursors in \u201csilhouette\u201d \nand as \u201cinorganic nature\u201d (PhG \u00a728).

The path de-\nscribed by Hegel is notoriously more roundabout. The slave could initially \nexperience his own freedom only through a stoic renunciation of bodily \ndesire, a defiance of natural existence, in which the slave ultimately pro-\nlonged his own servitude by miming the heroic self-assertion of the mas-\nter.

If he comes very close to reproducing the standard \nGerman idealist understanding of the relation between philosophy and \nterror\u2014Kantian-style freedom of the will as at once the explication, the \nnegation, and the logical successor of revolutionary freedom\u2014he also un-\ndermines this position: he will immediately argue that such freedom on \nits own terms does nothing to redeem the blocked promise of the Revo-\nlution. Hegel makes it bitterly clear that the sublime purity of the moral \nwill can be no antidote to the terrifying purity of revolutionary virtue. He \ndemonstrates that all the features of absolute freedom are carried over into \nKantian morality: the obsessionality, the paranoia, the suspicion, the sur-\nveillance, the evaporation of objectivity within the sadistic vehemence of \na subjectivity bent on reproducing itself within a world it must disregard.\nMorality is thus prolongation of terror by other means. And Hegel \ngoes farther: the violence will escalate even as Kant\u2019s followers from Schil-\nler onward seek to soften the harshness of the critical project by reinject-\ning sensuousness into morality. The post-Kantian attempt to reunite the \nsubject with the world, to resituate freedom, to give it back its legs, will \nonly further deracinate it. The Romantic project converts Kantian asceti-\ncism into an aestheticism that continues cruelly to rewrite the terms of its \nown existence.\nAll this was only just starting to become visible to readers in France, \nwhere Kant somehow always managed to present an accurate barom-\neter of the political climate. Invoked vaguely as a kindred spirit during \nthe early years of the Revolution, Kant was imported almost immediately \nafter Thermidor as an agent of normalization.

Hegel illuminates the pathological within the nor-\nmal. Exaggeration reveals uncomfortable features of experience that would \nother\u00adwise be invisible. And the exaggeration itself demonstrates just what \nis most distinctive about the phenomenological method. It makes the arti-\nfice and artfulness of the whole procedure explicit: the \u201cshapes (\u00adGestalten) \nof experience\u201d are just that, constructions and fabrications, not found \nbut made\u2014fictional positions, each bearing the indelible stamp of their \nmanufacture.\nSo my intention is not to make either Kant or Hegel any more rea-\nsonable than necessary, or to correct the story, but if anything to exaggerate \nthe conflict. Four features of Hegel\u2019s argument are notable for our pur-\nposes. First, Hegel\u2019s analysis reads like a psychoanalysis. Hegel\u2019s description \nof the contortions of the moral standpoint, whatever its own distortions, \npresents a textbook collection of drives, conflicts, defenses, and symptoms, \nall pointing to a disturbance in object relations, a fundamental failure to \nsocialize, which will ultimately be the gist of Hegel\u2019s critique. Marooned in \nabstraction, the moral agent is cut off from the relationships, institutions, \nand historical traditions that nurture, constrain, and challenge it. The cat-\nalogue of Freudian concepts (and at times even vocabulary) marshaled by \nHegel throughout this section is impressive: repression, perversion, iso-\nlation, splitting, disavowal, fetishism, projection, introjection, incorpo-\nration, masochism, mourning, melancholia, repetition, death drive. But \nthere is nothing psychological or empirical about Hegel\u2019s approach. It is \nKant\u2019s logic and not his motivations that preoccupy Hegel, and the pathol-\nogy here is just the pathology of thinking itself.\nSecond, what Hegel identifies as the neuralgic points of Kantian mo-\nrality are the very points Kant himself highlights to indicate the most pro-\nfound challenges posed by his own philosophy. It does Kant no service, \nfor these purposes, to protect him from Hegel\u2019s onslaught by softening \nthe radicality of his formalism; for example, by showing how Kantian mo-\nrality might be historicized, psychologized, anthropologized, or otherwise \nbrought within the orbit of natural experience. Nor does it do Hegel any \nservice, in this context, to help him fortify his argument so that it becomes \nmore nuanced, less provocative, less strident, less, shall we say, austere.25 \nWhen such projects are undertaken, it is for other purposes; to do so here \n"

The wound is irreparable: \u201cNo matter \nhow far back we direct our attention to our moral state, we find that this \nstate is no longer res integra.\u201d26 So Kant readily concurs with Hegel: to ne-\ngotiate the abyss of freedom, nothing less than a salto mortale would be re-\nquired.27 Kant in this sense resembles either a good analysand, who accepts \nthe interpretation offered, or an infuriating one, who agrees all too readily, \ngamely conceding the analyst\u2019s point and even slyly anticipating it, while \ndoggedly persisting in his beliefs, symptoms and behavior. Like the pervert, \nhe admits to castration while remaining impervious to intervention: \u201cYes, \nI\u2019m castrated! But anyway, as I was saying . . .\u201d This is what makes the per-\nvert strictly unanalyzable. \u201cJe sais bien, mais quand m\u00eame . . .\u201d28\nThird, Hegel holds Kant responsible for all his followers (who will \nin turn merge into an undifferentiated conglomerate). The transforma-\ntion of ascetic ideology into an aesthetic ideology is already signaled, for \nHegel, in the twofold failure of Kant\u2019s own moral theory. Kant fails dou-\nbly: he initiates an impossible situation, and having done so, he fails to \nfollow through; he opens a wound he immediately proceeds to aggravate \nby applying ill-fitting sutures. Morality sustains its own abyssal emptiness \nthrough an imaginary system of supplementary postulates that function \nas all fetishes do\u2014they mask the fissure they secretly acknowledge\u2014an \nartifice whose hypocrisy will become explicit, emphatic, and eventually \nexplosive. Having resorted to an imaginary solution, morality ends up cap-\ntivated by its own theatricality. The moral law swells into the splendid ex-\npression of a genius whose sole mandate is to confirm his own infinite \ncapacity for self-invention.\nFourth and finally: concealed in all this melodrama is the continu-\ning crisis of investiture that defines modernity. Spirit\u2019s inner emigration to \nthe \u201cother land\u201d of philosophical reflection has provided the last and most \nstubborn refuge for a secret inner monarch to reassert his majesty and au-\nthority over a realm of particularity whose inventory has by this point ex-\npanded to include, not only dissidents, aristocrats, and cabbages, but all \nof nature.

To \nsecure its own universality, freedom must define itself against a world of sen-\nsuous particularity, toward which it must nonetheless constantly keep turn-\ning to sustain this very self-definition. Morality is a struggle against a nature \nthat in its recalcitrance must be enlisted if only to supply the energy neces-\nsary to resist it. Duty must solicit the sensibility it suppresses, just as mo-\nrality must secretly hold out for the happiness toward which it must prove \nits indifference. My duty presupposes a gratification that it simultaneously \nprohibits. Since morality defines itself by its antagonism to natural causality, \nevery actualization is self-refuting: to be moral is to undercut the very prem-\nise of morality as such. The very success of morality would spell its terminal \ncollapse into the indifferent plenitude of transient nature. But since moral-\nity also requires a horizon of fulfillment for its coherence, it must postulate \nsuch realization as ultimately attainable\u2014but only in the \u201cdim remoteness\u201d \nof an ever-receding future in which something like jouissance is maintained, \nif only virtually or fictitiously (I\u2019ll come back to this) and at an infinite delay \n(PhG \u00a7603). Kantian morality in this way oscillates between impossibility \nand redundancy. The moral law is either unattainable or a thinly veiled but-\ntress for what is already the case anyway, and the moral agent betrays this \ncontradiction in the contortions with which it simultaneously wards off and \nincites the irrepressible demands of nature both within and without.\nHegel here effectively identifies a perverse core in duty\u2019s endless ritu-\nals of postponement. The negativity at work here is strictly speaking less \nabout repression than about disavowal. Like the fetishist who engages in \n"

In morality, as in consciousness, for which the \nmoral purpose is pure duty, there cannot be any thought at all of differ-\nence, least of all the superficial one of quantity; there is only one virtue, \nonly one pure duty, only one morality\u201d (PhG \u00a7623).\nGod in this way becomes a prosthetic deus ex machina conjured up to \nplug the hole carved by duty itself. The religion that was to have been con-\ntained within reason\u2019s limits is ejected as an excrescence of irrational positiv-\nity. Hegel does not hesitate to call this residue of undigested faith a kind of \nbad faith.

Behind the manifest appeal to solidarity there wafts an unpleasant \nwhiff of calculation. Was the confession motivated by an expectation of \nexculpation through the other\u2019s counterconfession, a distribution of guilt \nbetween confessant and confessor that might dilute the pungency of the \noriginal confession? I acknowledge my fault before you, but only insofar \nas you let me turn me into your accomplice\u2014tu quoque. I confess, yes, to \nerr is human, as you yourself, you of all people, must surely know. . . Seen \nin this light, the testimony becomes an admission without real liability: I \nam prepared to confess as long as it doesn\u2019t specifically implicate me. The \ntransference thus functions forensically as a translatio crimini\u2014a classic \ndefense strategy (for example, in Cicero), whereby the charge is deflected \nby being \u201ctranslated\u201d to another party, including the accuser himself. The \nwhole scene has been rehearsed in front of a mirror: the confessant has se-\nduced himself into a confession on the basis of an imaginary identifica-\ntion with the confessor, and he wants to lure in the other similarly. \u201cIt is \nenticed into confessing by the vision of itself in the other\u201d (PhG \u00a7669). \nCaptivated by the prospect of easy intimacy, the confessant tries to draw in \nthe other through his own disingenuous display of candor. This is the se-\nductive allure of all confession\u2014its theatricality and chronic tendency to \nhypocrisy: it always risks succumbing to the lure of narcissism.\nThe confessor\u2019s silence raises the suspicion that the confession was \ndriven by the desire for spiritual payback. Every claim to validation risks \nregressing to the vulgar calculus of utilitarianism\u2014mutual exoneration \nthrough shared admission. \u201cOne hand washes the other\u201d (PhG \u00a7560). As \nin love (or maybe this is love), it is the demand for equality that thwarts \nthe possibility of reciprocity. Transference provokes countertransference; the \nconfession can only enrage the listener, who is asked to see his own guilt \nmirrored in the other\u2019s disclosure and is repelled by the thumping cama-\nraderie of the performance. Justified or not (it matters little), the rebuke \ndemystifies the unthinking market assumptions that can always threaten \nto corrupt our notions of reciprocity, even while it confirms the meanness \n(Niedertracht) of the judge who loftily sets himself above (hinaufsetzen) it \nall (PhG \u00a7666). Despite or because of its mean-spiritedness, the judge\u2019s si-\nlence contains a glimmer of critical, even emancipatory, potential.

Confession is staged from \nthe outset as a verbal sacrifice or un-saying (Entsagung) of autonomy\u2014\na renunciation (Abwerfen) that both is and is not to be understood as a \nthrowing away (Wegwerfung) of subjectivity. Confession is an experiment \nwith loss that stops short of flat-out abandon\u2014a simultaneous affirma-\ntion and denial in which we can detect a trace of disavowal in the Freudian \nsense\u2014Verwerfung. The confessant \u201cexpects that the other will contrib-\nute his part\u201d to the transaction, that he will seal the deal by answering \nconfession with confession, and it is this expectation that initially seems \nto dignify the transaction: it protects the confessor from debasement or \ndegradation (Ernie\u00addrigung, Demutigung), at least in his own mind (PhG \n\u00a7\u00a7666\u201367). \u201cHe gives himself utterance solely on account of his having \nseen his identity with the other.\u201d The original intention (Meinung) of the \nconfession was to establish reciprocity with the confessant.

Hegel\u2019s expanded confessional culture assumes the infinite \nreversibility of guilt and absolution even while maintaining their asym-\nmetry. The title of this final section, \u201cEvil and its Forgiveness,\u201d contains a \ncrucial ambiguity in that the genitive points in two directions. Evil already \npossesses forgiveness: forgiveness perpetuates evil in the act of absolving \nevil, and it bears the indelible stain of the struggle undertaken to achieve \nthis. Every pardon generates another evil in need of pardon, the complic-\nity is infinite, and suspicion must assume terrorist proportions. The offer \nof forgiveness comes from the one manifestly least qualified to provide it \nand it comes too late.\nThis untimeliness will leave a permanent shadow over the reconcilia-\ntion offered. It will set the accelerated tempo of the resolution (the word of \nreconciliation \u201cbursts forth\u201d [hervorbricht] as if from nowhere [PhG \u00a7786]) \nand accounts for the extreme narrative compression of the account of ab-\nsolute knowing, which the narrative of forgiveness essentially rehearses. \nBreathlessly abbreviated, the final chapter of the Phenomenology will begin \nby recapitulating in skeletal form the entire preceding trajectory of the \nbook\u2014a \u201cshot from the pistol\u201d that seems to display all the impatience \nagainst which Hegel had warned so impatiently in the Preface.

Only in hindsight and through the prism of totality can a random \n\u201csuccession\u201d of experiences be \u201craised into a scientific progression\u201d (cf. PhG \n\u00a787). Seen through the rearview mirror of philosophical reflection, the ac-\ncumulated experiences of Spirit will flash by like fleeting snapshots, a series \nof highlights strung together without the connective tissue of narrative di-\nlation.

Strictly speaking, the hard-\nhearted judge has already long gone under, his part played out, his frag-\nments scattered: his muteness has already exiled him to the symbolic death \nof \u201cmadness\u201d and to the biological death of yearning, tubercular \u201ccon-\nsumption\u201d (Schwindsucht)\u2014twice dead but not yet departed. Having been \nsentenced to an early disappearance (Verschwinden), the beautiful soul can \nonly resurface as a spectral apparition, a Hunter Gracchus figure who hav-\ning missed the moment of his own death somehow finds the inspiration, \ndraws the breath, to continue speaking. The whole scene thus transpires in \nthe Lacanian zone between the two deaths, but there is no glamor or con-\nsolation in the rubble\u2014nothing to shield the subject from the horror of \nits own nullity. The beautiful soul is only \u201cso-called beautiful\u201d (eine sogen-\nnante sch\u00f6ne Seele [PhG \u00a7658])\u2014an apparition of an appearance, the bar-\nest simulacrum of a semblance\u2014and aesthetic ideology is exhausted. It is \nnot the living circuit of communication that is reactivated in this fragile \nconspiratio. The subject returns to language only after having broken the \ncommunicative contract. It speaks as a shattered vessel, a \u201cbroken heart\u201d\u2014\nbeauty petrified and smashed in the mirror of its own image (PhG \u00a7669). \nThere is duress here, even a kind of extortion, but of a peculiar kind. It is \nno longer the slavish fear of death that forces my final capitulation to the \nsocial contract. The worst has already occurred. I am already as good as \ndead. I have nothing left to lose.\nDespite or because of what Derrida aptly refers to, if all too hastily \ndismisses, as Hegel\u2019s own \u201crush toward the economy of a reconciliation\u201d10 \n(the rush is undeniable and deserves analysis: it correlates with the delay \nthat precipitated it), Hegel\u2019s account of forgiveness has a bracingly con-\ntemporary edge. Its starting point is the surd of inexpiable finitude that \nboth thwarts and stimulates every movement toward redemption. And \nit is disfigured by a traumatic temporality of delay. The irreversible (un-\nforgivable) lag between confession and forgiveness dramatizes the defer-\nral constitutive of experience. In this catastrophe is the exaggeration that, \nto paraphrase Adorno again, reveals the truth\u2014namely, that experience is \nthe experience of the impossibility of experience. Far from confirming the \nsubject\u2019s immersion in a restricted economy of exchange, forgiveness has \nthe exorbitance of the gift: it arrives unexpectedly, as from the future, and \nis drawn from the depleted reserves of one who has nothing left to give. \n"

In lifting the biblical exception, Hegel also sharply \nreverses Kant.

He \nintroduces as the occasion for redemption the most intractable obstacle to \nredemption. Hegel appears here simultaneously at his most audacious and \nmost insufferable: even the irredeemable gets drawn into the circuit of rec-\nonciliation.

What we de-\nsire more than anything is to keep on desiring: at least it makes us feel as \nif we were still alive.)

It engages the repetitive, restless energy of \nthe dialectic, its obsessive, circular doing and undoing: every inscription \nsupplies its own erasure, every erasure its own reinscription, and this in-\ntransitive, tautological transition from negation to negation is relentless. \nIt exposes desire to the compulsive, machinelike energy of the drive.

This is another way of saying that forgiveness retro\u00ad\nactively rewrites the terms of the original confession\u2014a perfect example \nof \u201cpositing the presupposition.\u201d It is forgiveness that transforms the \u201ccon-\nfession of sins\u201d (confessio peccatum) into a \u201cconfession of praise\u201d (confessio \nl\u00adaudis) and ultimately into a \u201cconfession of faith\u201d (confessio fidei), to follow \nAugustine\u2019s trajectory: from an act of self-serving self-accusation to an act of \ntestimony and collective affirmation (con-fiteri) that has the radical contin-\ngency of a new beginning.13 The guilty interval between confession and re-\nsponse opens a chasm in which time starts again and the world is suddenly \nreinvented. To say \u201cyes,\u201d as Derrida has noted, is to prolong the conversation \nby forcing an incessant repetition of the beginning; my response prompts \nyou to rephrase the question to which I will answer yes (and yes again). In its \nemptiness is staged the inaugural force of every action\u2014inaugural, yes, but \nonly because too late, and by that token in need of repetition.14\nPut otherwise: \u201cthe \u2018yes\u2019\u201d\u2014strange locution\u2014is neither descriptive \nnor normative. It neither refers nor commands. There is neither\u00a0an ante-\ncedent content to which it assents nor a determinate goal that it prescribes. \nThere are political implications, although they may seem meager; at the very \nminimum Hegel is ruling out every temptation to ethical naturalism. All \naccumulated values have been suspended and there is no symbolic capital \non which to draw. Forgiveness evacuates the substantial plenitude of every \ncommunity, both past and future. The opening to the universal is thus nei-\nther reconstructive (forgiveness does not presuppose the stable identity of \nthe social context) nor constructive (it does not stipulate a social norm). It is \neven unclear by this point either what is being affirmed or who is talking or \nlistening: both speaker and auditor are produced by the speech act, and have \nno existence beyond this. (This is precisely what Lacan means by \u201cheadless \nsubjectification.\u201d)15 \u201cThe \u2018yes\u2019\u201d comes from nowhere, points to nothing, and \ncan be attributed to no one in particular. It is also peculiarly nonidiomatic. \nStrangely nominalized and floating in italics, the word is reduced to a zero \ndegree of meaning and expressivity: spectral, citational, referentially opaque. \nSpeech is hovering on the verge of empty reverberation.\nAlthough it would be outlandish to try to translate this into an in-\nstitutional program, forgiveness demands an immersion in social matters. \n"

Every action, remarks Hegel, is in itself \u201csomething \nperishable\u201d\u2014soggy with contingent interpretations and unforeseeable con-\nsequences (PhG \u00a7405); there is nothing I do which is not the concern of ev-\neryone; \u201cmy thing\u201d becomes a breeding ground for divergent interests and \nopinions; it spills over in uncontrollable directions and draws in others \u201clike \nflies to freshly poured milk\u201d (PhG \u00a7417).17 The opening to the future is the \nopening to the collective. Time is, as Levinas says, the Other. And this im-\nplies, adds Hegel, all the others.

Forgiveness of \n(and by) the unforgivable is the eruption of witness from the grounds of its \nown impossibility. In the end the judge testifies to his own failure to testify \nand language speaks from and of a core of silence.\nDespite its traditional appearance, and despite or because of the abrupt-\nness of its elaboration, Hegel\u2019s notion of forgiveness is, when scratched (and \ninsofar as comparisons add up to an argument), as hyperbolic as anything \nin\u00a0Derrida, as asymmetrical as anything in Levinas, as disastrous as any-\nthing\u00a0in Blanchot, as paradoxical as anything in Kierkegaard. It opens to a \nfuture as natal, as interruptive in its unpredictability, as anything in \u00adArendt, \nand to a past as persistent as anything in Kristeva. Hegel\u2019s account withstands \nNietzsche\u2019s critique of forgiveness as a prolongation of revenge, a debit-credit \ntransaction yielding spiritual payback\u2014he puts the \u201cgift\u201d back into forgive-\nness. He in this way also anticipates a recent wave of \u201cpost-\u00adsecular\u201d read-\nings of Saint Paul (from Agamben and Badiou to \u017di\u017eek) that try to extract \nfrom the aneconomic kernel of Pauline grace, its excessiveness and gratuity, \n"

Instead of overleaping its time with fantasies of regen-\neration, philosophy shuffles in place as it dabs its funereal gray on gray: it \npaints, overpaints, and silently defaces as it mourns its lost futures and its \nfuture losses, commemorating in advance a \u201cshape of life that is old and \ncannot be rejuvenated.\u201d\nWhether painting or dancing (curious aesthetic markers), philoso-\nphy functions as a memento mori, a reminder of transience both past and \nfuture, and as an ars moriendi, a preparation for transcendence. The dance \nis a Totentanz: it rehearses the passage from life to death, from mortal body \nto the eternity of spirit. It could thus be interpreted conservatively as a \nChristian drama of resurrection; grisaille would seem the perfect style in \nwhich to depict this allegorical transfiguration.

How did the scaffold of a state not yet under \nconstruction become in advance a ruin? The prefaces to the Phenomenol-\nogy and to the Philosophy of Right present two sides of one dilemma. The \ngray on gray is the palimpsest of a present that must be read as an anach-\nronism\u2014both a stony tablet on which to write the epitaph for a state not \nyet in existence and a blank canvas on which to trace the vestige of an op-\nportunity already past. The indiscernible gap between gray and gray marks \nthe minimal interval in which the spectator can find a foothold for in-\ntervention. Repetition marks the formal difference separating the present \nfrom itself; it identifies the site where the subject\u2019s agency is both reflected \nand repelled. Hegel is starting to rehearse the antinomies of the modern-\nist avant-garde. If the monochrome hints of the absoluteness of the tabula \nrasa\u2014a utopian movement of transcendence, \u00e0 la Malevich, at once an \nerasure of the past and the preparation of a new beginning\u2014it is haunted \nalso, Richter-like, by the deadly specter of tautology: the entropy, bore-\ndom, and flatness of serial, industrial reproduction, the repetition that an-\nnounces the paralyzing anachronism of the present day.35 In 1820, Hegel is \nbeginning to explore the spectral logic that Marx will soon enough make \nunforgettable: shadows without bodies, phrases without content, history \nwithout events: \u201cif any episode in history has been colored grey on grey, \nthis is the one. Men and events appear as Schlemihls in reverse, as shadows \nthat have lost their bodies.\u201d36 In the Eighteenth Brumaire, the dappling of \ngray on gray announces an impossible mourning for a revolution that did \nnot occur as such; the repetition speaks of the slide from original to copy, \nfrom uncle to nephew, from tragedy to farce. The \u201cmonochromatic for-\nmalism\u201d pilloried by Hegel in the preface to the Phenomenology will haunt \nhis later project like the night in which all cows (or cats, as the saying origi-\nnally went) are gray (cf. PhG \u00a716). The gray suggests the utopian blankness \nof forgiveness, but hints also of something darker; it points to an oblitera-\ntion of missed opportunities and an effacement of unappeasable demands. \nThe Philosophy of Right is in this respect as so many others an endless ne-\ngotiation with the censors.\nSetting aside the quaint details of what exactly Hegel claims to find \nin the newborn state, whose decrepitude he is so emphatically underscor-\ning, we can pause to consider the strange temporality at work. The task of \nphilosophy is to mark the anachronism of the present day. \u201cActualization\u201d \n"

In this way Hegel re-\nturns thought to the order of experience, even if it is a question of a missed \nexperience, a lapsed experience, or even, in the end, another\u2019s experience\u2014\nan experience that came knocking, only to find that \u201cwe, the masters, were \nnot home.\u201d45\n"

E. J. Clery connects \nthis self-affirmation to a crisis of confidence in the British military in the mid-\u00ad\neighteenth century and the subsequent promotion of the citizen\u2019s militia as sym-\nbolic moral supplement\u2014national potency put in reserve and on parade; see \u201cThe \nPleasure of Terror: Paradox in Edmund Burke\u2019s Theory of the Sublime,\u201d in Plea-\nsure in the Eighteenth Century, ed. Roy Porter and Marie Mulvey Roberts (New \nYork: New York University Press, 1996). There is a parallel in Kant\u2019s remark on \nthe sublime profit furnished by the spectacle of the warrior. On some of the gen-\nder issues involved in Burke\u2019s aesthetics of the sublime in relation to his later dis-\ncussion of the French Revolution, see Linda Zerilli, \u201cText/Woman as Spectacle: \nEdmund Burke\u2019s \u2018French Revolution,\u2019\u201d in The Eighteenth Century 33 (1992): 47\u201372.\n17.\u2002 Hence the thuggish reaction of the Savoyard peasant, who lacks the cul-\ntural wherewithal to draw moral profit from the scenery: \u201cIn fact, without the \ndevelopment of moral ideas, that which we, prepared by culture, call sublime will \nappear merely repellent to the unrefined person. He will see in the proofs of the \ndominion of nature given by its destructiveness and in the enormous measure of \nits \u00adpower, against which his own vanishes away to nothing, only the distress, dan-\nger, and need that would surround the person who was banished thereto. Thus the \ngood and otherwise sensible Savoyard peasant (as Herr de Saussure relates) had no \nhesitation in calling all devotees of the icy mountains fools\u201d (Ak 5: 265; CJ \u00a729). \nThe judgment of beauty involves similar constraints. \u201cEveryone says that hunger \nis the best cook, and people with a healthy appetite relish everything that is edible \nat all. . . .  Only when the need is satisfied can we tell who among the multitude \nhas taste or does not\u201d (Ak 5: 210; CJ \u00a75, slightly modified). Implicit is a historiciza-\ntion of aesthetic experience and a social critique of institutions, which the Critique \nof Judgment does not, however, proceed to deliver.\n18.\u2002 Ak 5: 273; CJ \u00a729, p. 155; and cf.

This corresponds to the way Kant char-\nacterizes reflective judgment in the third Critique. The ability to respond to dis-\nenchanted nature as if it were significant text, to find in beauty, for example, the \n\u201ccipher [Chiffreschrift] by means of which nature . . . speaks to us,\u201d is the \u201cmark \n[Kennzeichen] of a good soul\u201d and the \u201csign [Zeichen] of a good moral character \n[Charakter]\u201d (Ak 5: 301; CJ \u00a742). By reading the natural world we render ourselves \nlegible, marking and remarking on our own powers of discernment. This opens \nup a potential infinite regress of signifiers: what is the sign of a \u201ccharacter\u201d if not \nthe sign of a sign? I shall return to the question of moral character. On the motif \nof reading in the third Critique, see Rudolf Makreel, Imagination and Interpreta-\ntion in Kant (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990).\n27.\u2002 See Samuel Weber\u2019s rich exploration of \u201ccommunicability\u201d [Mitteil barkeit] \nin Benjamin\u2019s \u201c-abilities\u201d (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009).\n28.\u2002 Kant uses the term Er\u00e4ugnen in an early draft of the essay; see Fenves, Pecu-\nliar Fate, pp. 245\u201354.\n29.\u2002 There is a second agenda in Kant\u2019s argument: the need to extract the \n\u00adspirit of republicanism from the letter of democracy with which, in France, it has \nbeen conflated. Due to the geographical dispersal of the Germans, Kant claims, \na monarchic constitution is their best defense against powerful neighbors\u2014\nthe shortest way to the enduring peace that is the ultimate aim of republican \nexistence(Ak 7: 86n; CF 302n). This is not merely a pragmatic argument. Kant\u2019s \nrepublican defense of monarchy is theoretically grounded in a categorical distinc-\ntion between formae imperii (forms of sovereignty: autocracy, aristocracy, democ-\nracy) and formae regiminis (forms of governance: republicanism, despotism)\u2014a \ndistinction tied to the opposition between letter and spirit (Ak 6: 340; MM 480). \nThe distinction allows Kant to defend the principle of monarchical rule while \nunequivocally embracing republicanism as a regulative ideal.

Ak 7: 86; CF 302 and Ak 8: 353; PP\u00a0325). \nThe distinction between sovereignty and governance is drawn most sharply in \n\u201cPerpetual Peace,\u201d where Kant assigns to republicanism its minimal definition as \na constitutional separation of executive and legislative powers, an asymptotic ideal \nto which all states must gradually progress. Kant takes democracy, which he iden-\ntifies with direct democracy, to be the form of sovereignty least compatible with \nrepublicanism, inherently despotic in that it collapses the minimal space of rep-\nresentation in which republican distinctions can be secured: \u201cEveryone wants to \nbe ruler.\u201d Kant goes on describe this form of sovereignty, forma imperii, as a non-\nform, \u201cstrictly speaking formless\u201d (eigentlich eine Unform) (Ak 8: 352; PP 324).\n30.\u2002 Ak 6: 342; MM 481. In his unpublished Reflexionen on the Rechtslehre, Kant \nsupplies a metaphysical argument for this claim. According to the logic of political \nsovereignty in France, as Kant presents it here, the king is not a member or \u201cpart\u201d \nof the social totality he represents (unlike the English \u201cking in Parliament,\u201d pri-\nmus inter pares): as its deputy or placeholder (Stellvertreter), he can have no place \nin the presence of this totality. \u201cHe becomes nothing once he lets the whole rep-\nresent itself, since he is only its representative or placeholder, and forms no part \nof it\u201d (Ak 19: 595). King and people cannot logically coexist in a common space \nand time. The king\u2019s convocation of the \u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux in 1789 (the first time they \nhad been summoned since 1614) would by this reasoning already be tantamount \nto abdication.\n31.\u2002 Ak 6: 340; MM 480.\n32.\u2002 Ak 6: 321n; MM 464\u201365.\n33.\u2002 Kant\u2019s main discussions of the right to rebel are in \u201cTheory and Practice\u201d \nat Ak 8: 297\u2013304; TP 296\u2013302, \u201cPerpetual Peace\u201d at Ak 8: 382\u201382; PP 347\u201348, and \nMetaphysics of Morals at Ak 6: 318\u201323; MM 461\u201346.\n34.\u2002 Ak 6: 323; MM 465.

The law rather \nimposes itself on him irresistibly because of his moral disposition\u201d (Ak 6: 35; RR 82)\n36.\u2002 In the Conflict of the Faculties, Kant explicitly draws the connection to the \nprimal scene of childbirth: \u201cThe same goes for political creations as for the cre-\nation of the world; no human was present there, nor could he have been present at \nsuch an event, since he must have been his own creator otherwise\u201d (Ak 7: 92n; CF \n307n). This is one reason why the \u201cparricide\u201d always threatens to turn into a \u201csui-\ncide\u201d (Ak 6: 320, 322n; MM 463, 464n). See Susan Shell\u2019s stimulating discussion \n"

For Michelet, it was the mercilessness of the king\u2019s trial that \nplanted the seeds of the Restoration by unleashing a torrent of popular sympathy \nthat would acquire the aura of sacral forgiveness: denied clemency, Louis would be \n\u201cresuscitated by the force of pity and the virtue of blood\u201d (ibid., 262).

For the importance of Miner-\nva in shaping German liberal attitudes to the French Revolution, see Thomas P. \nSaine, Black Bread\u2014White Bread: German Intellectuals and the French Revolution \n(Columbia, SC: Camden House, 1988), and for its importance to Hegel, Jacques \nd\u2019Hondt, Hegel secret: Recherches sur les sources cach\u00e9s de la pens\u00e9e de Hegel (Paris: \nPresses universitaires de France, 1968). Hegel\u2019s characterization of the boredom or \n\u201cflatness\u201d of the Terror (we shall come to this) is even more arresting in light of the \npervasive sensationalism of the media: is \u201cflatness\u201d a defense against fascination, or \ndoes pornography serve to distract from horror vacui?\n65.\u2002 See p. 161 n. 22 above. Reports of cannibalism are ubiquitous in French \ncounterrevolutionary and Thermidorian reportage.

There is a similar line of argument in the German anti-revolutionary tradi-\ntion (e.g., in Novalis and G\u00f6rres). But political allegiance does not uniformly line \nwith confessional preference; a powerful tradition of radical socialist French Cath-\nolic historians, from Philippe Buchez to Louis Blanc, for example, links the Rev-\nolution\u2019s most profound achievement to the Catholic-style communitarian spirit \nof the Jacobin dictatorship (the \u201cfraternity\u201d period), and its failure to the seeds of \nbourgeois\u2014if not indeed \u201caristocratic federalist\u201d (Buchez)\u2014individualism planted \nby its early Protestant-style beginnings (the \u201cliberty\u201d period).

See \u201c\u00dcber ein vermeintes \nRecht aus Menschenliebe zu l\u00fcgen,\u201d in Ak 8: 425\u201330; \u201cOn a Supposed Right to \nLie from Philanthropy,\u201d in Practical Philosophy, pp. 611\u201315. Constant\u2019s example is \ntaken up verbatim in Sta\u00ebl\u2019s ambivalent (and very inaccurate) treatment of Kant \nin De l\u2019Allemagne, and it is likely that she supplied the anecdotal material; on her \nefforts to smuggle refugees during the Terror, see John Isbell, The Birth of Euro-\npean Romanticism: Truth and Propaganda in Sta\u00ebl\u2019s \u201cDe l\u2019Allemagne\u201d (Cambridge: \nCambridge University Press, 1994), p. 136. Constant\u2019s critique of Kant contains an \nimplicit attack on the Revolution\u2019s rigid adhesion to principles, familiar enough \nfrom Burke and others, but there is a deeper, historical argument also at work: \nthe rigor of the moral law evokes a Spartan severity, which Constant elsewhere \nassociates with the essential anachronism of the Revolution; cf. \u201cDe la libert\u00e9 des \nanciens compar\u00e9e \u00e0 celle des modernes,\u201d in Constant, \u00c9crits politiques (Paris: Gal-\nlimard, 1997); Marx will rework Constant\u2019s argument in the Holy Family.\n16.\u2002 Hegel, Werke 2: 280 ETW 183\u201388.\n17.\u2002 Hegel, Werke 2: 284\u201386; ETW 192\u201394.\n18.\u2002 Hegel, Werke 2: 280, 316; ETW 188, 204.\n19.\u2002 Hegel, Werke 2: 316; ETW 204.

His treatment \nof Romanticism is even harsher than of Kant, and has provoked strong reactions \nfrom Hegel\u2019s more literature-affiliated readers. The syncretism can be disconcert-\ning: the product is a strange amalgam of libertinism, pietism, aestheticism, volun-\ntarism, and more. Harris, Hegel\u2019s Ladder, vol. 2, offers an exhaustive unpicking of \nthe myriad literary allusions throughout this section, as well as a comprehensive \nbibliography of the Hegel literature on this subject (and any other subject in the \nPhenomenology) up to 1997. The position dramatized is a composite figure with \nbits borrowed from everywhere: it takes its conviction from Fichte and Schleier-\nmacher, its introversion from Goethe, its psychosis from H\u00f6lderlin, its inability \nto finish things from Schlegel, its breathlessness from Novalis, its (eventual) abil-\nity to forgive from Jacobi, its preoccupation with moral beauty from all of the \nabove and a few more thrown in for good measure (Schiller, Rousseau, Wieland). \n"

Schlegel deconstructs \nGoethe\u2019s version of the beautiful soul in his novel Lucinde, but Hegel\u2019s analysis \ninvites us to see how Julius and Lucinde reproduce her behavior. For Nietzsche\u2019s \ndescription of the phobic stance of \u201cimmaculate perception\u201d and the fear of cre-\nativity that also drives creativity, see Zarathustra, \u201cOn Immaculate Perception\u201d: \n\u201cBut now your emasculated leering wants to be called \u2018contemplation!\u2019 And what-\never allows itself to be touched by cowardly eyes is to be christened \u2018beautiful\u2019! \nOh you besmirchers of noble names\u201d (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans.

For an attempt to salvage the \npolitical explosiveness of Novalis from the politics of \u201clate\u201d Romanticism (and \nfrom the alleged editorial manipulation and mythography of Ludwig Tieck and \nFriedrich Schlegel), see William Arctander O\u2019Brien, Novalis: Signs of Revolution \n(Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1995).\n60.\u2002 E.g., experimental literary or erotic m\u00e9nages such as those occasional-\nly found in Jena and fictionalized by Schlegel in Lucinde. \u201cThat I am one with \nmyself, that I am what I had the native endowment to become, that I see truth, \nthat I feel harmonious beauty, that is your work, yours alone; and it is my work, \nmine alone, that you too are what you were meant to be, that you too see truth, \nand experience beauty and harmony,\u201d Wilhelm von Humboldt wrote to his wife \n(quoted by W. H. Bruford, The German Tradition of Self-Cultivation: Bildung from \nHumboldt to Thomas Mann [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1975], p. 10). \nHegel mocks the elitism of the pietist conventicles\u2014\u201clittle congregations\u201d that \n\u201cfloat apart and gather together by chance . . . like the patterns in a sea of sand \ngiven over to the play of the winds\u201d (Faith and Knowledge, p. 151).\n61.\u2002 In the Religion, Kant warns against the ever-present risks of misanthropy \nlurking in his own moral rigorism (Ak 6: 34; RR 81); and cf. his remarks in Meta-\nphysics of Morals (Ak 6: 466; MM 582) on allotrio-episcopia (\u201ca mania for spying on \nthe morals of others\u201d) and on moral arrogance [Hochmut] as the flip side of a syco-\nphancy that \u201cwaives any claim to respect from others\u201d (6: 466; MM 582).\n62.\u2002 \u201cNo man is a hero to his valet; not, however, because the man is not a \nhero, but because the valet\u2014is a valet, whose dealings are with the man, not as \na hero, but as one who eats, drinks, and wears clothes\u201d (PhG \u00a7665). The moral \nvalet is an abrasive variant of the \u201ceverlasting irony of the community\u201d that had \nexpressed the crisis of political authority and the collapse of ethical certainty at \nthe end of Sittlichkeit: irony \u201cchanges the universal end of the government into \n"

(The gendering of irony, in this earlier passage, \nas well as everything concealed in this, cannot be pursued here.) The function of \nirony, at this earlier stage, had been to deflate the heroism of every universal claim, \nand to expose the vanity of politics, which it reduced to a vestigial \u201cornament.\u201d \nRomantic irony works similarly, in that it expresses the collapse of moral certain-\nty: it deflates every universal claim by exposing the surd of amour de soi\u2014vanity, \nambition, lust for power\u2014in every moral act. Irony is thus the residue of a failed \nmourning. The corpse takes its revenge on Creon (faith on insight) by turning \ndisenchantment against itself: irony demystifies secular heroism by recalling the \nstench of the particular in every moral act. The valet knows\u2014he has to pick up \nthe laundry.\nHegel\u2019s formulation here, as often, reads like an adage and was destined to \nbecome a quotation. Hegel\u2019s dictum is in fact adapted from Rousseau, who had \nhimself adapted it from Montaigne and others (see Allen Wood\u2019s notes to PhR \n\u00a7124 for a detailed textual history). Goethe adapts the passage in Elective Affinities \n(in Ottilie\u2019s diary). Hegel quotes himself in the Philosophy of Right (PhR \u00a7124), and \nin the Philosophy of History he draws attention to Goethe\u2019s citation of him. \u201c\u2018No \nman is a hero to his valet-de-chambre,\u2019 is a well-known proverb; I have \u00adadded\u2014\nand Goethe repeated it ten years later\u2014\u2018but not because the former is no hero, \netc.\u2019\u201d (VPG 49; PhH 32). At the point of confronting the Romantic fetish of cre-\nativity, Hegel simultaneously underlines and effaces the authorship of his own \ntext; or rather, he emphasizes his own originality vis-\u00e0-vis Goethe, while relegating \nthe aper\u00e7u to proverbial wisdom.\n63.\u2002 Nietzsche, Preface to Twilight of the Idols. Hegel frequently uses the image \nof the hollow vessel in his discussions of Romanticism; see, e.g., Faith and Knowl-\nedge, p. 61: \u201chubbub of vanity without a firm core.\u201d\n64.\u2002 Hegel distinguishes in the Encyclopedia between the abstract or destruc-\ntive negativity of pure sound (a sheer vanishing in time without retention) and the \nconcrete or determinate negativity of the verbal sign, in which meaning is retained \nwithin the inwardness of thought (Enz 3: 116; PhM \u00a7401 Z, p. 87).\n65.\u2002 Nietzsche, \u201cOn the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life,\u201d \u00a75, in \nUntimely Meditations, ed.

Nor can H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s own madness (whatever its relevance) \nbe read as the fate of the isolated aesthete, or without reference to the contem-\nporary political situation (including the strain of the pending treason charge in \n1805, which was eventually dropped on account of his mental condition).

Hegel supplies the sec-\nond part. This is why the thirteenth article of the 1791 French penal code abolished \nthe sovereign\u2019s right to pardon in jury trials as a remnant of absolutism. Kant puts \nhis finger on the theological-political kernel: \u201c[T]he right to grant clemency [ius \naggratiandi] is the slipperiest one for [the monarch] to exercise, for it must be exer-\ncised in such a way as to show the splendor of his majesty, although he is thereby \ndoing injustice in the highest degree\u201d (Ak 6: 336; MM 477). Hegel touches on the \ndilemma in the Philosophy of Right in his discussion of the constitutional monarch \nwhose logical necessity is deduced but precisely for his vacuity\u2014a mere \u201cdot on \nan\u00a0i.\u201d Hegel assigns the monarch a purely ceremonial function, later much derided \nby Marx: he signs forms. The function of the king\u2019s signature is to make symboli-\ncally manifest the presence of individual subjectivity latent in the political order. \nThe monarch also, however, has the sovereign privilege of clemency: \u201conly the sov-\nereign is entitled to actualize the power of the spirit to undo what has been done \nand to nullify crime by forgiving and forgetting [im Vergeben und Vergessen das \n\u00adVerbrechen zu vernichten]\u201d (PhR \u00a7282). In the following remarks, Hegel emphasizes \nthe difference between pardon and forgiveness, which relates to the gap between \nobjective and absolute spirit, already established in \u00a7270 Z. \u201cPardon is the remis-\nsion of punishment, but it is not a cancellation of right. . . .  This cancellation . . . \nmay be effected by religion, for what has been done can be undone in spirit by spirit \n"

Karl-\nHeinz Ilting (Stuttgart: Frommann-Holzboog, 1973\u201374), 4: 342.\n30.\u2002 Marx, who does not engage with Hegel\u2019s discussion of poverty, is also dis-\nmissive of rebellion (Emp\u00f6rung) as a sentimental or subjective response to objec-\ntive social conditions: \u201crevolt\u201d (in the twofold sense of indignation and upheaval) \nhad to be transformed into revolution. See his attack on Stirner in the German \nIdeology, as well as in the Holy Family, chap. 4.\n31.\u2002 Hegel is even harder on reactionary populism: the \u201cpeople\u201d do not know \ntheir own will or even what it means to will, a lack of agency that makes them at \nleast as susceptible to aristocratic manipulation as to revolutionary agitation (PhR \n\u00a7301A; and see Kouvelakis, Philosophy and Revolution, p. 31). \u201cIn the state no one \nof its moments should [soll ] remain as an unorganized mass\u201d (PhR \u00a7303A); Eric \nWeil notes the Kantian formulation in Hegel and the State, trans.
