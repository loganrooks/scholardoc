      "full_text": "FOREWORD \nBy calling three of his works \"critiques,\" Kant indicated their central \nrole in the Critical Philosophy. The Critique of Pure Reason, which \ndetermines the limits of theoretical cognition for the human mind, is \nthe foundation of Kant's mature philosophical thought, and the ideal \napproach to his philosophy would, I suppose, begin with the Critique \nof Pure Reason and work forward systematically. That is to say, as we \nfound various kinds of judgments, we would first analyze the sort of \nclaim to universal assent being made and then attempt to justify that \nkind of claim by tracing it to the necessary principles of our mental \nactivity. But our philosophical development may not parallel Kant's. \nIf we find ourselves drawn to Kant by an interest in, e.g., ethics or \naesthetics, we can go only so far before we get into difficulties. For \nKant's interest in any problem has two aspects, the substantive and \nthe critical. The sort of claim we are making can be analyzed in a way \nthat is intelligible to a wide audience. But the status of that claim \nremains problematic until we have investigated our competence to \nmake it. To justify the principle implicit in our moral judgments, we \nshall have to undertake a Critique of Practical Reason,' to justify the \nprinciple implicit in our judgments about beauty, we must resort to a \nCritique of Judgment. And our investigation inevitably leads back to \nthe Critique of Pure Reason. \nTo the extent that Kant keeps his substantive and his critical \ninterests more or less separate, some of his writings, or parts of them, \nwill be widely read. What Kant has to say on substantive issues has \nproved to be of perennial interest. But the student who becomes \nxv \n"

The \ntext of the Akademie edition of the Critique of Judgment comes from \nthe work's second edition, which was published in 1793 (the first edi-\ntion appeared in 1790); it was edited by Wilhelm Windelband and is \ncontained in volume 5 of the Akademie edition. The First Introduc-\ntion appears in volume 20 (193-251) of the Akademie edition; it was \nedited by Gerhard Lehmann. I have considered variant readings \nthroughout but have indicated them only where I either adopted \nthem or found them of special interest. \nThe translation generally follows the Akademie text in the use \nof parentheses, quotation marks, typographical emphasis, and para-\ngraphing; occasional changes, all but the most trivial of which have \nbeen noted, were made in the interest of clarity. All material in \nbrackets, whether in the text or in footnotes, is my own. German \nterms inserted in brackets are given in their modern spelling and \n(usually) in their standard form (e.g., verbs are given in the infini-\ntive), to facilitate finding them in a modern German dictionary. All \ntranslations given in footnotes are my own, and this fact is not indi-\ncated in each such footnote individually. \nThe pagination along the margin of the text refers to the Akademie \nedition; the unprimed numbers refer to volume 5, the primed num-\nbers to volume 20. All references to the work itself and to the First \nIntroduction are to the Akademie edition; they are given as 'Ak.\u00b7 \nfollowed by the page number and, as applicable, by the number of \nKant's note (\"n.\") or of my bracketed note (\"br. n.\"). (Because clarify-\ning the text made it necessary to cut up Kant's inordinately long \nsentences and to rearrange some of them, as well as some of the more \nconvoluted paragraphs, the correspondence between the numbers on \nthe margins and the pages in the original is only approximate.) Refer-\nences to the translator's introduction are given in roman numerals. \n"

It has two parts, the Critique of Aesthetic Judg-\nment and the Critique of Teleological Judgment. The term 'judgment,' \nin these headings, means the same as 'power (or \"faculty\") of judgment' \n(Urteilskraft), which is simply OUf ability to make (individual) judg-\nments (Urteile },3 \nThe Critique of Aesthetic Judgment deals mainly with two kinds of \naesthetic judgments: judgments of taste, i.e., judgments about the \nbeautiful in nature and in art, and judgments about the sublime. \nKant's main concern is with judgments of taste.

Similarly, \nwe acquired the (empirical) concept of \"animal\" by expanding some \nother concept we already had in our understanding; and so on. In this \nway all empirical concepts are the result of our expanding concepts \nalready present in our understanding. \nNow the only concepts present in our understanding before all \nexperience (from which new empirical concepts are acquired by \nabstraction) are the categories. Hence the categories form part of \n(enter into) all empirical concepts. This holds not only for the con-\ncepts of individual objects but also for the concepts of causal relations. \nFor example, in judging the swelling of some brook as caused by a \nheavy rain that preceded it, we may be matching the empirical \nintuition of this sequence of events with a concept we already have of \na causal relation between events of this kind; but we may, alternatively, \nbe expanding a more general concept which will in tum have resulted \nfrom our expanding a still earlier one, and so on, until we get to the \ncategory of causality, i.e., cause and effect. \nIf an empirical judgment consists in the awareness that an empiri-\ncal intuition matches some concept, how did that match come about? \nThe data we receive passively through sensation are structured in \nterms of space and time and thus become an empirical intuition. If \nthis intuition is to match a concept, we must have an active power or \nability to structure the particular features of that intuition in accor-\ndance with the structure of the concept; this power is what Kant calls \nour 'imagination.' The imagination \"apprehends\" (takes up) what is \ngiven in intuition and then puts together or \"combines\" this diversity \n(or \"manifold\") so that it matches the concept. In this way the \nimagination \"exhibits\" (darstellen, traditionally rendered as \"to \npresent\"U) the concept, i.e., provides it with a matching or \"corres-\nponding\" intuition. \nSome concepts, e.g., those of geometry, can be exhibited in a priori \nintuition, i.e., in intuition that includes no sensation. A priori exhibi-\ntion of a concept is called the concept's 'construction.'12 A priori \nexhibition, like exhibition in empirical intuition, can result in the \nexpansion of the concept exhibited, viz., if we abstract from that \nliMy reasons for abandoning 'to present' as translating 'darstellen' and for reusing it to \nrender 'vorstellen' are given at Ak. 175 br. n. 17. \n12ef. below, Ak. 232 hr. n. 51. \n"

Beyond all possible experience, we cannot have \ntheoretical knowledge but can only think. \nThe concepts we use in thinking about what may lie beyond \nnature, beyond our understanding, are called by Kant 'rational ideas' \nor 'ideas of reason' (or simply 'ideas'). 'Reason' here no longer means \nour cognitive power as a whole, as it does in the title of the first \nCritique, but is used in a narrower sense. In this sense of the term, \nreason is the power that tries, using its ideas, to do more such \nstructuring as understanding does by supplying the concepts that turn \nmere intuitions into experiences. Reason tries to combine these expe-\nriences themselves and the laws they contain into larger unified \nwholes, ultimately into a unity that includes everything, a totality. \nFor example, reason seeks to unify various dog experiences by regard-\ning them as appearances of some one thing underlying all these \nappearances, some (supersensible) thing in itself, whatever it may be, \na thing that we cannot know because we cannot get beyond the \nappearance. In the same way, the general idea of a world in itself is \nthe idea of something supersensible that unites all our experiences of \nnature. But since the structure that reason seeks to introduce by \nmeans of these ideas is a supersensible structure, a structure beyond \nall possible experience, reason can do no more than try: it can use \nthese ideas only to regulate our experience of objects; it cannot use \nthese ideas to constitute objects and so give rise to what would be a \ntheoretical knowledge by reason. The world considered (theoretically) \nas it may be in itself, i.e .\u2022 as supersensible rather than phenomenal, is \nfor us a world of mere noumena, things we can only think. Our \nrational desire to unify our diverse experiences is so great that reason \neasily strays beyond the bounds ~ithin which theoretical knowledge \nis possible for us and consequently involves itself in seeming contra-\ndictions (the \"antinomies\" mentioned above). If we are to avoid such \nstraying by reason, we must let our own critique remind us of lhe \nlimits of our cognitive powers. We must let it remind us that the \ntranscendent metaphysics of dogmatic rationalism is impossible, and \nhence we must restrict ourselves to immanent metaphysics; in other \nwords, we must settle for a metaphysics that confines itself to the \nsynthetic a priori principles (along with their universal applications) \n"

Kant also uses the \nterm 'cognition' in a second sense, according to which theoretical \ncognition is knowledge, rather than the process that yields it. \nLet us turn now to practical cognition, i.e., cognition of what ought \nto be done. In practical cognition, or \"cognition from a practical \npoint of view,\" we again determine an \"object,\" but here we do so by \nmeans of practical determinations taken from our moral consciousness. \nThat is why practical cognition, like morality itself, involves \"oughts,\" \ni.e., commands or \"imperatives.\"24 As we shall see in a moment, one \nsuch \"object\" of our practical cognition is the moral law itself; another \nis the freedom of the will that this law presupposes. As we shall also \nsee, our cognition of these \"objects\" holds for everyone; as such, it \nyields (or, in the second sense of 'cognition,' is) objectively adequate \nassent, i.e., (practical) knowledge. But, because this cognition or \nknowledge is practical, it is not insight. \nOur practical cognition is not limited to the moral law itself and \nwhat this law presupposes, viz., our freedom; we also cognize practi-\ncally what this moral law commanth. As I shall spell out more fully in \na moment, the moral law commands that we try to achieve the \"final \npurpose,\" and achieving the final purpose presupposes two things \nthat we must, therefore, assume as \"postulates\": that there is a God \nand that we are immortal souls. According to Kant, we have practical \ncognition of the final purpose, of God, and of the immortality of the \nsoul inasmuch as these three \"objects\" of our thought are made \n(practically) determinate by what the moral law commands.

When Kant speaks simply of \n\"cognition,\" he ordinarily means theoretical cognition, rather than both it and practi\u00b7 \ncal cognition (which I am about to discuss). Sometimes the omission of 'theoretical' \ngives rise to seeming contradictions. See, e.g., the Critique of Practical Reason, Ak. V, \n4, where 'theoretisch' appears in line 19 but is omitted in line 15, so that line 15 seems \nto contradict what Kant says at Ak. V, 137 concerning our cognition of God. Correcting \nfor the omission removes the seeming contradiction, provided we use different terms to \nrender 'erkennen' (cognize) and 'wissen' (know); rendering them by the same term \nresults in another seeming contradiction between Ak. V,4 and 137. \n24See the Logic, Ak. IX, 86. \n"

Rather, it is a \nrational faith, which is assent that is adequate not objectively but only \nsubjectively, i.e., adequate only to convince oneself.2S \nWith these distinctions in mind, we can now return to the task of \nthe second Critique. The Critique of Pure Reason had indeed estab-\nlished that we can think the previously mentioned supersensible \nthings, i.e., it had established that they are logically possible; but the \nCritique of Practical Reason argues that we can cognize them, even if \nonly practically. Thus the second Critique rescues morality and religion, \nnot only from the restrictive conclusions drawn by the first Critique, \nbut above all-once again-from the much more damaging views that \nmade the Critique necessary: dogmatic rationalism and dogmatic \nempiricism. \nThe dogmatic rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff had tried to derive \nmoral obligation from our alleged knowledge of the supersensible: \nfrom God's will as manifested in the perfection of the world, a \nperfection that we can know through reason although not through the \nsenses. Moral obligation lies in working toward this perfection by \nstriving away from the confusion (indistinctness) inherent in our \nsenses and toward the distinct intellectual \"knowledge\" of the super-\nsensible world as it not only ought to be but in fact is. To have the will \nto act in this way is, for Wolff, nothing more than a somewhat more \ndistinct awareness of this perfection that our senses present to us only \nindistinctly_ We already know Kant's objection to these rationalistic \nclaims to knowledge of the supersensible. But Kant, following (the \nPietist) Christian August Crusius, also disagreed with the view that to \nknow the good is the same as to will it. Above all, however, neither \nLeibniz nor Wolff could adequately explain how the world could \nalready be perfect, through God's choice, and yet have room for \nhuman freedom. \nDogmatic empiricism restricted itself to the observations of empiri-\ncal psychology about human motivation. Accordingly, Hume con-\nstrued ethical judgments as seeking merely to influence people's \nmotivation. One of Kant's objections to this approach was that these \n2SCritique of Pure Reason.

By \nthe same token, there can be no \"fine science\" but only fine art, \nand aesthetics cannot be a \"science\" of the beautiful but only \ncritique.34 \nHence, while the dogmatic rationalists had indeed offered an account \nof the universality of aesthetic judgments, viz., by construing them as \nconceptual and as cognitive judgments about a property, this very \naccount assimilated judgments about beauty to judgments about the \ngood (Ak. 346) and hence failed to explain their aesthetic and there-\nfore subjective character.

Our natural power to receive the idea of beauty when confronted \nby such qualities is analogous to perception: it is a \"sense\" of beauty. \nPerceiving such qualities by this sense produces an immediate (i.e .\u2022 \ndirect) delight. One such quality is formal: the compound ratio of \nuniformity in variety; if either of these is kept constant, \"beauty\" \nvaries with the other. Art imitates, but its \"beauty\" is not that of the \noriginal; it is based on the unity found in the conformity of the work \nwith the original. Another quality that arouses the idea of beauty is \nmoral virtue. Moral virtue can be perceived by the moral \"sense,\" but \nit can alsu produce aesthetic delight. (Vice can be represented beauti-\nfully as well, but only insofar as the representation manifests unity in \nits conformity with the original.) The standard of taste, the standard \nfor judging beauty, is empirical: it is our common human nature, the \nsensibility we have for appreciating uniformity in variety; if we do not \nfind universal agreement regarding judgments of taste. it is only \nbecause we become prejudiced by making irrelevant associations. \nHume. treating judgments of taste as he does moral judgments, \nalso denies that beauty is a quality of things, and speaks of a \"sense\" \nor \"feeling\" of beauty, an ability to receive pleasure from the percep-\ntion of certain qualities of things. or from association with such \nqualities. Hume is not specific about what these qualities are; they \ninvolve structural relations between parts and whole, or a thing's \nutility as it appears to us. The standard of taste is again human nature, \nbut as subject to more qualifications than Hutcheson had spelled out. \nA qualified perceiver must not only be impartial (unprejudiced): the \nperceiver must be calm, as well as experienced in judging beauty, \nespecially beauty in art. By abstracting the common features of \nobjects that have pleased the sense of beauty of such qualified per-\nsons over the ages. we may be able to tell what qualities in general \n(e.g., what formal properties of objects) are capable of producing this \npleasure.

Human nature does not vary so much that such \npersons would greatly disagree, even though perhaps some disagree-\nment, e.g., that due to differences in temperament, cannot be resolved. \nBurke again holds that all there is, as far as beauty is concerned, is \nour idea of it. We have a \"feeling\" of beauty, and we call an object \nbeautiful if it evokes a certain idea, a certain feeling: love without \ninterest. To this account Burke adds an explanation, in terms of the \nphysiology of the day, as to how the object evokes this feeling (cf. Ak. \n277 incl. br. n. 51). Burke does not say much as to what qualities in \nobjects arouse the idea of beauty. As for a standard of taste, Burke \nseems to have assumed that taste is the same in all human beings. \nThe empiricist analysis of beauty by reference to a kind of \"sense\" \nor \"feeling,\" as combined with the denial that beauty is a property of \nthings, accounted well for the aesthetic and subjective character of \njudgments of taste. Kant's complaint against the empiricist analysis is \nthat it fails to account for the fact that judgments of taste demand \neveryone's assent and hence claim a universality and necessity (Ak. \n237), which presupposes some necessary and hence a priori principle. \n\"Scouting about for empirical laws about mental changes\" cannot \nyield this necessity (Ak. 278), nor can \"gathering votes and asking \nother people what kind of sensation they are having\" when facing a \nbeautiful object (Ak. 281), even if as a matter of empirical fact many \npeople happen to agree on a judgment of taste because \"there is a \ncontingent uniformity in the organization of idifferent] subjects\" (Ak. \n345-46).

Hence in such judgments, \nimagination and understanding harmonize without the constraint that \na determinate concept would introduce and thus are in \"free play.\" \nMoreover, since the apprehended form is not compared (matched) \nwith a determinate concept, its purposiveness is not cognized but can \nonly be felt. This feeling (of pleasure) is nothing more than our \nnonconceptual awareness (awareness without a Ideterminate) concept) \nof the form's purposiveness for our cognitive power as such, i.e., \npurposiveness for the harmony of imagination as such with under-\nstanding as such. (Ak. 222.) Anything in nature, as long as our imagina-\ntion can apprehend it in an intuition, can be judged aesthetically: it \ncould be a rose, or it might be some larger part of nature, such as a \ncertain order among species and genera; but in the first case we must \njudge without the concept of a rose, in the second case without a \n(single determinate) concept of such order among species and genera. \nJudgment's principle of nature's purposiveness embodies a constant \nexpectation in accordance with an \"aim\" we have (Ak. 187), viz., \nour aim (or \"endeavor,\" as at Ak. 187) to cognize nature in an \nexperience that coheres even in the particular. Hence when we \nactually find such order in nature, whether in the rose or in some \nlarger but still intuitable part, then we feel a pleasure, as equated by \nKant with our nonconceptual awareness of that purposiveness for our \ncognitive power as such (Ak. 184).

What needs \na justification (\"deduction\") is only the a priori claim of the judgment, \nthe claim that the pleasure (and to this extent the judgment as well) \nhas universal validity (Ak. 289).

As these laws are universal, there can be no natural \nscience without this systematicity.

Now in order for us to judge some natural \nthing as a means, we must judge it as serving (at least mediately, i.e., \nindirectly) an (intrinsic natural) purpose, an organized being (At. \n425). Moreover, once we think of a natural product as a natural \npurpose (which involves the thought of an intention), we must also \nthink of the natural product'S existence as (having) a purpose (At. \n426). For example, we may judge that plants (a kind of organized \nbeing) exist for the sake of herbivores, these for the sake of predators, \nand predators for the sake of man (Ak. 426), so that we arrive at a \nchain of purposes (Ak. 435).

But man is this ultimate purpose subject \nto a condition: he must \"have the understanding and the will\" to \npursue the final purpose (Ak. 431) enjoined by the moral law, i.e., the \nhighest good in the world; this highest good is man's virtue, and man's \nhappiness to the extent that he is virtuous (d. above, xlv).

An intuitive understanding would thus be an understanding \nthat simply determines. and hence would be an understanding \"in the \nmost general sense\" (Ak. 406); for, while any understanding requires \nintuition (to supply the particular needed for cognition: Ak. 406), we \nare not entitled to assume that any understanding must have, as ours \ndoes, an intuition which is separate from it and through which the \nparticular is merely given (empirically) rather than legislated along \nwith the universal (Ak. 402-03). \nSuch an understanding's intuition would thus not be a mere \nreceptivity (which is passive), and hence not a sensibility as our \nintuition is, but would be an intellectual intuition, a complete \nspontaneity (i.e., it would be completely active): it would determine \nobjects completely.

It \nwould constitute these objects through its theoretical legislation rather \nthan \"produce\" (or \"create\") them, for it would not bring objects \nabout practically and hence as contingent, i.e., conditioned by the \nconcept of a purpose (i.e., by an intention) (Ak. 407), but would bring \nthem about without an idea as producing cause (Ak. 408): nature in \nitself would simply be the intellectual (supersensible) intuition of this \nintuitive understanding, just as our world of experience simply is the \nexperience that consists of our empirical intuition as structured in \nharmony with our categories. By the same token, such a supersensible \nunderstanding with its supersensible intuitions cannot be called a \nGod; rather, the idea of it is utterly indeterminate, negative, the mere \nidea of an understanding that \"is not discursive\" (Ak. 406). \nWith this mere idea of an \"intuitive understanding,\" Kant can now \n"

But a far worse problem is that such a \nI07This is how Beck proposes to remove the difficulty with Kant's solution to the third \nantinomy. (Ibid., 192-94.) Beck's suggestion has been developed further by Butts. Butts \nargues that Kant himself makes the categories regulative in the first Critique. (Kallt \nand the Double Government Methodology, esp. 261-63.) It seems to me, however, that \nthis view involves at least the following four major difficulties. First, it flies in the face \nof Kant's entire immanent metaphysics as developed in the Analytic. (Butts emphasizes \nKant's epistemology, but acknowledges that it entails an immanent or \"local\" ontology: \nibid., 243,225.) Second, it undermines Kant's epistemology, which tries to show that \nthere are (theoretical) synthetic judgments tbat are indeed a priori and necessary, and are \nnot merely considered to be so. Third, the evidence Butts offers for his view can easily \nbe interpreted in a different way, one that does not involve any of the difficulties I am \nmentioning here: as far as I can see, none of the citations given by Butts show that Kant \nis making regulative anything but the ideas of reason. That holds even for the passage \nthat Butts seems to consider (ibid., 261) his most important piece of evidence (viz., A \n561-62 = B 589-90): In discussing the fourth antinomy, Kant does indeed include, as \nthe initial part of the regulative principle of reason, a brief characterization of the \nphenomenal world in categorial terms. Yet the principle then continues in nothing but \nthe familiar regulative terms: it seeks to regulate our investigation of nature, by telling \nus (as Kant tells us so often), roughly, that we should try to account for things in \nmechanical terms as far as we can and not appeal too hastily to causes beyond nature. \nWhy, then, should we assume that the initial instruction to regard the phenomenal \nworld first of all in categorial terms is more than a reminder not to (orget that the \nphenomenal world is indeed mechanistic? After all, a methodology (\"regulation\") can \nbe based on an ontology, as Butts himself points out (ibid., 226, and cr. 241). The fourth \ndifficulty with Butts' view strikes me as even more serious than the mentioned three: \nmaking the categories regulative does not in fact solve the third antinomy. For even if \nboth the idea of freedom and the concept of causal necessity are regulative, I still \ncannot without contradiction think them together, i.e., in the same context. And yet I \nmust think them together; for though I can study nature without thinking of freedom, [ \ncannot think about freedom without bringing in nature, because it is in nature that my \nfree will is to make a difference, as Kant points out again and again (e.g., in the Critique \nof Judgment, at Ak. 176 and 196). (We can m course choose to think of only one half of \nthe antinomy at a time; but that holds even for all genuine contradictions and does not \nbegin to remove the contradiction.) I rind it interesting that after Butts construes \nKant's solution of the antinomy of teleological judgment along the same lines as he \ndoes the third antinomy of the first Critique (see above, n. 90), he himself attributes 10 \nKant the view that adopting even the maxims of mechanism and teleology would not \nbe \"consistent\" (ibid., 279) unless we invoke the supersensible (which, like McFarland \nIsee above, xcix-c j, he takes to be an intelligent cause of the world). Yet all that Butts says \nabout this remaining conflict between the two regulative principles, along with Kant's \nalleged solution of it, is that it \"does no harm\" to Kant's ;'essential position on \nteleology\" (ibid., 278), as Butts has interpreted that position. \n"

Or it may come about by nature, \nthrough its technic35 (as in the case of organized bodies), where we \nattribute to nature our concept of a purpose in order to judge its \nproduct; in that case we present not just a purposiveness of nature in \nthe form of the thing, but present the product itself as a natural \npurpose. Although our concept of a subjective purposiveness [mani-\nfested I in nature's forms in terms of empirical laws is not at all a \nconcept of the object, but is only a principle of judgment by which it \nprovides itself with concepts in nature's immense diversity (so that \njudgment can orient itself in this diversity), we are still attributing to \nnature, on the analogy of a purpose, a concern, as it were, for our \ncognitive power.

Saussure,46 \nas intelligent as he was thorough, in describing his Alpine travels says \nof Bonhomme, one of the Savoy mountains, \"A certain insipid sad-\nness reigns there.\" Thus clearly he also knew an interesting sadness, \nsuch as is inspired by a wasteland to which people would gladly \ntransfer themselves so as to hear or find out no more about the world, \nwhich shows that such wastelands cannot, after all, be quite so \ninhospitable as to offer no more to human beings than a most trouble-\nsome abode. This comment is intended only as a reminder that even \ngrief (but not a dejected kind of sadness) may be included among the \nvigorous affects, if it has its basis in moral ideas. If, on the other hand, \nit is based on sympathy, then it may indeed be lovable, but belongs \nmerely to the languid affects. My point is to draw attention to the fact \nthat only in the first case is the mental attunement sublime. \nWe can now also compare the transcendental exposition of aes-\n277 \nthetic judgments we have just completed with the physiological \n46[ See Ak. 265.] \n"

Ak. 189.1 \n19l5innesempfindung, i.e., Empfindung (sensation) as involving a (genuine) Sinn \n(sense) and hence having to do with perception, rather than as meaningjee/ing. This is \nthe very same distinction that Kant has made before, though he did not then use the \ntenn 'Sinnesempfindung' to make it: see \u00a7J, Ak. 205-()6, and cf. Ak. 203-04 and 266 \nincl. br. n. 33. Now although the literal meaning of this term is 'sensation of sense: \nrendering it that way would make it perplexing, since the component terms are cognate \nin English. 'Sensation proper' avoids this difficulty and still captures Kant's meaning: \nfeeling is not sensation proper, precisely because it does not have its own sense. It is \ntrue that Kant sometimes uses even 'sense' in talking about feeling, especially in talking \nabout our \"shared\" or \"common sense\" (\u00a7 \u00a7 20-22, Ak. 237-40, and \u00a7 -40, Ak. 293-96), \nwhich he caus \"not an outer\" sense (M. 238), thus suggesting that it is the inner sense. \nBut in fact Kant does not consider it a (genuine) sense at 1111. Though he uses the term, \nhe uses it much more rarely in the context of feeling than he does the tenn 'sensation,' \nand he uses it very reluctantly: see \u00a7 40, Ak. 293 and esp. 295, and cf. the Metaphysics \nof Morals, Ak. VI, 400. Moreover, in the Anthropology (Ak. VII, 153) he says \nexpressly that, though we might (emphasis added) call feeling an interior se~, this is \nnot to be equated with the inner sense (the \ne ttlrOiiii \nIch \ni \ncognize, .t:Mh~1;.J!:I!!A...m.eT~ ~~~s). And this view is consistent with the fact \nt6a't1G:i't 8J.so-sayS that feeling is a receptiVity that \"belongs to\" or \"is based on\" inner \nsense (Critique of Practical Reason, Ak. V, respectively 58 and BO. Section VIIl of the \nFirst Introduction to the Critique of Judgment can be interpreted similarly: see esp. \nAk. 226', just before the Comment) and in so far can be called \"sensible\" (cf. Ak. 335 \nbr. n. 76) or a feeling \"of' inner sense (as at Ak. 228): inner sense, and through it even \nthe outer senses, besides engaging in sensation proper, are also to some extent \ninvolved in feeling. Cf. \u00a7 3, Ak. 205. The alternative of rendering 'Sinnesemp/indung' \nby some expression referring to an \"organ\" has the difficulty that inner sense does \nnot, strictly speaking, have an organ (so that 'Sinnesemp/indung' would wrongly \nexclude inner sense, and the contrast with feeling would be lost): see Ak. 234 br. \nn.55\u00b71 \n157 \n"

The lungs, meanwhile, rapidly and \nintermittently expel air, and so give rise to an agitation that is condu-\ncive to our health. It is this agitation alone, and not what goes on in \nthe mind, that is the actual cause of our gratification in a thought [by) \nwhich [we I basically present nothing. Voltaire said that heaven has \ngiven us two things to counterbalance the many hardships in life: \nhope and sleep.75 He might have added laughter, if only the means \nfor arousing it in reasonable people were as easy to come by, and \nif the wit or whimsical originality needed for it were not just as \nrare, as the talent is common for people to write, as mystical pon-\nderers do, things that break your head, or to write, as geniuses do, \nthings that break your neck, or to write, as sentimental novelists do \n(also, I suppose, sentimental moralists), things that break your heart. \nIt seems to me, therefore, that Epicurus may certainly be granted that \nall gratification. even if it is prompted by concepts that arouse aes-\nthetic ideas, is animal (i.e., bodily) sensation. For granting this does \n335 \nnot in the least impair the intellectual76 feeling of respect for moral \n75[Henriade. chant 7.J \n76( Geistig. The Geist here is obviously not the \"spirit in an aesthetic sense,\" the \"animat-\ning principle in the mind,\" our \"ability to exhibit aesthetic ideas\" (\u00a7 49, Ak. 313). Since the \nqualification, 'in an aesthetic sense,' is not repeated anywhere as Kant goes on to discuss \nthat kind of Geist. it would be misleading if 'spirit' were used again to render 'Geirt'in a \nnon aesthetic sense (except where the context clarifies what is meant, as it does, e.g., at \nAk. 466 and 467). 'Intellect' seems closest to what Kant has in mind here, in the broad \nsense in which Kant has been using the term 'intellektuell' all along in this work. As for \nthe present case of intellectual feeling. it is true that in one place (Critique of Practical \nReason, Ak. V, 117) Kant says that 'intellectual (intellektuelll feeling' would be a \ncontradiction; for \"811 feeling is sensible\" (ibid., Ak. V, 75). Yet elsewhere he does talk \nabout intellectual feeling; he speaks of \"intellectual [intellektuelll pleasure\" (Anthropology. \nAk. VII. 230), and of \"intellectual (intellektuellJ liking\" (above, Ak. 271 and 230, and \nbelow, Ak. 366). This seeming inconsistency can be resolved as follows. In calling a \nfeeling (the feeling of respect) intellectual, a qualification must be taken as understood: \nthis feeling too, qua feeling, is sensible, a receptivity, though one that does not have its \nown sense (see the Metaphysics of Morals. Ak. VI, 400, and cf. above, Ak. 291 br. n. \n19); but we may still call it intellectual insofar as the basis that gives rire to it is (rational \nand as such) intellectual rather than sensible (Critique of Practical Reason, Ak.

For the latter (the intuitive) can be divided into schematic \nand symbolic presentation: both are hypotyposes, i.e., exhibitions \n352 \n(exhibitiones), not mere characterizations, i.e., designations of con-\ncepts by accompanying sensible signs.

Schemata contain direct, symbols indirect, \nexhibitions of the concept. Schematic exhibition is demonstrative. \nSymbolic exhibition uses an analogy (for which we use empirical \nintuitions as well), in which judgment performs a double function: it \napplies the concept to the object of a sensible intuition; and then it \napplies the mere rule by which it reflects on that intuition to an \nentirely different object, of which the former object is only the \nsymbol.

This much is clear: if we assume that the \nspruce forests are a purpose of nature, then we must also grant that \nthe sand is a purpose, though only a relative one, for which in tum the \nbeach and the withdrawal {of the ancient sea] were the means.

For example, if we say that the crystal lens in the eye has \nthe purpose of bringing about by means of a second refraction of the \nlight rays [the result I that the light rays emanating from one point will \nbe reunited in one point on the retina of the eye, all we are saying is \nthat our thought of the causality nature [exercised] in producing an \neye includcs thc thought of the presentation of a purpose, because \nsuch an idea serves us as a principle by which we can guide our \ninvestigation of the eye as far as its lens is concerned, and also \nbecause thinking the presentation of a purpose here might [heipi us \ndevise means to further that effect [if the natural lens does not do so \nadequately]. But in talking this way we do not yet attribute to nature a \ncause that acts in terms of the presentation of purposes, i.e., inten-\ntionally; if we did, we would be making a determinative teleological \njudgment, and hence a transcendent judgment, inasmuch as it [would I \nsuggest a causality that lies beyond the bounds of nature. \nHence the concept of natural purposes is a concept solely of \nreflective judgment, a concept [it must use I solely for its own sake in \npursuing the causal connection in objects of experience.

This shows that, of the two \nways (aesthetic and teleological) of using the reflective power of \njudgment, the judgment that precedes any concept of the object, and \nhence the aesthetic reflective judgment, is the only one in which the \nbasis determining [it] lies solely in the power of judgment, unmixed \nwith an[y] other cognitive power. Teleological judgments, on the \nother hand, are judgments about the concept of a natural purpose; \nand although in these judgments themselves we use this concept only \nas a principle of the reflective rather than of the determinative power \nof judgment, yet we can make these judgments only by connecting \nreason with empirical concepts. Hence it is easy to show the possibil-\nity of teleological judgments about nature, without our being entitled \nto regard them as based on a special principle of the power of \n244' \njudgment, since [here I judgment merely follows the principle of reason. \nBy contrast, [in order to show] the possibility of a judgment of taste, \ni.e., a judgment of mere reflection that is aesthetic and yet based on \nan a priori principle, we certainly do need a critique of the power of \njudgment as a power having (like understanding and reason) its own \ntranscendental principles, if it can be proved that an aesthetic reflec-\ntive judgment is in fact justified in claiming universal validity.

Teleological judgments, on the \nother hand, do presuppose a concept of the object, a concept that \nreason brings under the principle of connection in terms of purposes, \nand the only [special feature of these judgments] is that the power of \njudgment uses this concept of a natural purpose in a merely reflective \nand not in a determinative judgment. \n"

We shall \nsee later that the purposiveness that [a] form has in appearance is \nbeauty, and that our ability to judge it is taste.
