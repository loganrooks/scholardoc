The country was at war with qermany; the economy was \ncollapsing. The prestige of the Provisional Government, which \nconsisted of liberals and moderate socialists, plummeted. Lenin and \nhis Bolsheviks had always been among the most extreme of the anti-\nRomanov political groups but their influence was small before 1917. \nLenin, born in 1870, had been a clandestine Marxist organiser in the \n1890s. He passed a period in exile in Siberia before migrating in \n1900, and although he returned to Russia in the revolutionary crisis \nof 1905-1907, his subsequent contact with Bolsheviks was difficult. \nNotwithstanding this he was an acknowledged theorist and emigre \nleader, producing books on economics, politics and philosophy; and \nhe edited socialist newspapers. His followers in Russia disliked his \npropensity to split his Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social-\nDemocratic Labour Party into sub-factions. In the First World War \nhis impact on events was frail. It was the abrupt transformation of \nRussian politics after the February Revolution in 1917, when Tsar \nNicholas abdicated, that at last gave him bis chance to become a \nmajor public figure. He offered what he claimed were solutions to \nthe intertwined problems caused by war, eeonomic collapse, social \nand ethnic tensions and political conflict. The Bolsheviks accepted \nhis April Theses as an ideological guide. When the sectional councils \n(or soviets) of workers and soldiers favoured them, in early autumn, \nthey decided to seize power in Petrograd in the October revolution. \nThe State and Revolution was an attempt to supply a rationale for\u00b7 \nthe political and economic order to be built on the ruins of capital-\nism. It was written for revolutionaries not only in Russia but in \nEurope as a whole. Lenin became chairman of the first Soviet \ngovernment. He initiated many social and economic reforms while \nimposing a ruthless dictatorship. The Reds won the ensuing Civil \nWar; but, as popular discontent increased, he conceded a New \nEconomic Policy in 1921. Lenin died in 1924. \nRobert Service is Professor of Russian History and Politics at the \nSchool of Slavonic and Eastern European Studies in the University \n"

This is intended to help \nthose who may want to make a comparison between the texts of \nMarx and Engels.

Only occasionally, moreover, did \nhis choice of words give the translation an unjustifiable, albeit \nusually small, nudge towards his own preferred interpretation of \nMarx\u2019s thought.

He took \na large subject: the task of achieving socialism in modern industrial \nsocieties. Writing the book in summer 1917, he was excited by the \nhope - which to his mind was near-certain of fulfilment - that anti\u00ad\ncapitalist revolutions were imminent throughout Europe. He desired \nto advise socialists on the ways to bring about a new political and \nsocial order.\nLenin was writing under extraordinary conditions. The Russian \nMinistry of the Interior had issued a warrant for his arrest in early \nJuly, and he had fled from Petrograd (which, on his death, was to \nbe renamed Leningrad in his honour) and gone into hiding. At first \nhe and his colleague Grigori Zinoviev hurried to a village near the \nholiday resort town of Sestroretsk. They slept in the hayloft of \nfellow Bolshevik Party member, Nikolai Emelyanov, who had re\u00ad\ntained a local smallholding after moving permanently to work in a \nPetrograd metallurgical factory. But Sestroretsk was only a few \ndozen kilometres from Petrograd. The danger existed that the fugi\u00ad\ntives would be recognized by casual holidaymakers. Officials in the \nMinistry of the Interior had claimed, wrongly, to be able to prove \nthat Lenin was a German agent. Russia was fighting alongside \nBritain and France against Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey \nin the First World War. Italy and the USA had joined the Allies, \nbut Russia\u2019s military plight on the Eastern Front had not improved \nbut worsened in 1917: Lenin and Zinoviev dreaded being arraigned \nat such a moment before a court of law pervaded by anti-German \nhysteria. They decided to leave Sestroretsk for Finland. The Rus\u00ad\nsian authorities had always found it hard to maintain control over \nthe Finnish administration, and the demands for autonomy had \nincreased in recent months.

In the \ncircumstances it seemed wise to them to support the Provisional \nGovernment so long as it upheld democratic policies at home and \ndefended the country efficiently.\nLenin, building on the antagonism to the Provisional Govern\u00ad\nment which already characterized many Bolsheviks, issued his April \nTheses asserting that the emergencies of war and economic disrup\u00ad\ntion were resoluble only through the installation of a government \nof soviets. The Bolshevik Party Conference in late April accepted \nhis case and enjoined its new Central Committee to campaign to \nconvince the working class, the soldiers and the peasants that the \nparty\u2019s representatives should replace the Mensheviks and Socialist \nRevolutionaries in the soviets. The seizure of power in Russia \nbecame the Bolshevik priority. Bolsheviks declared that socialist \nrevolutions in Europe were at hand and that universal peace and \neconomic reconstruction would surely follow. While Lenin casti\u00ad\ngated the Provisional Government as a cabinet serving exclusively \nthe interests of capitalist imperialists, events worked to his advan\u00ad\ntage. In April 1917, Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov had to resign \nafter public protests at his telegram to the Allies to the effect that \nhe espoused the expansionist war aims of Nicholas II. Until then \nonly the Socialist Revolutionary Aleksandr Kerenski had accepted \na ministerial portfolio from the liberals. But in May, a coalition \ncabinet was formed, and Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries \nfrom the soviet leadership acceded to Georgi Lvov\u2019s request that \nthey should join the liberals (or Kadets) in government. Thus the \nanti-Bolshevik socialists became co-responsible for ineffective \nofficial policies which were increasingly unpopular. The Russian \nmilitary offensive on the Eastern Front, which was resumed in \nJune, turned into a debacle adding to the Provisional Government\u2019s \nmisfortunes. Inflation mounted, industrial production shrank, food \nsupplies fell away; and discontent with the cabinet grew not only in \nPetrograd but also in the provinces.\nThe Bolsheviks exploited the situation, calling for a street demon\u00ad\nstration against the governmental coalition on 10 June while the \nFirst Congress of Soviets of Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Deputies would \nbe in session.

For Lenin as a \nMarxist it was axiomatic that governments and their subordinate \nagencies were not impartial in handling conflicts among the classes. \nHe asserted that history was largely a record of \u2018class struggle\u2019 and \nthat the state in any given society inevitably pursues the interests of \nthe ruling class (or classes) at the expense of the rest of society. The \nstate, in Lenin\u2019s blunt description, was \u2018an instrument for the exploi\u00ad\ntation of the oppressed class\u2019. It could and did take various manifes\u00ad\ntations according to the prevailing mode of economic production. \nThus the feudal state differed from the state characteristic of slave\u00ad\nowning societies. The capitalist state, too, had its peculiarities. But \nin each case the laws and institutions and methods of rule corre\u00ad\nsponded to the wishes and needs of the ruling classes. And, while \nstates did not constantly inflict violence on the oppressed and \nexploited classes in society, they always reserved the right to resort \nto it for the maintenance of the existing social order. No ruling \nclass, Lenin declared, allows its rule to be abolished without armed \nstruggle. Revolutions should therefore be expected to be violent. \nThe working class would have to engage in such struggle if ever it \nwas to gain power; and it would have to form a \u2018proletarian\u2019 state.\nCiting Friedrich Engels, the co-founder of Marxism, Lenin empha\u00ad\nsized that the state brought about by socialist revolution would not \nlast eternally. Workers would wield power with a view towards \nthe eventual elimination of all exploitation and oppression. The \nobjective would be the eradication of all class-based discrimination. \nPrivileges, and the antagonisms and conflicts which they engen\u00ad\ndered, would be eliminated. Classes themselves would disappear. \nClass struggle would cease. The need for a state, which is always an \ninstrument whereby one class dominates other classes, would \nvanish. The state would consequently \u2018wither away\u2019.\nChapter II rehearsed the writings of both Karl Marx and Fried\u00ad\nrich Engels on the European revolutions of 1848. Lenin affirmed \nthat both thinkers adhered to two basic propositions: first, that the \n\u2018bourgeois states\u2019 should be dismantled by the workers once they \nhad seized power; second, that the state to be constructed after the \nbourgeoisie\u2019s overthrow would be \u2018the dictatorship of the prolet\u00ad\nariat\u2019.

The \nera of this desired single state syndicate would straddle the years \nbetween capitalism\u2019s overthrow and communism\u2019s inception and \nshould be referred to as socialism. A succession of stages was \ndelineated by him from capitalism through socialism to commu\u00ad\nnism; and it was specified that socialism itself would be inaugurated \nby the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nLenin knew that he was being controversial. His presentation of \nthe writings of Marx and Engels was accompanied by frequent \nprotestations that their most famous twentieth-century followers, \nespecially the German theorist Karl Kautsky, had disfigured their \nintentions. Chapter VI discussed what was depicted as the \u2018vulgariza\u00ad\ntion of Marxism\u2019. The history of the development of Marxist ideas, \naccording to Lenin, needed to be recapitulated if ever Marx\u2019s true \nintentions were to be restored to the light of day.\nKautsky, in the 1890s, had avoided discussion of concepts such \nas the dictatorship of the proletariat. He had expected, as Lenin \npointed out, the socialist state to possess \u2018a sort of parliament\u2019 and \nto use \u2018bureaucratic\u2019 organizational forms for functions like rail \ntransport. Until 1914 Lenin had objected to nothing in this. Now \nhe repudiated it all as \u2018bourgeois parliamentarianism\u2019. Kautsky, for \nLenin, was the fallen idol. The Dutch Marxist Anton Pannekoek \nfor years had attacked Kautsky\u2019s position as a \u2018passive radicalism\u2019 \nwhich was strong on revolutionary rhetoric and weak on real revolu\u00ad\ntionary menace. Lenin agreed that Pannekoek was right to castigate \nKautsky for failing to recognize the dismantlement of the bourgeois \nstate as being essential to Marxism. Yet even Pannekoek was vague \nabout the institutional framework which would take its place. Lenin \nasked why the old ministries could not be replaced by \u2018soviets of \nworkers\u2019 and soldiers\u2019 deputies\u2019. He dismissed the suggestion that \n\u2018primitive democracy\u2019, whereby the people as a whole would partici\u00ad\npate directly in day-to-day administration, was impossible (and \nthus he tacitly repudiated his own views as stated in What is to be \nDone? in 1902). Kautsky\u2019s proposition about the inevitability of \nbureaucracy was ridiculed. Lenin declared that the entire life of \nsociety would be changed by the introduction of the dictatorship of \nthe proletariat.\nHaving completed six out of his planned seven chapters in August \n"

The \nnature of the intended readership may be guessed from the sub\u00ad\nstance and mode of Lenin\u2019s presentation.

Universal literacy was very far from attainment in urban \nRussia, and Marxist tracts appeared in print-runs of only a few \nthousand before the collapse of the Romanov dynasty in the Febru\u00ad\nary Revolution. A determined effort ensued in 1917 to produce \nbooklets, pamphlets and articles which would explain socialism \nand other ideas in popular language. Not only the Bolsheviks but \nalso the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries worked on \nthis. It was a competitive effort. Among the reasons for the invita\u00ad\ntion to Lev Trotski to join the Bolshevik Party in midsummer \n1917 was the knowledge that he was an accomplished propagandist \nand could, better than anyone, establish a newspaper easily readable \nby workers. As things turned out, such a newspaper was not \nfounded by the Bolshevik Central Committee; but Pravda contained \nsections aimed at ordinary working-class people. Even communica\u00ad\ntion with the party\u2019s rank-and-filers had to be conducted in simple \nterms since most of them were entirely new recruits.

It was customary among all generations of Russian revolution\u00ad\naries as well as among Marxists in Europe, and indeed such a \ntradition may be traced back to disputations among the early Christ\u00ad\nian Church Fathers (and, in the period of the Reformation, Luther \nused vulgarities which were vastly more abusive than those of \nMarx and even of Lenin).\nHis opponents predictably incurred a venomous commentary in \nevery chapter. What was more surprising was the abuse meted out to \nthe mass organizations led by them, including the soviets. Here Lenin \nwas at his most acerbic. Under the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolu\u00ad\ntionaries the soviets had allegedly perpetrated \u2018a pollution of disgust\u00ad\ning bourgeois parliamentarianism\u2019.

This is our proletarian task, this is what we must start with \nin carrying out the proletarian revolution.\u2019 Lenin was not a worker: \nhis origins were strictly middle-class; but his autobiographical inaccu\u00ad\nracy was a device to distance himself from the \u2018little intellectuals\u2019 \n(mtelligentki) in other political parties whom he so much detested. \nFurthermore, this sort of language enhanced his ability to purvey a \ngospel of collective solidarity and trouble-free revolution. He at no \npoint proposed that the dictatorship of the proletariat would involve \nsacrifices, whether material or political, for the workers themselves.\nA favourite method was to pose rhetorical questions about any \nimagined difficulties. Thus he asked why the ministries of Kerenski \ncould \u2018not be superseded, let us say, by commissions of specialists \nworking under sovereign, omnipotent soviets of workers\u2019 and sol\u00ad\ndiers\u2019 deputies.\u2019 This particular inquiry was not answered; but the \nensuing sentences overbrimmed with foaming accusations about \nLenin\u2019s opponents, and the author left the impression that no force \non earth could prevent the success of the socialist revolution.\nxxiii\n"

It would no doubt be fanciful to \nassume that this reflected the European perspective of his chapters; \nand even if indeed he was deliberately avoiding specifically national \nthemes and intonations, his prose was still only patchily impressive. \nNot even haste of literary composition and copy-editing can entirely \nexplain this away. At times he appeared almost languid. For in\u00ad\nstance, lists of names of people criticized by him were often left \nuncompleted. Lenin would typically just append a carefree \u2018etcetera\u2019 \nfor the benefit of his readers. On the other hand, he had not lost \nhis talent for inventing slogans. \u2018Accounting and control\u2019, he stated \nin his final two chapters, were the principal requirements of the \nnew social order. The three words (which in Russian are constituted \nby a mere five syllables) are casually reiterated so as to emphasize \nthe ease of the tasks ahead and to give a concrete indication of \nwhat they would involve. The operations would allegedly be \u2018extra\u00ad\nordinarily simple\u2019. Even a \u2018female cook\u2019, a figure traditionally con\u00ad\nsidered to be at the bottom of society in both status and standards \nof intelligence, would be able to play her part.\nIn total contrast to this lightheartedness came his rough and \nheavy treatment of concepts like freedom, equality and democracy. \nLenin was responding to those critics who contended that socialists \nshould aspire to an immediate expansion of \u2018free\u2019 and \u2018democratic\u2019 \nbehaviour. He argued that the disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie \nwould enhance freedom and democracy since the majority of the \npopulation would simultaneously be enabled to enter public life \nfor the first time. He was at his polemical best (or worst). Parlia\u00ad\nments and parliamentarianism, for him, were pejorative words, and, \nalthough he knew that Kautsky and his other Marxist adversaries \nheld no brief for capitalism, he maintained that their reluctance to \nsmash \u2018the bourgeois state machine\u2019 was tantamount to collusion \nwith capitalist class rule. And Lenin declared: \u2018Freedom in capitalist \nsociety always remains roughly the same as it was in the ancient \nGreek republics: freedom for the slave-owners.\u2019 And again: \u2018The \ndemocracy of capitalist society is democracy for an insignificant \nminority, democracy for the rich.\u2019 Yet Lenin also wanted to have it \nboth ways.

The style as much as the contents treated \nconcepts like freedom and democracy extremely bleakly.\nA Marxist Interpretation?\nThe State and Revolution was encased in Marxist-type argumenta\u00ad\ntion, and even Lenin felt compelled to apologize for the many \nlengthy excerpts from Marx and Engels adduced by him. Even so, \nthe very first attacks on the book challenged its Marxist credentials. \nThe leaders of the assault were Karl Kautsky and Yuli Martov. \nKautsky\u2019s interest was obvious: he was the demon of Lenin\u2019s book; \nand Martov was a prominent left-wing Menshevik who increasingly \ndominated Menshevism in the last months of 1917.

While admit\u00ad\nting that Marx had used the term, both insisted that he had intended \nsomething radically different from what Lenin claimed. The Paris \nCommune had not disenfranchised anyone and Marx had not pro\u00ad\nposed that it should.

The call made by Bukharin in \n1915 for the bourgeois state to be crushed seemed like anarchistic \nravings to Lenin, who urged his younger colleague to allow his \nideas time \u2018to mature\u2019 properly. Lenin had felt that both Pannekoek \nand Bukharin had traduced Marxism. It was only in the winter of \n1916-17 that he began to alter his mind in their favour. Even then, \nhowever, he argued differently from them. Whereas they had pre\u00ad\nsented their case on its merits, Lenin sought to demonstrate that he \nwas merely replicating arguments developed originally by Marx \nand Engels. The wish to appear as a loyal disciple pervaded The \nState and Revolution.\nOn a major practical matter he felt impelled to go beyond the \ndiscussions of Bukharin and Pannekoek and to ponder the scenario \nof the post-revolutionary socialist state. He believed, erroneously, \nthat Bukharin contended that the state would immediately cease to \nexist once the socialists had seized power. Bukharin had made no \nsuch contention. And yet it is also true that Bukharin suggested \nthat social and economic reforms could be implemented much \nfaster than Lenin thought, correctly, to be realistic. Lenin stressed \nthat the \u2018dictatorship of the proletariat\u2019 would be a fairly lengthy \nprocess.\nThe need to justify terms like \u2018dictatorship\u2019 was an additional \ninducement to Lenin to resort frequently to quotations from Marx \nand Engels. Kautsky and Martov were well versed in the writings \nof nineteenth-century European socialism and doubted that Marx \nand Engels were the true sources of The State and Revolution. \nInstead they claimed that Lenin had been inspired by authors who \nhad been criticized by Marxism\u2019s co-founders for lacking scientific \nrigour in the formulation of theory and policies - they mentioned \nWilhelm Weitling and Louis-Auguste Blanqui by name. Weitling \nand Blanqui were notorious for their advocacy of sustained mass \nviolence in the making of socialist revolution, and their inclination \nin favour of minoritarian dictatorships was notorious.

Lenin\u2019s theoretical \nmasterpiece was a hotch-potch, and there is little point in trying to \nreconcile the logically irreconcilable.\nNevertheless, this does not mean that there is not a basic vision \nof \u2018politics\u2019 in The State and Revolution. Below the surface of the \nbook\u2019s explicit arguments there lies a stratum of assertions and \nassumptions which tell a great deal about the kind of future political \nlife regarded by the author as being desirable. This stratum, as \nKautsky and Martov were the first to discern, was all the more \nnoteworthy for being proposed mainly in implicit terms.\nLenin\u2019s early critics were aghast at the lacunae in Lenin\u2019s book, \nespecially his failure to say anything about the protection of the \nrights of minorities. In fact, the sole minority he had discussed was \nthe bourgeoisie, and his intention in this regard was to deny all \ncivic rights to the middle classes in society. Lenin\u2019s stated priority \nwas simply to invest the proletariat as a whole with a power ad\u00ad\nequate for the establishment and reinforcement of its dictatorship. \nKautsky and Martov also led the way by drawing attention to the \nscantiness of Lenin\u2019s comments on the role of political parties. The \nState and Revolution barely mentioned them in any general sense. \nThus the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries cropped up as \nthe butt of criticisms of their particular policies; and his principal \nremarks on the Bolsheviks came in a passage where he merely \nadvocated changing their name to Communists (so as to distinguish \nthem once and for all time from other Russian and foreign social\u00ad\nists). Such commentary gave little clue about the advisable functions \nof parties under any forthcoming socialist dictatorship. The irony \nhas not been overlooked by commentators. Lenin, the Marxist who \nhad come to notice with What is to be Done? in 1902 for his almost \nobsessive concern about the structure and duties of his party, had \nno theory of parties under socialism.\nThis was no accident. Lenin treated most parliamentary forms \nof politics with contempt; his references to Houses of Commons, \nReichstags and Dumas are nothing if not bilious.

This class would supposedly become ever more united in \npursuit of its interests as revealed to it by Marxists; it would have \nno need of access to more than one political party. The idea did \nnot cross his mental horizon that the workers, once they had voted \nfor far-left policies, might subsequently turn against them. Nor did \nhe allow for the possibility that sections of the working class might \nstrive politically against each other. And, to the day he died, he \ncontinued to assume that the proportion of propertyless workers in \nmodern industrial societies would continue to grow.\nFurthermore, Lenin was almost silent about the practical tech\u00ad\nniques of administration. Thus he said little about the tendency of \ninstitutions to compete with each other for influence over the state. \nHe equally underestimated the bureaucratic trends common to most \nlarge organizations in their internal arrangements. For all his talk \nabout the possibility of \u2018primitive democracy\u2019, Lenin never rid \nhimself of his admiration of more conventional hierarchical pat\u00ad\nterns. He called for the transformation of 'all citizens into being \nworkers and employees of a single huge \u201csyndicate\u201d\u2019. The scheme \nfor a state-run economic monolith run on the lines of modern \ncapitalist conglomerates held no worries for him. Marxists, accord\u00ad\ning to Lenin, ought to adopt and adapt \u2018bourgeois culture\u2019 for their \nown purposes. Utopian thinker though he was, he always denied \nthat a totally new mode of organization could be invented over\u00ad\nnight. Indeed, he endorsed a remark by a German social-democrat \nin the 1870s that the postal services in advanced capitalist societies \nprovided a model for the socialist order. While conceding that \npost offices currently belong to \u2018a state capitalist monopoly\u2019, Lenin \nasserted that a highly commendable \u2018mechanism of social manage\u00ad\nment is already here to hand\u2019 and that \u2018the entire national economy\u2019 \nshould be organized like a postal service.\nThe difference under socialism, in his prognosis, was that a \n\u2018proletarian\u2019 administration would replace an administration run \nby and for the bourgeoisie. The insistence on hierarchy, specializa\u00ad\ntion and discipline did not betoken a commitment to a spirit of \npolitical and cultural self-development by workers. Lenin blithely \nmaintained that \u2018the great majority of functions\u2019 needing to be \nfulfilled by a modem state were merely tasks of \u2018registration, filing \nand checking\u2019.

He had little excuse. Major contemporary \nwritings were available to him about the pressures of bureaucratiza\u00ad\ntion in industrial societies. Max Weber and Robert Michels were \nalready well-known figures in European intellectual life (and were \nquoted extensively, albeit critically, in pamphlets by Lenin\u2019s close \ncolleague Grigori Zinoviev). The fears of such social theorists about \nthe growth of bureaucratic and authoritarian features were based \non their perception that all known large organizations required the \nexistence of hierarchies of specialist administrators. Neither Weber \nnor Michels offered a panacea for the diseases. Weber turned in \ndespair to the notion that a charismatic leader might by force of \npersonality be able to slow down the advance of bureaucracy. This \nwas wishful thinking, and subsequent European history has shown \nthat such leaders, far from inhibiting, actually tend to facilitate \nbureaucratic self-aggrandizement. All this notwithstanding, Weber \nand Michels were contemporaries of Lenin who recognized that the \npower of the bureaucrat over society was increasing in ways which \nwere not within the capacity of a set of governmental decrees to \nprevent. The State and Revolution was intellectually outdated even \nbefore being published.\nHe began to recognize this problem, fitfully and lamely, only \nafter the October Revolution; but even his deathbed reconsidera\u00ad\ntions in 1922-3 were unaccompanied by a substantial abandonment \nof his earlier assertions and assumptions. Starting from these \npremises, Lenin and his followers were highly likely to adopt ultra\u00ad\nauthoritarian methods when resistance to their rule became a fact \nof life; and the dictatorial aspects of their strategy, which had never \nbeen disguised by Bolshevik leaders, were bound to acquire greater \nprominence.\nThe conclusion must be that the Bolsheviks, however much they \nexpatiated on \u2018democratic dictatorship\u2019 and sought to demonstrate \nhow democratic and free it would be, had no great ideological \ninhibition about becoming dictators of the severest type.

The Bolsheviks \nwon less than a quarter of the votes in the universal-suffrage elec\u00ad\ntions to the Constituent Assembly which met in Petrograd on 5 \nJanuary 1918 and was forcibly dispersed by the Soviet government \nnext day. A political police, the Extraordinary Commission (or \nCheka), had been established in December 1917 as Lenin was putting \nhis book into the hands of the printers. Lenin ensured that the \nCheka\u2019s powers were unrestricted. State institutions in general \nbecame more hierarchical in structure and more authoritarian in \npolicy. Factory-workshop committees were subordinated to the trade \nunions, and these in their turn to the government. A Supreme \nCouncil of the National Economy was created. By summer 1918, \nthe soviets themselves in the provinces were being strictly supervised \nby the central authorities. Working-class strikers were designated \nas hooligans; and, when peasants refused to release grain to the \ntowns, the requisitioning of supplies began. The Bolsheviks refused \nto be disconcerted even by the walk-out of the Left Socialist Revolu\u00ad\ntionaries, who had served as junior partners in the Soviet govern\u00ad\nment from the end of 1917. Not even the fact that those left-wing \nBolsheviks who disapproved of the Brest-Litovsk treaty, the so- \ncalled Left Communists, left their party posts made any difference: \nLenin and his associates brooked no compromise.\nThese developments fitted ill with the aspects of The State and \nRevolution which emphasized local initiative, mass participation \nand popular self-determination.

On the other hand it is undeniable that The \nFoundations of Leninism\u2019s treatment of Lenin crudified him. The in\u00ad\nterpretation of The State and Revolution was a case in point. Stalin \ndwelt overwhelmingly upon the themes of dictatorship, obedience, \nhierarchy, mass mobilization. This was hardly surprising in the mid \n1920s. Stalin as General Secretary was the embodiment of the \nparty\u2019s campaign for order as the Bolshevik central leaders sought \nto reinforce their control over political and economic developments. \nSo stem was the New Economic Policy that some dissentient Bolshe\u00ad\nviks referred to it as New Exploitation of the Proletariat. The clamp\u00ad\ning down on dissent had become a normal mode of thought and \naction, and Stalin\u2019s presentation mirrored this phenomenon.\nThe competition to succeed Lenin ended with Stalin\u2019s complete \nvictory in the late 1920s.

Martov\u2019s ideas survived in the minds of his fellow \nemigres, especially Fyodor Dan who wrote cogently on The Origins \nof Bolshevism. Karl Kautsky, too, maintained his campaign against \nThe State and Revolution until his death in 1938. The tradition \ninitiated by Martov and Kautsky, while noting the authoritarianism \nbasic to The State and Revolution, proceeded to stress that a quan\u00ad\ntum leap of barbarism had been made in the USSR between the \nperiods of Lenin and Stalin. But most other commentators were \nneither Marxists themselves nor attracted to Marxology; and these \non the whole took at its face value Stalin\u2019s claim that Marxism- \nLeninism-Stalinism - as he insisted on calling it - was a seamless \nintellectual web. A Western generation of historians emerged, \nmainly from the 1950s, which re-exposed the claim\u2019s fallaciousness. \nBut their inclination was towards political and economic history, \nand the airy spaces of disputes between Lenin and his critics on \n\u2018the transition from capitalism\u2019 left most of them cold.\nNot all of them, however, were uninterested in ideology.

Lenin \nin What is to Be Done? in 1902, when he became notorious among \nRussian Marxists for his authoritarianism, cited Kautsky in his \ndefence. Both Kautsky and Martov, furthermore, accepted the \nhierarchical discipline of the factory as being in the natural order of \nthings throughout society. They did not rhapsodize about postal \nservices as did Lenin; but their basic attitude was not wholly dis\u00ad\nsimilar.\nOther theorists (and again all were adherents of Marxism) recon\u00ad\nsidered the entire question of workers and of their potentialities. \nThese socialist thinkers existed largely in ignorance of each other, \nbut a crucial concern united them: namely that any revolution \nwhich was intended especially to benefit working people should be \ncarried out mainly by workers and through workers\u2019 organizations \nand according to working-class aspirations.

He \ncastigated Lenin\u2019s authoritarianism, and the two leaders went their \nseparate political ways after 1908. His contempt for Lenin in 1917 \nwas such that he could not be bothered to subject The State and \nRevolution to analysis. Even so, Bogdanov\u2019s ideas were not without \ninfluence on prominent Bolsheviks. Bukharin in particular annoyed \nLenin by taking up the call for a proletarian culture, albeit within \nthe framework of a one-party state so abhorrent to Bogdanov. \nAnother theorist of the Communist International, the Italian \nAntonio Gramsci, combined admiration for Lenin with the un\u00ad\nLeninist notion that the workers\u2019 councils should be the means for \nthe working class to make their own revolution and develop a \ncultural leadership (or \u2018hegemony\u2019) over the rest of society. Not \nsurprisingly, Gramsci threw the liberational aspects of The State \nand Revolution into relief.\nThe Book and Its Fate\nThe final years of the twentieth century have witnessed a collapse \nof the political power of communism in Eastern Europe and of its \nideological attractiveness in Western Europe and elsewhere. This \nwas not widely predicted after Stalin\u2019s death in 1953. The USSR \nwas a military superpower and industrial colossus. In the late 1950s \nits science sent satellites into space, and Soviet politicians expressed \nconfidence that Marxist ideas gave them an unrivalled insight into \nthe future history of mankind.\nThe country\u2019s official version of Marxism none the less changed. \nNikita Khrushchev, who became Soviet Communist Party leader in \nsuccession to Stalin, denounced the deceased dictator at the XXth \nParty Congress in 1956 and revised the party\u2019s account of the \nrecent past. The blood-purges of Stalin and his cronies in the 1930s \nand the 1940s were reported. As Stalin\u2019s image underwent disgrace, \nso Lenin\u2019s was enthusiastically restored to pre-eminent honour. \nThe ending of terror-based politics; the fostering of more relaxed \npublic discussions in the one-party state; the inauguration of \u2018social\u00ad\nist legality\u2019; a heightened priority for agricultural advance: all these \npolicies of Khrushchev were associated at his command with a\nxlviii\n"

Electivity was declared vital to the fair, efficient running \nof both the party and the soviets. Gorbachev took himself off in \nsummer 1987 for a month\u2019s writing near the Black Sea - like Lenin \nin 1917, but with the difference that Gorbachev was in control of \nrather than in flight from the Ministry of the Interior. The result \nwas his book Perestroika. The chapters recapitulated the speeches \nand articles made by the General Secretary in 1985-7 and were \nunderpinned by the proposition that the Soviet Union, after the \nhalf-successful de-Stalinization of Khrushchev and the \u2018stagnation\u2019 \nin public life under Brezhnev, was being restored to the Leninist \npath. Gorbachev referred to The State and Revolution as an inspira\u00ad\ntion of the new politics he desired with their emphasis on elective \nprocedures, open debate and mass participation.\nHis representation of Lenin as a kind of libertarian of orderliness \nwas not unknown in the West. On the contrary, it was among the \nprominent contending interpretations, for those writers wishing to \nexplain why \u2018the Russian Revolution went wrong\u2019 and yet denying \nthat the Civil War\u2019s horrors flowed directly from pre-October poli\u00ad\ncies of the Bolshevik party took comfort in the parts of The State \nand Revolution which pointed to democratic self-expression and \nself-determination. This was always a one-sided interpretation of a \nbook which was not merely multifaceted but also pervaded by \nauthoritarianism. And it was an interpretation continually debated \nand challenged by writers outside the communist states who had a \nmore sceptical notion about the essence of Bolshevism.\nWhat shook observers after 1987 was the unheralded translation \nof the West\u2019s heterogeneity of interpretations to the soil of the \nUSSR. Gorbachev\u2019s benign and far-sighted Lenin started to come \nunder public attack. Soviet writers who had rained careful criticisms \non the regime seized their opportunity to fulminate. Lightning \nflashes smote the trunk of official orthodoxies. Communist Party \nhistorians, asked to defend the party\u2019s past, increasingly opted to \nconcede the scorched intellectual ground.

The reasons were twofold. \nHaving licensed wide-ranging cultural dispute, Gorbachev found it \ntricky to reintroduce limits and risk the charge of returning to the \nbad old days. The second factor was more basic. In 1989 there \noccurred the collapse of communist regimes in most countries of \neastern and east-central Europe. Soviet politics, too, began to \nchange drastically. Other parties emerged. The formal constitu\u00ad\ntional guarantee of the communists\u2019 primacy in the state was \nrevoked in 1990. A flood-tide surged against the banks of Soviet \npublic life. The Congress of People\u2019s Deputies, its chaotic and \nunruly proceedings being presided over by a rancorous Mikhail \nGorbachev, opened a breach through which a new form of politics \nrushed.\nThese politics corresponded less and less to the vision announced \nin The State and Revolution. In 1991 Gorbachev\u2019s closest colleagues \ntried to turn back the floods. A coup against perestroika was \nattempted. It quickly failed. Gorbachev, a prisoner in his Black Sea \ndacha, returned to Moscow to resume his state functions. But he \npaid a price for his liberation to the political forces which had \nopposed the putschists. The Soviet Communist Party was ordered \nto be dissolved and an end was declared to the USSR as a unitary \nstate. Lenin\u2019s portrait was removed from the hall of the Congress \nof People\u2019s Deputies.\nThe State and Revolution still stands as a monument to an era in \nmodern history. Only fools deny that Lenin\u2019s ultimate objectives \nwere not fulfilled in the Soviet Union either in his time or subse\u00ad\nquently. Communism was not realized, and \u2018from each according \nto his abilities, to each according to his needs\u2019 remained a mere \nslogan. The march of history from capitalism through the foothills \nof socialism to the communist peak was not completed. Neverthe\u00ad\nless, The State and Revolution summarized, reinforced and symbol\u00ad\nized real political attitudes and behaviour. Enough was done in \naccordance with its tenets to result in its continuing importance in \ntheory and practice under Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev. These \ntenets related more to its authoritarian than to its libertarian \naspects; and Lenin\u2019s \u2018libertarianism\u2019 was always suffused with a \nfondness for command and subordination and with an antagonism \ntowards compromise and discussion.

The monstrous oppression of the labouring \nmasses by the state, which is fusing itself more and more closely \nwith the omnipotent associations of the capitalists, is becoming \never more monstrous.

According to Marx, the state is \nan organ of class rule, an organ for the oppression of one class by \nanother; it is the creation of \u2018order\u2019, legalizing and perpetuating \nthis oppression by moderating the clashes among the classes. In the \nopinion of petty-bourgeois politicians, order means precisely the \nreconciliation of classes and not the oppression of one class by \nanother; to moderate the conflict means to reconcile classes and \nnot to deprive the oppressed classes of definite means and methods \nof struggle for the overthrow of their oppressors.\nFor instance: when, in the Revolution of 1917, the question \narose in all its magnitude about the significance and role of the \nstate as a practical question demanding immediate action on a \nmass scale, all the SRs (Socialist Revolutionaries) and Mensheviks \nimmediately and completely bowed down before the petty- \nbourgeois theory of the \u2018reconciliation\u2019 of classes by \u2018the state\u2019. \nInnumerable resolutions and articles by politicians of both these \nparties are thoroughly pervaded by this petty-bourgeois and philis\u00ad\ntine theory. That the state is an organ of the rule of a definite class \nwhich cannot be reconciled with its antipode (the class opposite to \nit) is something the petty-bourgeois democrats can never under\u00ad\nstand. Their attitude towards the state is one of the most vivid \nmanifestations of the fact that our SRs and Mensheviks are not \nsocialists at all (a point that we Bolsheviks have always been able to \ndemonstrate) but petty-bourgeois democrats with a quasi-socialist \nphraseology.\nOn the other hand, the \u2018Kautskyite\u2019 distortion of Marxism is \nmuch subtler. \u2018Theoretically\u2019 it is not denied that the state is an \norgan of class rule, or that class contradictions are irreconcilable. \nBut what is lost from sight or fudged is-the following: if the state is \nthe product of the irreconcilability of class contradictions, if it is a \npower standing above society and 'increasingly alienating itself from \nsociety\u2019, then it is clear that the liberation of the oppressed class is \nimpossible not only without a violent revolution but also without \nthe destruction of the apparatus of state power which was created \nby the ruling class and which is the incarnation of this \u2018alienation\u2019. \nAs we shall see later, Marx most definitely drew this theoretically \nself-evident conclusion on the basis of a concrete historical analysis \n9\n"

Let us take for example the very first \nmonths of the Russian democratic republic, one might call it the \nhoneymoon after the \u2018socialist\u2019 SRs and Mensheviks were joined in \nwedlock to the bourgeoisie in a coalition government. If Mr Palchin- \nski obstructed every measure intended to curb the capitalists and \ntheir marauding practices, their pillaging of the treasury by means \nof war contracts; and if later on Mr Palchinski resigned from the \nministry only to be replaced, of course, by another Palchinski of \nexactly the same type, and if the capitalists \u2018rewarded\u2019 him with a \nnice little job at a salary of 120,000 roubles per annum: what would \nyou call this?

A democratic republic is the best possible political \nshell for capitalism, and therefore, once capital has got control of \nthis excellent shell (through the Palchinskis, Chernovs, Tseretelis \nand Co.), it establishes its power so securely, so firmly, that no \nchange of individuals, of institutions or of parties in the bourgeois- \ndemocratic republic can shake this power.\nIt is also necessary to note that Engels is most definite in naming \neven universal suffrage as an instrument of bourgeois rule. Univer\u00ad\nsal suffrage, he says, obviously considering the long experience of \nGerman social-democracy, is\nthe gauge of the maturity of the working class. It neither can nor will give \nany more in the present-day state.\nM\n"

And yet it \nis inseparably connected in a seamless web with the \u2018withering \naway\u2019 of the state.\nHere is Engels\u2019s argument:\nThat force plays another role in history [other than as a perpetrator of \nevil], namely a revolutionary role; that it is, in Marx\u2019s words, the midwife \nof every old society when it is pregnant with the new; that it is the \ninstrument whereby the social movement forces its way through and shat\u00ad\nters the petrified, dead political forms: there is not a word of this in Herr \n19\n"

This letter contains, amongst other things, the \nfollowing remarkable comment.\nAs regards myself, I am due no credit for discovering the existence of \nclasses in modern society or for discovering the struggle amongst them. \nBourgeois historians long before me described the historical development \nof this struggle of the classes, and bourgeois economists the economic \nanatomy of the classes. What I did that was new was to prove the following: \n(1) that the existence of classes is bound up only with definite historical \nphases in the development of production (historiche Entwicklungsphasen \nder Produktion); (2) that class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship \nof the proletariat; (3) that this dictatorship itself constitutes only the tran\u00ad\nsition to the eradication of all classes and to a society without classes . ..\nWith these words Marx succeeded in giving stunningly vivid \nexpression firstly to the main and radical difference between his \ndoctrine and the doctrine of the advanced and most profound \nthinkers of the bourgeoisie; and secondly to the essence of his \ndoctrine on the state.\nThe main point in Marx\u2019s teachings is the class struggle. This is \nvery often said and written. But it is not true. And it is from this \nuntruth that there very often results an opportunist distortion of \nMarxism, its falsification in such a way as to make it acceptable to \nthe bourgeoisie. For the doctrine of the class struggle was created \nnot by Marx but by the bourgeoisie before Marx; and generally \nspeaking it is acceptable to the bourgeoisie. Those who recognize \nonly the class struggle are not yet Marxists; they may be situated \nstill within the framework of bourgeois thinking and bourgeois \npolitics. To limit Marxism to the doctrine of the class struggle \nmeans to chop up Marxism, distort and reduce it to something \nacceptable to the bourgeoisie. Only those persons are Marxists who \nextend the recognition of class struggle as far as the recognition of \nthe dictatorship of the proletariat.

Firstly, he limits his conclusion to the continent. \nThis was understandable in 1871, when England was still the model \nof a purely capitalist country and was without militarism and, to a \nconsiderable degree, without bureaucratism. Marx consequently \nmade an exception of England, where a revolution, even a people\u2019s \nrevolution, then seemed to be and indeed was possible without \nthe preliminary condition of destroying the \u2018ready-made state \nmachine\u2019.\nNow in 1917, in the epoch of the first great imperialist war, this \nreservation by Marx is no longer valid. Both England and America, \nthe largest and ultimate representatives - in the whole world - of \nAnglo-Saxon \u2018liberty\u2019 in the sense of an absence of militarism and \nbureaucratism, have completely sunk into the all-European filthy \nand bloody morass of bureaucratic-military institutions which \nsubordinate everything to themselves and trample everything \nunderfoot.

But the organ of suppression is now the majority of \nthe population, and not a minority as always occurred under slav\u00ad\nery, serfdom and wage slavery. And as soon as it is the majority of \nthe people itself which suppresses its oppressors, a \u2018special force\u2019 \nfor suppression is no longer necessary! In this sense the state begins \nto wither away. Instead of the special institutions of a privileged \nminority (privileged officialdom, the high command of the standing \narmy), the majority itself can directly undertake this, and the more \nthe functions of state power are undertaken by the people as a \nwhole, the less need is left for such a power.\nIn this respect a certain measure of the Commune highlighted by \nMarx is especially noteworthy: the abolition of all financial allow\u00ad\nances for persons chosen as political representatives and of all \nfinancial privileges accorded to officials: the reduction of the pay \nfor all servants of the state to the level of \u2018a workman\u2019s wages\u2019. This \nexpresses, in the sharpest possible way, the break between bourgeois \ndemocracy and proletarian democracy, between the democracy of \nthe oppressors and the democracy of the oppressed classes, between \nthe state as a \u2018special force\u2019for the suppression of a particular class \nand the suppression of the oppressors by the general force of the \nmajority of the people - the workers and the peasants.

As soon as the proletariat conquers political power, \nsuch a measure dictated in the interest of the public good will be just as \neasy to carry out as are other expropriations and billetings by the existing \nstate.\n(p. 22, German edition, 1887)\nThe change in the form of state power is not examined here: only \nthe content of its activity is taken up. Expropriations and occupa\u00ad\ntions of apartments take place even on the orders of the existing \nstate. From the formal point of view the proletarian state will also \n\u2018order\u2019 the occupation of apartments and expropriation of build\u00ad\nings.

Under the latter, \nthe individual worker becomes the owner of the dwelling, the peasant \nlandholding, the instruments of labour; under the former, the \u2018labouring \npeople\u2019 remain the collective owner of the houses, factories and instruments \nof labour.

The actual seizure of all \nthe instruments of labour on the part of the labouring people consequently \ndoes not at all exclude the retention of renting and renting out.\n(p. 68)\nWe shall discuss the question touched upon in this commentary, \nnamely the economic foundations of the withering away of the \nstate, in the next chapter.

These people think \nthat we can change a certain thing by changing its name . ..\u2019\nHaving thus shown that authority and autonomy are relative \nconcepts, that the area of their application changes with the various \nphases of social development, that it is absurd to take them as \nabsolutes, and having added that the area of application of machin\u00ad\nery and large-scale production is ever expanding, Engels moves \nfrom general considerations on authority to the question of the \nstate:\nIf the autonomists [he writes] wanted only to say that the social organiza\u00ad\ntion of the future would confine authority entirely to the limits which are \ninevitably prescribed by the conditions of production, we could come to \nterms with each other. But they are blind to all facts that make authority a \nnecessity, and they passionately fight against the word.\nWhy is it that the anti-authoritarianists do not confine themselves to \nshouting against political authority, against the state? All socialists are \nagreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear \nas a result of the future social revolution, i.e. that public functions will lose \ntheir political character and be turned into the simple administrative func\u00ad\ntions of supervising social interests. But the anti-authoritarianists demand \nthat the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social \nconditions that gave birth to it have been abolished. They demand that the \nfirst act of the social revolution should be the abolition of authority.\nHave these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly\n56\n"

And in posing this question, \nEngels takes the bull by the horns: should not the Commune have \nmade more use of the revolutionary power of the state, i.e. of the \nproletariat armed and organized as the ruling class?\nPrevailing official social-democracy usually shrugged off the ques\u00ad\ntion of the concrete tasks of the proletariat in the revolution either \nwith a philistine sneer or, at best, with the sophistic evasion: \u2018Wait \nand see.\u2019 And the anarchists thus obtained the right to attack such \nsocial-democracy for betraying its task of giving the workers a \nrevolutionary education.

Touching on the question of the state in particular, Engels \nsaid as follows:\nThe free people\u2019s state is transformed into a free state.

Referring to the word \u2018planlessness\u2019 [Planlosigkeit] used \nin the draft programme to characterize capitalism, Engels writes:\nWhen we move from joint-stock companies to trusts which take charge of \nand monopolize whole branches of industry, it is not only private produc\u00ad\ntion but also planlessness that ceases to exist.\n(Die Neue Zeit, vol.

This fact is as follows: before he came out \nagainst the most prominent representatives of opportunism in \nFrance (Millerand and Jaures) and in Germany (Bernstein), Kaut\u00ad\nsky displayed very sharp vacillations. The Marxist journal, Zarya, \nwhich was published in Stuttgart in 1901-2 and advocated revo\u00ad\nlutionary proletarian views, was compelled to polemicize with Kaut\u00ad\nsky and to characterize as \u2018rubbery\u2019 the half-hearted and evasive \nresolution which was conciliatory towards the opportunists and \nwhich he proposed at the International Socialist Congress in Paris \nin 1900.
