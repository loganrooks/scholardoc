Where such standards \nhave become available in one's philosophizing, a type of critical review ori\u00ad\nented to fixed standards is not only justifiable but may also even be urgently \nneeded, and all the more so when the work under discussion is experienced \nas unsettling, provocative, and challenging. But this kind of critical review \nhas been ruled out at present insofar as Jaspers's investigation will not be \njudged with the help of such ideas as \"the absolute validity of truth,\" \"rela\u00ad\ntivism,\" and \"skepticism.\" This type of assessment will be avoided precisely \nbecause the following comments endeavor to sharpen our consciences re\u00ad\ngarding the need to inquire into the genuine sense of the \"history of ideas,\" \nand return radically to the original genetic motivations in this history that \nled to the establishment of such epistemological ideals in philosophy.

In this regard, the meaning of the term \"theory\" is \nitself geared precisely to its origin (cf. Plato, Aristotle). The \"idea\" that \nwe have of the meaning and scope of this task is such that it can scarcely \nbe overestimated. To the contrary, we will come to see what is concretely \n\"necessary\" in philosophy precisely by restricting rmrselves to this task and \nconsciously abandoning aspirations to \"creative\" philosophizing that are in \nfact traditional, even if somewhat historically open-ended. \nIf this critical review emphatically rules out any intention of assess\u00ad\ning Jaspers's work with fixed, highly refined points of reference that have \ndemonstrably not, however, been appmpriated in any radical sense, it is like\u00ad\nwise very suspicious of all indulgent \"philosophies of life\" that make claims \nto free thinking and an apparent primordiality. \"Philosophy of life\" will \nbe called into question by analyzing it to show that the basic philosophical \n3 \n"

A definite orientation is also to be found in the \nbasic approach that will be adopted and enacted in this review. The es\u00ad\nsential characteristic of this approach is expressed precisely in the \"how\" \nof our persisting in it. And this \"how\" of our critical attitude always re\u00ad\nmains subject to a type of appropriation that must constantly renew itself \nin the form of a destruction. Our critical review is phenomenological in \nthe genuine sense, but it is not \"without presuppositions\" in the bad sense. \nHere one turns what is immediately \"on hand\" in one's objective historical, \nintellectual situation into the in-itself of the \"things themselves.\" One fails \nto see what is characteristic of all intuition, namely, that it is enacted in \nthe context of a definite orientation and an anticipatory preconception of \nthe respective region of experience. Thus, when one shuns constructivistic \npoints of view that are foreign to the subject matter, and is concerned with \nimmediacy only in this respect, one's intuition can all too easily fall prey to \na cenain blindness regarding the fact that its own motivational basis is itself \nin the end not primordial. The meaning of primordiality does not lie in the \nidea of something outside of history or beyond it; rather, it shows itself in \nthe fact that thinking without presuppositions can itself be achieved only in \na self-critique that is historically oriented in a factical manner. An incessant \nenactment of our concern for achieving primordiality is what constitutes \nprimordiality. (The term \"historical\"z is used here in a sense that will be\u00ad\ncome somewhat more explicit in the course of the following reflections.) \nThinking without presuppositions is here intended to be taken in a philo\u00ad\nsophical sense and not in a specifically scientific sense. The path that leads \nto the \"things themselves\" treated in philosophy is a long one. Thus the \nexcessive liberties taken recently by many phenomenologists in their use of \nessential intuition appear in a very dubious light, and are hardly in line with \nthe \"openness\" and \"devotion\" to the things themselves preached by these \nphenomenologists. It might just be the case that even the directions of in\u00ad\nquiry in which we could find access to the things themselves of philosophy \nlie covered over for us, and that what is thus necessary is a radical kind of \ndeconstruction and reconstruction, i.e., a genuine confrontation with the \nhistory that we ourselves \"are.\" And this confrontation would be something \nthat is enacted within the very meaning of philosophizing.

To begin with, we need to \nsee but one thing: namely, a preconception about psychical lifo, which is expressed \nin a particular manner, is already given and at v:ork in Jaspers's initial approach \nto the problem of psychical lifo. \nPsychology of worldviews is not supposed to work out a doctrine of life \nand impose it on others; rather, its goal is \"to give clarifications and possibil\u00ad\nities that can serve as means to self-reflection.\" This work of clarification \nmeans clarification of \"life,\" and here \"life\" is seen in some manner. In \nJaspers's initial approach to this clarification, in the techniques he uses for \nit, and in the nature and scope of his goals here, life itself is forced to appear \nunder a certain asped for those who are appropriating such clarifications. If \npossibilities are disclosed, they are possibilities under a certain articulated \naspect of our life and psychical existence, and .for the sake of it. A notion of \nthe essential meaning of the \"how\" of life itself is expressed in this aspect. \nHowever much Jaspers made the attempt to undertake everything in the \nnon prejudicial attitude of mere observation, it is nonetheless the case that, \nwhen we go to understand what he has presented in his observations and \nuse it in our own self-reflection, we are required to adopt, and acquiesce \nin, certain basic approaches to the way in which life and the self are to \nbe intended. If genuine psychology is supposed to allow us to see \"what \nthe human being is\" (5), then the initial manner in which it actually poses \nthe problem must from the stan harbor within it certain preconceptions \nabout the sense of being that belongs to this whole of our psychical, mental \nDasein, and then again preconceptions about the possible \"how\" in accor\u00ad\ndance with which this life, having now been clarified, is supposed to be \nlived, i.e., preconceptions about the basic sense of that in which such things \nas \"possibilities\" can in any sense be brought to light. \nHowever, in seeing these particular preconceptions that accompany \nJaspers's investigations, we should not be tempted to undertake a philo\u00ad\nsophically feeble and sterile type of sham critique in which we would now \nreproach Jaspers for having contradirted his own intentions, maintaining on \nthe basis of this charge that his intentions could never be realized in the \nconcrete, and arguing that his whole project is thus \"refuted in principle\" \nand \"dealt with.\" This type of criticism always claims a formal type of su\u00ad\nperiority in argumentation, but it thereby fails to take up the productive \npossibility of returning in a positive fashion to the thoughts in question and \nunderstanding them in a deeper sense.

This is \nthe case not only because it should be possible for the underlying tendency \nof these problems to be realized in a more consistent and genuine manner, \nbut also and primarily because the object that has been apprehended in \nthese preconceptions is in fact what it is only by virtue of a primordially \nimmanent \"method.\" This method is part of the object's very makeup, and \nis not something merely foisted on the object from the outside. If one is \nnot aware of this problem of explication in a \"rigorous\" enough manner, \none can, to be sure, nonetheless still wind up actually intending the object \nin some manner, but a kind of surrogate will, without further explanation, \nhave been inserted into one's intuition and concepts. This surrogate will \nthen henceforth constantly make demands on us to treat it from different \nsides in order to master it in knowledge (we are motivated to do this on \nthe basis of real acts of intending the object, but these intentions do not \nget involved with the object and grasp it).

Having such a formally indicated \nmeaning, this concept is intended to point to the phenomenon of the \"I \nam,\" i.e., to the sense of being in this \"I am\" that forms the starting point \nof an approach to a context of fundamental phenomena and the problems \ninvolved there. In formal indication (which should be seen to make up the \nfundamental methodological sense of all philosophical concepts and their \nrelationships, though this will not be explained in more detail here), any \nuncritical lapse into a particular interpretation of existence - for example, \nKierkegaard's or Nietzsche's - ought to be avoided from the start, so that we \ncan free up the possibility of pursuing a genuine sense of the phenomenon \nof existence and explicate what comes to the fore in this pursuit.

It is in this muddled fashion that prob\u00ad\nlems in contemporary philosophy are predominantly centered on \"life\" as \nthe \"primordial phenomenon\" in one of two ways. Either life is approached \nas the fundamental reality, and all phenomena are seen to lead back to it, so \nthat everything and anything is understood as an objectification and mani\u00ad\nfestation \"of life.\" Or else life is seen as the formation of culture, and this \nformation is thought to be carried out with reference to normative prin\u00ad\nciples and values. The meaning of this watchword \"life\" should be allowed \nto remain ambiguous, so that it is able to indicate for us all the different phe\u00ad\nnomena that are intended in it. Here we need to single out two directions \nin the sense of this term that have led the way in shaping its meaning, and in \nwhich we find expressed a tendency toward the phenomenon of existence. \n(I) Life is understood as objectifying in the widest sense, as an act of \ncreative formation and achievement, as an act of going out of itself, and \nthus-though this is not clearly spelled out-as something like our \"being \nthere\" [\"Da sein\"] in this life and as this life. \n(z) Life is understood as experiencing, as having an experience, un\u00ad\nderstanding, appropriating, and thus -though again the connection is left \nunexplained-as something like our \"being there\" in such experiencing.) \nThe progress that Jaspers's work makes lies in the fact that his classifi\u00ad\ncation of the phenomena, which have not previously been made available \nin this manner, has called our attention to the problem of existence in a \nmuch more concentrated fashion, and has in connection with this moved \nthe problems of psychology into more fundamental domains. Its philo\u00ad\nsophical shoncoming with respect to the need for actually getting down \nto work and delving into the problems it broaches is clearly visible in the \nfact that Jaspers persists in a certain untested opinion. He thinks that the \npreconception about \"the whole\" that was highlighted above can help him \nget a handle on the phenomenon of existence, and that he can understand \nthis phenomenon precisely by means of those concepts already available to \nhim in his intellectual milieu. \nKeeping in mind the positive tendency of] aspers's work that is directed \ntoward the phenomenon of existence, we now need to discuss the above\u00ad\nmentioned preconception of this work with regard to the methodological \nI J \n"

And this question cannot \nbe answered in a formally deductive manner, but rather only by starting \nfrom particular contexts of phenomena and allowing ourselves to be guided \nby them. It could be that, in accord with its sense, observation always has a \ntheorizing character, but this does not necessarily entail that the sense of be\u00ad\ning belonging to what is observed must as such become accessible primarily \nwithin observation. And it is this simple point that we have been stressing \nin our examination of Jaspers's preconception. The relational sense of the \ninitial giving of the object is not also the relational sense of the explication \nthat has come across this pregiven object. Accordingly, the mere obser\u00ad\nvation that has been used throughout Jaspers's work, and that extends all \nthe way to the preconception in which the actual object of investigation is \ngiven, has in no way been justified by Jaspers as the appropriate method \nof explication. The basic experience in which the actual object is initially \ngiven needs to be examined regarding its full sense, and it must prescribe \nfor us the genuine structure of explication. \"Observation\" in Jaspers's sense \nmight be a fitting approach, but it also might not be. An answer to this \nquestion will be obtained in the following discussion, but for the rime being \nit will take the form of making visible the problems involved here. To this \nend, that which Jaspers has taken up in the preconception of his work must \nbe discussed in more concrete terms. \nThe whole of life, i.e., life itself, is something about which we can say \nnothing directly (z88). But it must indeed be intended by us somehow, \nsince our consciousness of our existence arises precisely from the fact that \nwe look to the whole of life. \\Vhen human beings \"see [their finite situa\u00ad\ntions) within the whole,\" when they \"want to attain certainty about the \ntotality of things,\" they have the experience that the objective world and \ntheir subjective action are split apart in the form of an antinomy. \"Insofar as \nthe driving forces in worldviews move human beings,\" and insofar as human \nbeings are somehow \"concerned about something essential,\" \"they always \nfind themselves on the way to the infinite or the whole.\" It is \"in view of \nthe infinite\" that human beings find themselves in antinomies.

What is it that we strive after in \nthese \"observations\" that are supposed to provide us with the fundamental \npresuppositions, and how do we strive after it? \nIt is possible thatJaspers wants these observations to be understood in \na very formal sense.

This is not to say that Christian theology is the only theology. \nThe most central question is whether, indeed, theology in general is a \nscience. This question is deferred here, not because we wish to evade the \nproblem, but only because that question cannot be asked meaningfully until \nthe idea of theology has been clarified to a cenain extent. \nBefore ruming to the discussion proper, we wish to submit the following \nconsiderations. In accordance with our thesis, we are considering a positive \nscience, and evidently one of a particular kind. Therefore a few remarks \nare in order about what constirutes the positive character of a science as \nsuch. \nProper to the positive character of a science is: first, that a being that in \nsome way is already disclosed is to a cenain extent come upon as a possi\u00ad\nble theme of theoretical objectification and inquiry; second, that this given \npositum is come upon in a definite prescientific manner of approaching and \nproceeding with that being. In this manner of procedure, the specific con\u00ad\ntent of this region and the mode of being of the particular entity show \nthemselves. That is, this disclosure is prior to any theoretical apprehend\u00ad\ning, although it is perhaps implicit and not thematically known. Third, it is \nproper to the positive character of a science that this prescientific comport\u00ad\nment toward whatever is given (nature, history, economy, space, nwnber) \nis also already illwninated and guided by an understanding of being - even \nif it be nonconceptual. The positive character can vary according to the \nsubstantive content of the entity, its mode of being, the manner in which \nit is prescientifically disclosed, and the manner in which this disclosedness \nbelongs to it. \nThe question thus arises: Of what sort is the positive character of the\u00ad\nology? Evidently this question must be answered before we can be in a \nposition to determine its relation to philosophy. But setting down the pos\u00ad\nitive character of theology will not yet sufficiently clarify its status as a \nscience. We have not yet arrived at the full concept of theology as a sci\u00ad\nence, but only at what is proper to it as a positive science. If thematizing \nis supposed to adjust the direction of inquiry, the manner of investigation, \nand the concepruality to the particular positum in each case, it is more to \nthe point here to identify the specific scientific character belonging to the \nspecific positive character of theology. Therefore, only by identifying the \npositive and the scientific character of theology do we approach this disci\u00ad\npline as a positive science and acquire the basis for characterizing its possible \nrelationship to philosophy. \n"

For the \"Christian\" \nfaith, that being which is primarily revealed to faith, and only to it, and \nwhich, as revelation, first gives rise to faith, is Christ, the crucified God. \nThe relationship of faith to the cross, determined in this way by Christ, \nis a Christian one. The crucifixion, however, and all that belongs to it is \na historical event, and indeed this event gives testimony to itself as such \nin its specifically historical character only for faith in the scriptures. One \n\"knows\" about this fact only in believing. \nThat which is thus revealed in faith is, in accordance with its specific \n\"sacrificial\" character, impaned specifically to individual human beings fac\u00ad\ntically existing historically (whether contemporaneous or not), or to the \ncommunity of these individuals existing as a community. The imparting \nof this revelation is not a conveyance of information about present, past, \nor imminent happenings; rather, this imparting lets one \"pan-take\" of the \nevent that is revelation ( = what is revealed therein) itself. But the pan\u00ad\ntaking of faith, which is realized only in existing, is given as such always only \nthrough faith. Furthermore, this \"pan-taking\" and \"having pan in\" the \nevent of the crucifixion places one's entire existence [Dasein] - as a Chris\u00ad\ntian existence, i.e., one bound to the cross - before God. And thereby the \nexistence struck by this revelation is revealed to itself in its forgetfulness of \nGod. Thus - and again I speak only of an ideal construction of the idea -\nbeing placed before God means that existence is reoriented in and through \nthe mercy of God grasped in faith. Thus faith understands itself only in \nbelieving. In any case, the believer does not come to know anything about \nhis specific existence, for instance, by way of a theoretical confirmation of \nhis inner experiences. Rather, he can only \"believe\" this possibility of exis\u00ad\ntence as one which the Dasein concerned does not independently master, \nin which it becomes a slave, is brought before C'..od, and is thus born again. \nAccordingly, the proper existentiell meaning of faith is: faith = rebirth. And \nrebirth does not mean a momentary outfitting with some quality or other, \nbut a way in which a factical, believing Dasein historically exists in that his\u00ad\ntory which begins with the occurrence of revelation; in that history which, \nin accord with the very meaning of the revelation, has a definite uttermost \nend. The occurrence of revelation, which is passed down to faith and which \naccordingly occurs in faithfulness itself, discloses itself only to faith. \nLuther said, \"Faith is permitting ourselves to be seized by the things \nwe do not see\" (Werke [Erlangen Ausgabe], vol. 46, p. 287). Yet faith is \nnot something that merely reveals that the occurring of salvation is some\u00ad\nthing happening; it is not some more or less modified type of knowing. \n44 \n"

Faith is the belin!illg\u00ad\nUIIderstanding mode of existing i11 the history revealed, i.e., ocC'lmng, with the \nCnuified. \nThe totality of this being that is disclosed by faith - in such a way, in\u00ad\ndeed, that faith itself belongs to the context of its disclosure - constitutes \nthe character of the positum that theology finds before it. Presuposing that \ntheology is enjoined on faith, out of faith, and for faith, and presupposing that \nscience is a freely performed, conceptual disclosure and objectification, the\u00ad\nology is constituted in thematizing faith and that which is disclosed through \nfaith, that which is \"revealed.\" It is worthy of note that faith is not just the \nmanner in which the positum objectified by theology is already disclosed \nand presented; faith itself is a theme for theology. And not only that. Inso\u00ad\nfar as theology is enjoined upon faith, it can find sufficient motivation for \nitself only in faith. If faith would totally oppose a conceptual interpreta\u00ad\ntion, then theology would be a thoroughly inappropriate means of grasping \nits object, faith. It would lack something so essential that without this it \ncould never become a science in the first place. The necessity of theol\u00ad\nogy, therefore, can never be deduced from a purely rationally constructed \nsystem of sciences. Furthermore, faith not only motivates the interven\u00ad\ntion of an interpretive science of Christianness; at the same time, faith, as \nrebirth, is that history to whose occurrence theology itself, for its part, is \nsupposed to contribute. Theology has a meaning and a legitimacy only if \nit functions as an ingredient of faith, of this particular kind of historical \noccurrence. \nBy attempting to elucidate this connection [between theology and faith], \nwe are likewise showing how, through the specific positive character of \ntheology, i.e., through the Christian occurrence disclosed in faith as faith, \nthe scientific character of the science of faith is prefigured. \nb) THE SCIENTIFIC CHARACTER OF THEOLOGY \nTheology is the science of faith. \nThis says several things: \n( 1) Theology is the science of that which is disclosed in faith, of that \nwhich is believed. That which is believed in this case is not some coherent \norder of propositions about facts or occurrences which we simply agree to -\nwhich, although theoretically not self-evident, can be appropriated because \nwe agree to them. \n45 \n"

Rather, all such explication must take pains to envision \nand hold constantly in view in its original totality the primary, self-contained \nontological context to which all the basic concepts refer. What does this \nmean for the explication of basic theological concepts? \nWe characterized faith as the essential constitutive element of Christian\u00ad\nness: faith is rebirth. Though faith does not bring itself about, and though \nwhat is revealed in faith can never be founded by way of a rational knowing \nas exercised by autonomously functioning reason, nevertheless the sense of \nthe Christian occurrence as rebirth is that Dasein's prefaithful, i.e., unbe\u00ad\nlieving, existence is sublated [aufgehoben] therein.

But this existentiell overcoming of one's pre-Christian existence \n(which belongs to faith as rebirth) means precisely that one's overcome \npre-Christian Dasein is existentially, ontologically included within faithful \nexistence. To overcome does not mean to dispose of, but to have at one's \ndisposition in a new way. Hence we can say that precisely because all basic \ntheological concepts, considered in their full regional context, include a \ncontent that is indeed existentielly powerless, i.e., ontically sublated, they \nare ontologically determined by a content that is pre-Christian and that can \nthus be grasped purely rationally. All theological concepts necessarily con\u00ad\ntain that understanding of being that is constitutive of human Dasein as \nsuch, insofar as it exists at all.1 Thus, for example, sin is manifest only in \nfaith, and only the believer can factically exist as a sinner. But if sin, which \nis the counterphenomenon to faith as rebirth and hence a phenomenon of \nexistence, is to be interpreted in theological concepts, then the co,ltent of \nthe concept itself, and not just any philosophical preference of the theolo\u00ad\ngian, calls for a return to the concept of guilt. \nBut guilt is an original \nontological determination of the existence of Dasein.l The more originally \nand appropriately the basic constitution of Dasein is brought to light in \na genuine ontological manner and the more originally, for example, the \n5 1 \n"

But \nphilosophy can be what it is without functioningfactically as this corrective. \nThis peculiar relationship does not exclude but rather includes the fact \nthat faith, as a specific possibility of existence, is in its innermost core the \nmortal enemy of the fon of existence that is an essential part of philosophy \nand that is factically ever-changing ... Faith is so absolutely the mortal enemy \nthat philosophy does not even begin to want in any way to do battle with it. \nThis existentie/J opposition between faithfulness and the free appropriation of \none's whole Dasein is not first brought about by the sciences of theology \nand philosophy but is prior to them. Furthermore, it is precisely this opposi\u00ad\ntion that must bear the possibility of a community of the sciences of theology and \nphilosophy, if indeed they are to communicate in a genuine way, free from \nillusions and weak attempts at mediation. Accordingly, there is no such \nthing as a Christian philosophy; that is an absolute \"square circle.\" On the \nother hand, there is likewise no such thing as a neo-Kantian, or axiolog\u00ad\nical, or phenomenological theology, just as there is no phenomenological \nmathematics. Phenomenology is always only the name for the procedure \nof ontology, a procedure that essentially distinguishes itself from that of all \nother, positive sciences. \nIt is true that someone engaged in research can master, in addition to \nhis own positive science, phenomenology as well, or at least follow its \nsteps and investigations. But philosophical knowledge can become gen\u00ad\nuinely relevant and fertile for his own positive science only when, within \nthe problematic that stems from such positive deliberation on the antic \ncorrelations in his field, he comes upon the basic concepts of his science \nand, furthermore, questions the suitability of traditional fundamental con\u00ad\ncepts with respect to those beings that are the theme of his science.

Neither a disposition nor \na process is meant, rather a letting something be taken on (namely, taken \nupon oneself), a being set on oneself (as in the idiom \"he is set on it\"), a \ntaking it on oneself. \nOf itself, drive characteristically leads into activity, not just occasionally \nbut [3 76] essentially. This leading into requires no prior external stimulus. \nDrive is the impulse that in its very essence is self-propulsive. The phe\u00ad\nnomenon of drive not only brings along with it, as it were, the cause, in the \nsense of release, but drive is as such always already released. It is triggered, \nhowever, in such a way that it is still always tensed. Drive can indeed be \ninhibited in its thrust, but even as inhibited it is not the same as a static \ncapacity for acting. Eliminating whatever inhibits it can nevertheless first \nallow the thrust to become free. The disappearance of whatever inhibits it, \nor, to use Max Scheler's felicitous expression, disinhibition [Enthemmung], \nis something other than an additional cause coming from outside. Leibniz \nsays: \"Atque ita per se ipsam in operationem fertur; nee auxiliis indiget, \nsed sola sublatione impedimenti\" [It is thus carried into action by itself and \nneeds no help, but only the removal of an impediment) (ibid.). The image \nof a bent bow illustrates his meaning. The expression \"force\" can therefore \neasily lead us astray, because it suggests the idea of a static property. \nAfter this clarification of vis activa as drive, Leibniz arrives at the essen\u00ad\ntial definition: \"Et hanc agendi virtutem omni substantiae inesse ajo, sem\u00ad\nperque aliquam ex ea actionem nasci\": I say that this power of acting inheres \nin every substance (constitutes its substantiality) and that some action al\u00ad\nways arises from it (ibid., 4 70). In other words, it is drive and is productive. \nProdu.ce1\u00b7e means: to lead something forth, to let it come out of itself and to \nmaintain this outcome in itself. This applies also to corporeal substances. \n"

Leibniz describes vis aaiva also as \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La, with reference \nto Aristode (cf., for instance, the New System, \u00a73). In the Monadolog;y (\u00a7IS) \nhe adds the explanation for this designation: \"car elles ant en elles une \ncenaine perfection (lxo\u2022JaL 'to \u00a3v't\u00a3AEc;)\": for they have in them a certain \nperfection, in a certain manner they carry within them a completeness, \ninsofar as each monad (as will be shown later) brings its positive content \nalready with it, and brings it in such a way that this content is potentially \nthe universe itself. \nThis construal of \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La does not conform to Aristode's real inten\u00ad\ntion. On the other hand, by giving it new meaning, Leibniz claims this very \nterm for his monadology. \nAlready in the Renaissance \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La was translated in the Leibnizian \nsense with peifectibabia; the Monadology, in \u00a748, names Hermolaus Barbarus \nthe translator of the term. In the Renaissance, Hermolaus Barbarus trans\u00ad\nlated and commented on Aristode and on the commentary of Themistius \n(pcr-390), and he did so in order to restore the Greek Aristode against me\u00ad\ndieval Scholasticism. Naturally his task harbored considerable difficulties. \nThe story goes that, compelled by his perplexity over the philosophical \nmeaning of the term tv\"t\u00a3AtX\u00a3La, he invoked the Devil to provide him with \ninstruction. \nAt this point we have explained, in general, the concept of vis activo: \n(I) vis activo means \"drive.\" ( 2) This drive is supposed to be inherent in every \nsubstance as substance. (3) Some accomplishing or carrying out continually \narises from drive. \nBut now we are just coining to the real metaphysical problem of substan\u00ad\ntiality, to the question about the unity of substance as that which primarily \nis. Leibniz calls that which is not substance a \"phenomenon,\" something \nderivative, a surplus. \nThe unity belonging to the monads is not the result of an accumula\u00ad\ntion, a subsequent addition; rather, the unity is to be found in that which \nconfers unity in advance. Unity as the conferral of unity is active, 13 79] vis \naaiva, drive as the primum constitutivum of the unity of substance. Herein \nlies the central problem of the monadology, the problem of drive and of \nmbstantiality. \nThe fundamental character of this activity has now come into view. It \nremains to be seen how drive should itself be unity-conferring. A further \nquestion of decisive importance is: On the basis of this intrinsically unitary \n"

What \nis thereby seen in advance, however, remains uninterrogated ontologically. \nConstant regard for our own existence [Dasein], for the ontological con\u00ad\nstitution and manner of being of one's own \"I,\" provides Leibniz with the \nmodel of the unity he attributes to every being. This becomes clear in \nmany passages. Clarity about this guiding thread is of decisive importance \nfor understanding the monadology. \nDe plus, par le moyen de l'ame ou forme, il y a une veritable unite qui repond a ce \nqu'on appelle MOl en nous; ce qui ne (JSO] sauroit avoir lieu ni dans les machines \nde I' art, ni dans Ia simple masse de Ia matiere, quelque organisee qu'elle puisse etre; \nqu'on ne peut considerer que comme une armee ou un troupeau, ou comme un \netang plein de poissons, ou comme une montre composee de ressorts et de roues. \nBy means of regarding the \"soul\" or the \"form\" there results the idea of a true unity \ncorresponding to what in us is called the \"I\"; such a unity could not occur in artificial \nmachines or in a simple mass of matter as such, however organized (formed) it may \nbe. It can only be compared, then, to an army or a herd, or to a pond full of fish, or \na watch composed of springs and wheels. (Nru\u2022 Synem, \u00a7 1 1) \nSubstantiam ipsam potentia activa et passiva primitivis praeditam, veluti 'to Ego \nvel simile, pro indivisibili seu perfecta monade habeo, non vires illas derivatas quae \ncontinue aliae atque aliae reperientur. \nI regard substance itself, if indeed it has originarily the character of drive, as an indi\u00ad\nvisible and perfect monad - comparable to our ego . . . .

VI, \n499ff.; B. n, 4Ioff.). \nFor the entire problem concerning the guiding thread of self-reflection \nand self-consciousness in general this letter is of great importance.

To think of some color and \nto consider that I think of it - these two thoughts are very different, just as much as \ncolor itself differs from the ego who thinks of it. And since I conceive that there are \nother beings who also have the right to say \"I\" or for whom this can be said, it is \nby this that I conceive what is called subst11ce in general. It is the consideration of \nmyself which provides me also with other metaphysical concepts, such as those of \ncause, effect, action, similarity, etc., and even with those of logic and ethics. (G. VI, \n502; B. 0, 414) \n\"L'Estre meme et Ia Verite ne s'apprend pas tout a fait par les sens\": Being \nitself and truth are not understood completely through the senses (ibid.). \n\"Cette conception de I'Estre et de Ia Verite se trouve done dans ce Moy, \net dans l'Entendement plustost que dans les sens extemes [383] et dans Ia \nperception des objets exterieurs\": This conception of being and of truth is \nthus found in the ego and in the understanding rather than in the external \nsenses and the perception of exterior objects (G.

That is, that which drives traverses itself and is in \nthis way open to itself, and is able to be so by its very essence. \nBecause of this dimensional self-openness, that which drives can there\u00ad\nfore expressly grasp its own self; i.e., in addition to perceiving, it can also \npresent itself at the same time along with its perceiving. It can perceive \nitself concomitantly (ad): it can apperceive. In Principles of Nature and of \nGrace, \u00a74, Leibniz writes: \nAinsi il est bon de faire distinction entre Ia Perception qui est l'etat interieur de Ia \nMonade representant les choses extemes, et /'Apperception qui est Ia Conscience, ou \nIa connaissance reflexive de cet etat interieur, laquelle n'est point donnee a toutes \nles Ames, ny tousjours a Ia meme Arne. \n[So it is well to make a distinction between perception, which is the inner state of the \nmonad representing external things, and apperception, which is consdoumess or the \nreflective knowledge of this inner state itself and which is not given to all souls nor \nto the same soul all the time.) (G. VI, 6o; cf. M011\u00ae/ogy, \u00a72 Iff.) \nIn this viewpoint the whole universe is, as it were, held in view - in a \nparticular perspective of beings and of the possible in each case. But the \nview is refracted in a particular way, namely, in each case according to the \nmonad's stage of drive. That is, it is refracted in each case according to \nthe monad's possibility for unifying itself in its manifoldness. From this it \nbecomes clear [392] that a certain co-presentation of itself is found in the \nmonad as prehensive drive. \nThis unveiling of self can have various degrees, from full transparency \nto insensibility and captivated distraction. No monad lacks perceptio and ap\u00ad\npetiNIS and thus a certain accompanying openness to itself (though this need \nnot be full self-apprehension), if only of the lowest degree. Accordingly, \nthe particular viewpoint, and the correlative possibility of unification, its \nunity, is that which individuates each and every monad. \n"

Yet, in individuation, in the drive from its own particular perspective, \nthe monad unifies the universe prehended in advance only according to the \npossibility of its own perspective. Each monad is thus in itself a mundus \nconcentratus. Every drive concentrates in itself, in its driving, the world in \neach case after its own fashion. \nBut because each monad, in a way of its own, is the world insofar as \nit presents the world, every drive is in consensus with the universe. Be\u00ad\ncause of the consonance [Ein.rtimigkeit] every prehensive drive has with \nthe universe, the monads themselves are also interconnected with one an\u00ad\nother. The idea of the monad as prehensive drive tending toward transition \nimplies that the world belongs in each case to the monad in a perspecti\u00ad\nval refraction, that all monads as units of drive are thus oriented in ad\u00ad\nvance toward a predisposed harmony of the totality of beings: harmqnia \npraestabilita. \nAs the fundamental structure of the actual world, of the actualia, however, \nharmonia praestabilita is that which, as the goal of drive [das Erdriingte), \nstands opposite the central monad, God. God's drive is his will. But the \ncorrelate of divine will is the optimum, \"distinguendum enim inter ea, quae \nDeus potest, et quae vult: potest omnia, vult optima. Actualia nihil aliud \nsunt, quam possibilium (omnibus comparatis) optima; Possibilia sunt quae \nnon implicant contradictionem\" [we must distinguish between the things \nthat God can do and those that he wills to do; he can do all things, but he \nwills the best. Actual things are nothing but the best of possibles, all things \nconsidered. Possible things are those that do not imply a contradiction] \n{letter to Johann Bernoulli, February 2 I, I699; S. II, I I). \n[393] In every monad the whole universe is potentially present. The \nindividuation that takes place in drive as unifying is thus always essentially \nthe individuating of a being that belongs, as monad, to the world. Mo\u00ad\nnads are not isolated pieces producing the world by being added together. \nEach monad, as the drive we have characterized, is in each case and in \nits own way the universe itself. Drive is pre-hensive drive that in each \ncase presents the world from a viewpoint. Every monad is a little world, a \nmicrocosm. This way of speaking does not touch the essential, inasmuch \nas each monad is the universe in such a way that, in its driving, it in each \ncase apprehends the whole world in its unity, although it never comprehends \nit totally. Each monad is, according to its particular level of awakeness, a \nworld history that presents the world. Thus the universe is, in a certain \nsense, multiplied by as many times as there are monads, just as the same \n79 \n"

The monad \nis a living mi11\u00b7or of the univene. \nOne of the most important passages is contained in the letter to de Voider \nfromjune 20, 1 703: \nEntelechias differre necesse est, seu non esse penitus similes inter se, imo principia \nesse diversitatis, nam aliae aliter exprimunt universum ad suum quaeque spectandi \nmodum, idque ipsarum officium est ut sint totidem specula vitalia rerum seu totidem \nMundi concentrati. \nIt is necessary that the entelechies (monads) differ from one another or not be \ncompletely similar to each other. In fact, they (themselves as such) must be the \nprinciples of diversity, for each expresses the universe differently in accordance with \nits own way of seeing (pre-hending). And precisely this is their most proper task, \nthat they should be so many living mirrors of that which is, or so many concentrated \nworlds. (G. IT, z.sr/sz.) \n[394) This statement contains several points: \n( 1) The differentiation of monads is necessary; it belongs to their es\u00ad\nsence. In unifying, each unifies from its own viewpoint, and thus they indi\u00ad\nviduate themselves. \n(2) On account of their way of seeing, perceptio - appetitus, monads are \nthus themselves the origin of their diversity in each case. \n(3) This unifying presentation [Dar-stellen) of the universe in each in\u00ad\ndividuation is precisely what concerns each monad as such in its being (its \ndrive). \n(4) Monads are each the universe in concentrated form. The center \nof concentration is drive determined from a particular viewpoint in each \ninstance: concentrationes tmiveni (G. II, 2 78). \n(5) The monad is speculum vitale [a living mirror] (cf. Principles of Na\u00ad\nture and of Grace, \u00a73; Monadology, \u00a7\u00a763 and 77; and the letter to Remond, \nG. III, 62 3). Mirror, speculum, means a letting-be-seen: miroir adif indivis\u00ad\nible (G. rv, 557; S. I, 146), an actively driving, indivisible, simple mirroring. \nThis letting-be-seen first comes about in the manner of the monad's being, \nwhereby a particular unveiling of world transpires. Mirroring is not a fixed \ncopying, but itself drives as such toward new predelineated possibilities of \nitself. The mirror is simple because it possesses in advance the one universe \nwithin a single viewpoint from which the manifold first becomes visible. \nFrom this we can grasp more sharply the essence of finite substance \nfrom an aspect we have not yet considered. Leibniz says in his letter to de \n8o \n"

II, 249): \"omnis substantia est activa, et omnis \nsubstantia finita est passiva, passioni autem connexa resistentia est.\" [Every \nsubstance is active and every finite substance is passive, and connected with \nthis passivity is resistance.] What is this supposed to mean? \nInsofar as the monad is always the whole within a single viewpoint, the \ngrounds of its finitude lie precisely in its being related to the order of the \nuniverse in this way. The monad relates to a resistance, to something it \nis not but could well be. Drive is indeed active, yet in every finite drive \noccurring in a particular [395] perspective, there is always and necessarily \nsomething resistant, something that opposes the drive as such. For insofar \nas it is driving from a particular viewpoint toward the whole universe in \neach case, there are many things that the drive is not. The drive is modified \nby the viewpoint. We must heed the fact that drive as an active driving is \nrelated to resistance precisely because such drive can be the whole universe \npotentially but in fact is not. This passivity, in the sense of what the drive \ndoes not attain in its driving [erdriingt], belongs to the finitude of drive. \nThis negative aspect, purely as a sttuctural moment of finite drive, char\u00ad\nacterizes the nature of what Leibniz understands by materia prima. He \nwrites to des Bosses: \nMateria prima cuilibet Entelechiae est essentialis, neque unquam ab ea separatur, \ncum earn compleat et sit ipsa potentia passiva totius substantiae completae. Neque \nenim materia prima in mole seu impenetrabilitate et extensione consistit . . .  \n[Prime matter is essential for any entelechy, nor can it ever be separated from it \nsince it completes the entelechy and is the passive power itself of the total complete \nsubstance. For prime matter does not consist in mass nor in impenetrability and \nextension . . .  ] (G. ll, 314) \nBecause of this essential primordial passivity, the monad has the intrin\u00ad\nsic possibility of nerus with materia secunda, i.e., with massa, with definite \nresistance in the sense of material mass and weight. (Cf. on this Leibniz's \ncorrespondence with the mathematician Bernoulli and with the Jesuit des \nBosses, professor of philosophy and theology at the Jesuit college in Hil\u00ad\ndesheim.) \nThis structural moment of passivity provides Leibniz with the founda\u00ad\ntion for making metaphysically intelligible the nerus of the monad with a \nmaterial body (materia secunda, massa) and for demonstrating positively why \nextensio cannot constitute the essence of material substance as Descartes had \ntaught. We cannot pursue this here, however, nor can we go into the further \ndevelopment of the monadology or the metaphysical principles connected \nwith it. \n8 1  \n"

IfDasein can adopt a stance toward beings only by holding \nitself out into the nothing and can exist only thus, and if the nothing is \noriginally manifest only in anxiety, then must we not hover in this anxiety \nconstantly in order to be able to exist at all? And have we not ourselves \nconfessed that this original anxiety is rare? But above all else, we all do \nexist and comport ourselves toward beings [ 1 3] that we may or may not \nbe - without this anxiety. Is this not an arbitrary invention and the nothing \nattributed to it a flight of fancy? \nYet what does it mean that this original anxiety occurs only in rare mo\u00ad\nments?

Indeed, here for the first time the barrenness and range of nega\u00ad\ntion betray themselves. The saturation of Dasein by nihilative comport\u00ad\nment testifies to the constant though doubdessly obscured manifestation of \nthe nothing that only anxiety originally unveils. But this implies that the \noriginary anxiety in Dasein is usually repressed. Anxiety is there. It is only \nsleeping. Its breath quivers perpetually through Dasein, only slighdy in \nwhat makes us \"jittery,\" imperceptibly in the \"Oh, yes\" and the \"Oh, no\" \nof men of affairs; but most readily in the reserved, and most assuredly in \nthose who are basically daring. But those daring ones are sustained by that \non which they expend themselves - in order thus to preserve the ultimate \ngrandeur of Dasein. \n[I 5] The anxiety of those who are daring cannot be opposed to joy or \neven to the comfortable enjoyment of tranquilized busde. It stands - out\u00ad\nside all such opposition - in secret alliance with the cheerfulness and gende\u00ad\nness of creative longing. \nOriginary anxiety can awaken in Dasein at any moment.

So abyssally does the process of finitude \nentrench itself in Dasein that our most proper and deepest finitude refuses \nto yield to our freedom. \nBeing held out into the nothing - as Dasein is - on the ground of con\u00ad\ncealed anxiety is its surpassing of beings as a whole.

Although in discussions of the proposition the \nnothing itself never becomes a problem in its own right, the respective views \nof the nothing nevertheless express the guiding fundamental conception of \nbeings. Ancient metaphysics conceives the nothing in the sense of non be\u00ad\ning, that is, unformed matter, matter that cannot take form as an in-formed \nbeing that would offer an outward aspect (\u00a3l8oc;). To be in being is to be \na self-forming form that exhibits itself as such in an image (as something \nenvisaged). The origins, legitimacy, and limits of this conception of being \nare as little discussed as the nothing itself. On the other hand, Christian \ndogma denies the truth of the proposition ex nihilo nihil fit and thereby be\u00ad\nstows on the nothing a transformed significance, the sense of the complete \nabsence of beings apart from God: ex nih i/o fit - ens creatum [From nothing \ncomes - created being]. Now the nothing becomes the counterconcept to \nthat which properly is, the stmmtum ens, God as ens increatum. Here too \nthe interpretation of the nothing indicates the fundamental conception of \nbeings. But the metaphysical discussion of beings stays on the same level \nas the question of the nothing. The questions of being and of the nothing \nas such are not posed. Therefore no one is bothered by the difficulty that \nif God creates out of nothing precisely he must be able to comport himself \nto the nothing. But if God is God, he cannot know the nothing, assuming \nthat the \"Absolute\" excludes all nothingness. \nThis cursory historical recollection shows the nothing as the counter\u00ad\nconcept to that which properly is, i.e., as its negation. But if the nothing \nsomehow does become a problem, then this opposition does not merely un\u00ad\ndergo a somewhat clearer determination; rather, it awakens for the first time \nthe proper formulation of the metaphysical question concerning the being \nof beings. The nothing does not remain [17] the indeterminate opposite \nof beings but unveils itself as belonging to the being of beings. \n\"Pure Being and pure Nothing are therefore the same.\" This proposition \nof Hegel's (Science of Logic, Book I: Werke, vol. III, p. 74) is correct. Being \nand the nothing do belong together, not because both - from the point of \nview of the Hegelian concept of thought - agree in their indeterminateness \n94 \n"

The \"principle of reason\" [\"Satz vom \nGn'mde j5 was treated for the first time in a monograph by Christian A. \nCrusius in his Philosophical Dissertation concerning the Use and Limits of the \nPrinciple of Determinative and Commonly Sufficient Reason ( 1 74 3), 6 and finally \nby Schopenhauer [2 3] in his dissertation Concerning the Fomfold Root of the \nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason (181 3).7 Yet if the problem of ground is in gen\u00ad\neral bound up with the central questions of metaphysics, then it must also \nbe at iss\\A even where it is not dealt with explicitly in its familiar form. \nThus Kant apparently showed little interest in the \"principle of reason,\" \neven though he explicitly discusses it both at the beginning' and toward the \nend9 of his philosophizing. And yet it stands at the center of his Critique \nof Pure Reason. 10 Of no lesser significance for the problem are Schelling's \nPhilosophical Investigations c011Cerning the Esence of Human Freedom and Re\u00ad\nlated Matters (1809).11 The very reference to Kant and Schelling makes it \nquestionable as to whether the problem of ground is equivalent to that of \nthe \"principle of reason\" and whether it is even raised at all in that prin\u00ad\nciple. If not, then the problem of ground must first be awakened. This, \nhowever, does not exclude the possibility that a discussion of the \"princi\u00ad\nple of reason\" might give rise to such an awakening and provide an initial \npointer. The exposition of the problem, however, is equivalent to attain\u00ad\ning and designating the distinctive J()1tlin within which we may treat of \nthe essence of ground without any claim to make visible that essence at a \nstroke. This domain is shown to be transcendence. This means at the same \ntime that transcendence itself is first determined more originarily and more \ncomprehensively via the problem of ground. \u00d4Any illumination of essence \nthat is a philosophizing one, i.e., an intrinsicaffY finite endeavor, must also \nnecessarily always testify to that nonessencr that drives human knowledge \nin its entire essence.J Accordingly, the structure of what follows is stipu\u00ad\nlated: I.

And precisely in undertak\u00ad\ning this he considers it necessary to point out that the apparent self-evidence \nof concepts such as \"truth\" and \"identity\" forestalls any clarification of them \nthat would suffice to demonstrate the origin of the principium rationis and \nthe other axioms. \\Vhat is at issue in the present inquiry, however, is not \nthe derivation of the principium rationis, but an analysis of the problem of \nground. To what extent does this passage from Leibniz provide us with a \nguideline? \nThe principium rationis persists, because without its persistence there \nwould be beings that would have to be without ground. For Leibniz this \nmeans: There would be true things that would resist being resolved into \nidentities, there would be truths that would contravene the \"nature\" of \ntruth in general. Since this is impossible, however, and truth persists, the \nprincipium ration is, since it springs from the essence of truth, also persists. \nThe essence of truth, however, is to be found in the connexio (o\u2022J!Jli:Aoxf,) \nof subject and predicate. Leibniz thus conceives of truth from the outset \u00ad\nexplicitly, though not entirely legitimately, appealing to Aristotle - as truth \nof assertion (proposition). He determines the nexus as the \"inesse\" of P in \nS, and the \"inesse\" as \"idem esse.\" Identity as the essence of propositional \ntruth here evidently does not mean the empty sameness of something with \nitself, but unity in the sense of the original unitary agreement of that which \nbelongs together. [27] Truth thus means a unitary accord [Einstimmigkeit], \nwhich for its part can be such only as an overarching accordance [ Vber\u00ad\neinstimmung] with whatever is announced as unitary in the identity. In \n. keeping with their nature, \"truths\" - true assertions - assume a relation to \n, something on whose grounds they are able to be in accord. That linking which \nis a taking apart within every truth in each case always is what it is on the \ngrounds of. . .  , that is, as self-\"grounding.\" In its very essence, truth thus \nhouses a relation to something like \"ground.\" In that case, however, the \nproblem of truth necessarily brings us into a \"proximity\" to the problem \nof ground. Therefore the more originarily we master the essence of truth, \nthe more pressing the problem of ground must become. \nHowever, can anything more originary be brought to bear beyond the \ndelimitation of the essence of truth as a characteristic of the assertion? \n102 \n"

This entails, \nhowever, that our conception of the concept of world is dependent upon \nan understanding of the essence and possibility of proofs of God. This \nbecomes especially clear in Christian A. Crusius, who defines the concept \nof a world thus: \"a world means that kind of real association of finite things \nthat is not itself in turn part of another one to which it would belong by \nmeans of a real association.\"l\u2022 World is accordingly set over and against \nGod himself.

What must be clarified is: (I) To what does the \ntotality represented under the title \"world\" relate, and to what alone can \nit relate? (2) What is accordingly represented in the concept of world? (3) \nWhat chorocter does this represmting of such totality have; i.e., what is the \nconceptual structure of the concept of world as such?

Kant's concept of world \nindeed continues to relate the totality represented in it to finite things that \nare present at hand. However, this relation to finitude - a relation essential \nto the content of the concept of world - receives a new sense. The finitude \nof things present at hand is not determined by way of an antic demonstra\u00ad\ntion of their having been created by God, but is interpreted with regard \nto the fact that these things exist for a finite knowing, and with regard to \nthe extent to which they are possible objects for such knowing, i.e., for \na knowing that must first of all let them be givm to it as things that are \nalready present at hand.

The substantive content \nrepresented a priori in these \"synthetic\" principles, their \"reality\" in the \nold meaning - precisely retained by Kant - of substantiveness, may be pre\u00ad\nsented free of experience and by way of intuition from out of the objects, \ni.e., from out of that which is necessarily intuited a priori along with such \nobjects, namely, the pure intuition of \"time.\" The reality of the synthetic \nI 16 \n"

This will that essentially casts the \"for the sake of itself\" \nover and thereby before Dasein cannot therefore be a particular willing, an \n\"act of will\" as distinct from other forms of comportment (such as repre\u00ad\nsenting, judging, or enjoyment). All forms of comportment are rooted in \ntranscendence. The \"will\" in question, however, must first \"form\" the \"for\u00ad\nthe-sake-of\" itself as and in a surpassing. Yet whatever, in accordance with \nits essence, casts something like the \"for the sake of\" projectively before it, \n\u00b7rather than simply producing it as an occasional and additional accomplish\u00ad\nment, is that which we call freedum. Surpassing in the direction of world is \nfreedom itself. Accordingly, transcendence does not merely come upon the \n\"for the sake of\" as anything like a value or end that would be present at \nhand in itself; rather, freedom holds the \"for the sake of\" tuward itself, and \ndoes so as freedom. In this transcending that holds the \"for the sake of\" toward \nitself there occurs the Dasein in human beings,\u2022 such that in the essence \nof their existence they can be obligated to themselves, i.e., be free selves. \nIn this, however, freedom simultaneously unveils itself as making possible \n(6o) something binding, indeed obligation in general. Freedum alone can let \na world prevail and let it world for Dasein. World never is, but worlds. \nIn this interpretation of freedom arrived at in terms of transcendence \nthere ultimately lies a more originary characterization of the essence of \nfreedom than that which determines it as spontaneity, i.e., as a kind of \ncausality. The beginning of something by itself provides only the negative \ncharacterization of freedom according to which there is no determinative \ncause lying further back. This characterization, however, overlooks above \nall the fact that it speaks in an ontologically undifferentiated manner of \n\"beginnings\" and \"occurrences,\" without explicitly characterizing what it \nmeans to be a cause in terms of the specific manner of being pertaining to \nthe being that is in this way, namely, Dasein. Accordingly, if spontaneity \n(\"beginning by oneself\") is to be capable of serving as an essential charac\u00ad\nterization of the \"subject,\" then two things are first required: ( 1) Selfhood \nmust be clarified ontologically for any possible appropriate conception of \nwhat is meant by this \"by oneself\"; (2) precisely the same clarification of \nselfhood must provide us in advance with an indication of the way in which \n\u2022 First edition, 1929: The reverse: Dasein withstands the prevailing [Wa/un), or bener the \ne.o;sential unfolding [Wtsrn), of truth and thus grounds the possibility of being human as \nheing human in Dasein! \n1 26 \n"

As a consequence of this origin of grounding things \nand thus also of accounting for them, it is in each case left to the freedom \nin Dasein how far to extend such grounding [66) and whether indeed it un\u00ad\nderstands how to attain an authentic grounding of things, i.e., an unveiling \nof the transcendental possibility of such grounding. Even though being \nis always unveiled in transcendence, this does not require any conceptual \nontological grasp. Thus it is altogether possible for transcendence to re\u00ad\nmain concealed as such and be familiar only in an \"indirect\" interpretation. \nYet even then it is unveiled, because it lets there be precisely beings that \nhave irrupted with the fundamental constitution ofbeing-in-the-world, and \nin this the self-unveiling of transcendence makes itself known.

The occurrence of transcendence as grounding is the forming of \na leeway into which there can irrupt the factical self-maintaining of factical \nDasein in each case in the midst of beings as a whole. \nAre we then restricting to three the four grounds discovered by the tra\u00ad\ndition, or are these three ways of grounding equivalent to the three kinds \nof ;:pwwv oOe:v in Aristotle?

The origi\u00ad\nnary character of the transcendental grounds and their specific character of \nground remain covered over beneath the formal characterization of \"first\" \nand \"highest\" beginnings. And for this reason they also lack unity. Such \nunity can consist only in the equioriginary character of the transcendental \norigin of the threefold grounding.

In Leibniz we indeed find the principle coined in ways that lend \nexpression to an apparently insignificant moment of its content.

Here again \nthe first problem is not that of the ways and means by which these ques\u00ad\ntions, in each case posed facticaUy in ontic ways of comportment, are to \nbe decided. Rather, what needs to be clarified is why it is that the \"cur\" \n(\"why\"] could associate itself with the \"potius quam\" (\"rather than\"] at all. \nEvery accounting for things must move within a sphere of what is posible, \nbecause as-a manner of intentional comportment toward beings with re\u00ad\nspect to their possibility it is already compliant with the explicit or implicit \n(ontological) growtding of something.

Then resolute openness \nzum Gebeimnis] is un er way mto errancy as such. Then the question of \nthe essence of truth gets asked more originally. Then the ground of the \nintenwining of the essence of truth with the truth of essence reveals itself. \nThe glimpse into the mystery [94] out of errancy is a questioning - in the \nsense of that unique question of what beings as such are as a whole. This \nquestioning thinks the question of the Being of beings, a question that is \nessentially misleading and thus in its manifold meaning is still not mastered. \nThe thinking of Being, from which such questioning originarily stems, has \nsimultaneously __ _ \nconcealing \nbeings -asaw~In the s1mulwicity \n~cealing, err~ holds \ntoward_!he ~y\u2022ry [d_!__e_\u00a7t-:Sf.b_/ossenheit \n----~------\n"

ESSENCE OF TRUTH \nthat to be sure he could understand only on the basis of his fundamental \nmetaphysical position, founded on subjectivity, and which he had to under\u00ad\nstand as the keeping of its laws. This essential view of the determination of \nphilosophy nevertheless goes far enough to renounce every subjugation of \nphilosophical thinking, the most destirute kind of which lets philosophy still \nbe of value as an \"expression\" of \"culrure\" (Spengler) and as an ornament \nof productive humankind. \nHowever, whether philosophy as \"keeper of its laws\" fulfills the essence \noriginarily decided for it, or whether it is not itself first of all kept and \nappointed to its task as keeper by the truth of that to which its laws in each \ncase pertain - this depends on the primordiality with which the original \nessence of truth becom_es essential for thoughtful questioning. \nThe present undertaking takes the question of the essence of truth be\u00ad\nyond the confines of the ordinary definition provided in the usual concept \nof essence and helps us to [96] consider whether the question of the essence \nof truth must not be, at the same time and even first of all, the question \nconcerning the truth of essence. But in the concept of \"essence\" philos\u00ad\nophy thinks Being. In tracing the inner possibility of the correctness of \nstatements back to the ek-sistent freedom of letting-be as its \"ground,\" \nand likewise in pointing to the essential begining of this ground in con\u00ad\ncealing and in errancy, we want to show that the essence of truth is not \nthe empty \"generality\" of an \"abstract\" universality but rather that which, \nself-concealing, is unique in the unremitting history of the disclosure of \nthe \"meaning\" of what we call Being - what we for a long time have been \naccustomed to considering only as beings as a whole. \n9\u00b7 NOTE \nThe question of the essence of truth arises from the question of the truth \nof essence. In the former question essence is understood initially in the \nsense of whatness (quidditns) or material content (realitos), whereas truth is \nunderstood as a characteristic of knowledge. In the question of the truth of \nessence, essence is understood verbally; in this word, remaining still within \nmetaphysical presentation, Beyng is thought as the difference that holds \nsway between Being and beings. Truth signifies sheltering that clears [licht\u00ad\nmdes Bergen) as the fundamental trait of Being. The question of the essence \nof truth finds its answer in the proposition the essmce of truth is the truth of \nessmce. After our explanation it can easily be seen that the proposition does \nnot merely reverse the word order so as to conjure the specter of paradox. \nThe subject of the proposition - if this unforrunate grammatical category \n153 \n"

But the \"doctrine\" of a thinker is that which, within \nwhat is said, remains unsaid, that to which we are exposed so that we might \nexpend ourselves on it. \nIn order to experience and to know for the future what a thinker left \nunsaid, whatever that might be, we have to consider what he said. To prop\u00ad\nerly satisfy this demand would entail examining all of Plato's \"dialogues\" \nin their interrelationship. Since this is impossible, we must let a different \npath guide us to the unsaid in Plato's thinking. \n\\Vhat remains unsaid in Plato's thinking is a change in what determines \nthe essence of truth. The fact that this change does take place, what it \nconsists in, and what gets grounded through this transformation of the \nessence of truth - all of that can be clarified by an interpretation of the \n\"allegory of the cave.\" \nThe \"allegory of the cave\" is presented at the beginning of the seventh \nbook of the \"dialogue\" on the essence of the r.6i-.u; (Republic, VI, 5 14 a2 to \n5 1 7  a7). The \"allegory\" tells a story. The tale unfolds in the conversation \nbetween Socrates and Glaucon. Socrates presents the story, Glaucon shows \nhis awakening astonishment. The translation that we provide for the text \nincludes phrases that go beyond the Greek in an effort to elucidate it; these \nwe have put in parentheses.2 \n1 55 \n,t, \n"

Whatever has been unbidden to human \nbeings at any given time, as well as the manner of its unhiddenness, has to \nbe transformed. In Greek, unhiddenness is called a/..<9t\u0004a. a word that we \ntranslate as \"truth.\" And for a long time now in Western thinking, truth \nhas meant the agreement of the representation in thought with the thing \nitself: adaequatio intellectus et rei. \nBut if we are not satisfied with simply translating the words 1ta\u01078\u00a3la \nand a/..<Ot\u0108a \"literally,\" if instead we attempt [125] to think through the \nissue according to the Greek way of knowing and to ponder the essential \nmatter that is at stake in these translations, then straightaway \"education\" \nand \"truth\" come together into an essential unity. If we take seriously the \nessential content of what the word aJ.l)9t\u0004a names, then we must ask: From \nwhat perspective does Plato approach his detennination of the essence of \nunhiddenness? For the answer to this question we are referred to the proper \ncontent of the \"allegory of the cave.\" The answer will show both the fact \nthat and the way in which the \"allegory\" deals with the essence of truth. \nThe unbidden and its unhiddenness designate at each point what is \npresent and manifest in the region where human beings happen to dwell. \nBut the \"allegory\" recounts a story of passages from one dwelling place to \nanother. Thus this story is divided in a general way into a series of four \ndifferent dwelling places in specific gradations of up and down. The dis\u00ad\ntinctions between the dwelling places and stages within the movement of \npassage are grounded in the different kinds of liA\"fl9tc; nonnative at each \nlevel, that is, the different kinds of\"truth\" that are dominant at each stage. \nFor that reason, in one way or another we have to think out and designate \nwhat the liA\"fl9tc;, the unbidden, is at each stage. \nIn stage one, people live chained inside the cave, engrossed in what \nthey immediately encounter. The description of this dwelling place ends \nwith the emphatic sentence: lta\\l'taltao\u0004 8\u001e . . .  oL \"tOWG\"tm o\u2022)x &\" &J.A.o n \n\\IOf!LCo\u0004\u00a3\\1 1:0 &J.ljOtc; Yj 1:ac; \"tW\\1 oxt\u2022JaO\"\"tW\\1 ox\u0004ac; (5 I 5 ci-1). \"In no way, \nthen, would those who are chained like this ever consider anything else to \nbe the unbidden except the shadows cast by the artifacts.\" \nStage two tells about the removal of the chains.

Authentic liberation \nis the steadiness of being oriented toward that which appears in its visible \nform and which is the most unhidden in this appearing. Freedom exists \nonly as the orientation that is structured in this way.

Hence the telling of the story \ndoes not end, as is often supposed, with the description of the highest level \nattained in the ascent out of the cave. On the contrary, the \"allegory\" in\u00ad\ncludes the story of the descent of the freed person back into the cave, back \nto those who are still in chains. The one who has been freed is supposed \nto lead these people too away from what is unhidden for them and to bring \nthem face to face with the most unbidden. But the would-be liberator no \nlonger knows his or her way around the cave and risks the danger of suc\u00ad\ncumbing to the overwhelming power of the kind of truth that is normative \nthere, the danger of being overcome by the claim of the common \"reality\" \n[1 29] to be the only reality. The liberator is threatened with the possibil\u00ad\nity of being put to death, a possibility that became a reality in the fate of \nSocrates, who was Plato's \"teacher.\" \nThe return to the cave and the battle waged within the cave between the \nliberator and the prisoners who resist all liberation, of itself makes up stage \nfour of the \"allegory,\" where the story comes to a conclusion. Admittedly \nthe word ai-r.O\u051dc; is no longer used in this part of the story. Nonetheless this \nstage also has to deal with the unbidden that conditions the area of the cave \nthat the freed person now visits once again. But was not the \"unhidden\" \nthat is normative in the cave - the shadows - already mentioned in stage \none? Yes, it was. But two factors are essential to the unbidden: not only \ndoes it in some way or other render accessible whatever appears and keep \nit revealed in its appearing, but it also constantly overcomes a hiddenness \nof the hidden. The unbidden must be tom away from a hiddenness; it \nmust in a sense be stolen from hiddenness. Originally for the Greeks\u2022 \nhiddenness, as an act of self-hiding, permeated the essence of being and \nthus also determined beings in their presentness and accessibility (\"truth\"); \nand that is why the Greek word for what the Romans call \"veritas\" and for \nwhat we call \"truth\" was distinguished by the alpha-privative (a-/..f,OEL::t). \nTruthb originally means what has been wrested from hiddenness.c Truth is \nthus a wresting away in each case, in the form of a revealing. The hiddenness \ncan be of various kinds: closing off, hiding away, disguising, covering over, \nmasking, dissembling. Since, according to Plato's \"allegory,\" the supremely \nunbidden must be wrested from a base and stubborn hiding, for this reason \none's movement out of the cave into the open and into the light of day is \n3 Of\u0525lrint from G.-istCv;r 0/lrr/irfrmng, 19_.z : l leraclitus, fragment l l  J. \nh Offprint from Gri.rtigt Vbrrlirftnmg, 1 9_.z : In the sense of that which is true. \n<.

The visible form \nprovides a view of that as which any given being is present. The reflection \nproper aims at the i8tct. The \"idea\" is the visible fonn that offers a view of \nwhat is present. The i8tct is pure shining in the sense of the phrase \"the sun \nshines.\" The \"idea\" does not first let something else {behind it) \"shine in its \nappearance\" [\"er.rcheinenj; it itself is what shines, it is concerned only with \nthe shining of itself. The t8tct is that which can shine [das Scheinsame]. The \nessence of the idea consists in its ability to shine and be seen [Schein- und \nSichtsamkeit]. This is what brings about presencing, specifically the coming \nto presence of what a being is in any given instance. A being becomes \npresent in each case in its whatness. But after all, coming to presence is the \nessence of being. That is why for Plato the proper essence of being consists \nin whatness. Even later terminology shows this: quiditas, and not existentia, \nis true ese, i.e., essentia. 'What the idea, in its shining forth, brings into view \nand thereby lets us see is - for the gaze focused on that idea - the unhidden \nof that as which the idea appears. This unbidden is grasped antecedently \nand by itself as that which is apprehended in apprehending the i8tct, as \nthat which is known (y\fyv(a)GXOf.1Evov) in the act of knowing (yHyv\u0159axE\u0202v). \nOnly in this Platonic revolution do vot\u01d9v and vovc; (apprehending) first get \nreferred essentially to the \"idea.\" The adoption of this orientation to the \nideas henceforth determines the essence of apprehension [ Vm2ehmung] and \nsubsequently the essence of\"reason\" (\"Vernunftj. \n[1p] \"Unhiddenness\" now means: the unbidden always as what is ac\u00ad\ncessible thanks to the idea's ability to shine. But insofar as the access is \nnecessarily carried out through \"seeing,\" unhiddenness is yoked into a \"re\u00ad\nlation\" with seeing, it becomes \"relative\" to seeing. Thus toward the end of \nBook VI of the Republic Plato develops the question: 'What makes the thing \nseen and the act of seeing be what they are in their relation? What spans the \nspace between them? 'What yoke (C,Jyov, soS a1) holds the two together? \nThe \"allegory of the cave\" was written in order to illustrate the answer, \nwhich is set forth in an image: The sun as source of light lends visibility to \nwhatever is seen. But seeing sees what is visible only insofar as the eye is \ni;AwEH8tc;, \"sunlike\" by having the power to participate in the sun's kind of \nessence, that is, its shining. The eye itself \"emits light\" and devotes itself \nto the shining and in this way is able to receive and apprehend whatever \nappears.

However, insofar as he understands value \nas the condition of the possibility of\"life,\" a condition posited by \"life itself,\" \nNietzsche has held on to the essence of aya66v with much less prejudice \nthan those who go chasing after the absurdity of \"intrinsically valid values.\" \nMoreover if we follow modem philosophy and think the essence of the \n\"idea\" as perceptio (\"subjective representation\"), then we find in the \"idea \nof the good\" a \"value\" present somewhere in itself, of which in addition \nwe have an \"idea.\" This \"idea\" must naturally be the highest because what \nmatters is that everything run its course in the \"good\" (in the well-being of \nprosperity or in the orderliness of an order). Within this modem way of \nthinking there is absolutely nothing more to grasp of the original essence \nof Plato's tSta 'tOG aya6ol). \nIn Greek thought tb aya66v means that which is capable of something \nand enables another to be capable of something.

The same ambiguity in the detennination of the essence of truth still \nprevails in Aristotle as well. In the closing chapter of Book IX of the Meta\u00ad\nphysics (Metaphysics f-), 10, 1051 a34ff.) where Aristotelian thinking on the \nbeing of beings reaches its peak, unhiddenness is the all-controlling fun\u00ad\ndamental trait of beings.

From now on this characterization of the essence \nof truth as the correcmess of both representation and assertion becomes \nnormative for the whole of Western thinking. As evidence of that, let it \nsuffice to cite the guiding theses that typify the characterizations of the \nessence of truth in the main epochs of metaphysics. \nFor medieval Scholasticism, Thomas Aquinas's thesis holds good: veri\u00ad\nrae proprie invenitur in intellectu humano vel divino (Quaestiones de Veritate, \nquaestio I, articulus 4\u2022 responsio): \"Truth is properly encountered in the \nhuman or in the divine intellect.\" The intellect is where truth has its essen\u00ad\ntial locus.

Nietzsche's concept of truth displays the last glimmer of the \nmost extreme consequence of the change of truth from the unhiddenness \nof beings to the correcmess of the gaze.

Natura \nmeans \"that which lets something originate from itself.\" \nSince those times \"nature\" has become the fundamental word that des\u00ad\nignates essential relations that Western historical humanity has to beings, \nboth to itself and to beings other than itself. This fact is shown by a rough \nlist of dichotomies that have become prevalent: nature and grace (i.e., \nsuper-nature), nature and art, nature and history, nature and spirit. But we \nlikewise speak of the \"nature\" of spirit, the \"nature\" of history, and the \"na\u00ad\nture\" of the human being. By this last phrase we mean not just one's body \nor even the species \"human,\" but one's whole essence.

On the one hand apxf, \nmeans that from which something has its origin and begining; on the other \nhand it means that which, as this origin and begining, likewise keeps rein \nover, i.e., restrains and therefore dominates, something else that emerges \nfrom it. \n\u00b7 Apx+, means, at one and the same time, beginning and control. \nOn a broader and therefore lower scale we can say: origin and ordering. In \norder to express the unity that oscillates between the two, we can translate \nripxf, as originating ordering and as ordering origin. The unity of these \ntwo is essential. And this concept of apx\u01b1 gives a more definite content \nto the word cthLOv (cause) used above.

Plants and animals are in movedness even when they \nstand still and rest. Rest is a kind of movement; only that which is able \nto move can rest. It is absurd to speak of the number 3 as \"resting.\" Be\u00ad\ncause plants and animals are in movement regardless of whether they rest or \nmove, for this reason not only are they in movement; they are in movedness. \nThis means: they are not, in the first instance, beings for themselves and \namong others, beings that then occasionally happen to slip into states of \nmovement.

This is why Kant has to \"de\u00ad\nrive\" the table of categories from the table of judgments. Thus, knowledge \nof categories as determinations of the being of beings - what people call \nmetaphysics - is, in an essential sense, knowledge of /.oyoc:; - i.e., \"logic. \" \nTherefore, metaphysics receives this name at the stage where it comes to \nthe full (as full as is possible for it) consciousness of itself, in Hegel. [The \nScience of Logic is absolute knowledge of the knowable as something known \nor represented. (In modern philosophy, the state of being represented is \nbeingness or being.)] \nIn the text we are considering, Xll'tljyop(a is used in a preterminological \nsense. Inasmuch as we consider something produced - e.g., a bedstead \u00ad\nwithin the horizon opened up by the everyday way of addressing and nam\u00ad\ning, we take such a being according to its appearance as something of use. \nIn this capacity it does not have the lipx\u019d xwr]ae:wc:; in itself. But we can \nconsider it from a second perspective: we can take this very same being, the \nbedstead, as something made out of wood, hence as a piece of wood. As \nwood, it is part of a tree trunk, a growing thing. This tree has the &pxt, \nxw\u019eae:wc:; in itself. The bedstead, on the other hand, is not wood as such, \nbut merely wooden, made out of wood. Only what is something other than \nwood can be wooden. This is why we never call a tree trunk wooden, but we \ndo say a person's bearing is \"wooden,\" and in German one can say an apple \nis \"wooden.\" \\Vhat the bedstead is when taken according to the xatr,yop(a, \nnamely, a usable thing that looks thus and so, has no absolutely necessary \nrelation to wood.

In fact, up until now we do not even know what kind of \nreflection and inquiry is already at work when we ask about 'fl'JaLc; as we have \nbeen doing. And these things Aristotle tells us only now in the passage we \nhave just read, a text that establishes with extreme succincmess the horizon \nwithin which the discussion moves, both the preceding part and especially \nwhat is to follow. \nThe decisive sentence reads: xat lan ltlivta taut a oua(a, \"and all these -\nnamely, t.pua\u00a3L-beings - have being of the type called beingnes.\" This ex\u00ad\npression \"beingness,\" [330] which hardly strikes the ear as elegant, is the \nonly adequate translation for oua(a.

The word o6ala was not originally a \nphilosophical \"term\" any more than was the word xat'lyop(a, which we have \nalready explained. The word o\u2022)o(a was first coined as a technical \"term\" \nby Aristode. This coining consists in the fact that Aristode thoughtfully \ndraws out of the content of the word a crucial element and then holds on \nto it firmly and clearly. Nonetheless, at the time of Aristode and even later, \nthe word still retained its ordinary meaning, whereby it signified house \nand home, holdings, financial means; we might also say \"present assets,\" \n\"property,\" what lies present. We must think in terms of this meaning if we \nwant to get at the naming power of o\u2022)a(a as a basic philosophical word. \nAnd then right away we also see how simple and obvious is the explanation \nAristode provides for the word ot)akz in the text above: t);.ox\u00a3L!l\u00a3vov yap \nn x:tt E:v \u2022)r.oXELfltv\u0517 E:att v \u0175 '?'JIJL<; :i\u00a3L, \"for in each case rp\u2022)tJLc; is like a \nlying-present and 'in' a lying-present.\" One might object that our transla\u00ad\ntion here is \"wrong.\" Aristotle's sentence does not say \u2022)r.ox\u00a3io0cu yap n, \na \"lying-present\" [Vorliegen] but rather \"something that lies present\" [ein \nVorliegmdes]. But here we must pay strict attention to what the sentence \nis supposed to explain: namely, to what extent '?'JO\"Lc; is o\u2022io(a and thus has \nthe character of beingness (being).

What we mean here is not mere \npresence (Vorhandenheit], and certainly not something that is exhausted \nmerely in stability; rather: presencing, in the sense of coming forth into the \nunbidden, placing itself into the open. One does not get at the meaning of \npresencing by referring to mere duration. \n(4) But the interpretation of rp\u2022)aLc; given by Antiphon and the others \nunderstands the being of the r.p(,a\u00a3L 3vtll via a reference to \"beings\" (the \n\"elemental\").

There\u00ad\nfore, in what follows when we speak simply of\"appearance,\" we always have \nin mind the appearance as (and insofar as) it puts itself fonh into a given \nthing that is \"there for a while\" (for example, the \"appearance\" \"table\" \nthat puts itself fonh into this table here). We call an individual thing das \nJweilige, \"that which is there for a while,\" because as an individual thing \nit \"stays for a while\" in its appearance and preserves the \"while\" (the pres\u00ad\nencing) of this appearance, and, by preserving the appearance, stands fonh \nin it and out of it - which means that it \"is\" in the Greek sense of the word. \nBy translating tJoprpf, as placing into the appearance, we mean to express \ninitially two things that are of equal importance to the sense of the Greek \nterm but that are thoroughly lacking in our word \"form.\" First, placing \ninto the appearance is a mode of presencing, o,:Jata.

Of course, the placing and the appearance do not \nstand off by themselves; rather, it is only in a given being that they can be pointed \nout by addressing them.

Much more important is \nthe emphasis given to the crucial thought that tp(\u2022o`c;, spoken of in two ways, \nis not a being but a manner of being. Therefore, Aristotle again presses home \nthe point: the appearance and the placing into the appearance must not be \ntaken Platonically as standing apart unto themselves, but as the being [Sein] \nin which an individual being stands at any given moment - for example, \nthis person here. To be sure, this individual being is from UA'IJ and !JOptpf;, \nbut precisely for this reason it is a being and not a way of being - not tpvo`c;, \nas are !JOptpf; and OAlJ in their inherent togetherness.

Such being can \nbe understood only if we use Myoc; as our clue. But addressing things shows \nthat the appearance and the placedness into the appearance are primary, and \nfrom them what we call OAlJ is then determined as the orderable. But with \nthat, yet another issue already gets decided, but one that prompts the next \nstep in the demonstration that tpuo`c; is !JOptpf;.

Earlier still it was established that 'P'JOEL ovtCI are XLVO'J!lEVCI: their \nbeing is movedness. \nWe now have to grasp movedness as ol)o(CI; i.e., we must say what moved\u00ad\nness is.

It would be pre\u00ad\nsumptuous to try to capture in a few sentences an essential insight into \nAristotle's interpretation of movedness, the most difficult thing Western \nmetaphysics has had to ponder in the course of its history.

The reason for the difficulty in Aristotle's \ndefinition of the essence [of movedness1 lies in the strange simplicity of the \nessential insight. It is a simplicity we seldom achieve because even now we \nhardly have an inkling of the Greek concept of being, and likewise, in re\u00ad\nflecting on the Greek experience of movedness, we forget what is decisive, \nnamely, that the Greeks conceive of movedness in terms of rest. [3541 At \nthis point we must distinguish between movedness and movement, as well \nas between rest and repose. Movedness means the essence from which both \nmovement and rest are determined. Rest is then the \"cessation\" (r.CI'JEO'aCIL, \nMetaphysics 0 6, 1048 bz6) of movement. The lack of movement can be cal\u00ad\nculated as its limit-case (= o).

ESSENCE AND CONCEPT OF 4>\u2022jm.; \ndifference between the generation of a human being and the generation \nof a table forces us into some crucial reflections in which we will have to \nclarify what role is assigned to the contrast of growing things with artifacts \nthat has been operative from the very beginning of the chapter and has run \nthrough the whole explanation. \n\\Vhen Aristotle time and again characterizes growing things by way of \nanalogy with artifacts, does this mean he already understands the rp\u2022)oe:L \no11'til as self-making artifacts? No, quite the contrary, he conceives of rp\u2022)oLc; \nas self-production. But is not \"production\" the same as \"making\"? It is \nfor us so long as we wander thoughtlessly among worn-out ideas instead \nof holding on to what was already pointed out. But what if we should find \nour way back to the realm of being as understood by the Greeks? Then we \nsee that making, \u0511o(lJoLc;, is one kind of production, whereas \"growing\" (the \ngoing back into itself and emerging out of itself), rpuoLc;, is another. Here \"to \npro-duce\" cannot mean \"to make\" but rather: to place something into the \nunhiddenness of its appearance; to let something become present; presenc\u00ad\ning. From this notion of pro-duction the essence of generation [Ent-stehen] \nand of its various kinds may be determined. Instead of \"generation\" we \nshould have to say \"derivation\" [Ent-steOung], which is not to be taken in its \nusual sense but rather as meaning: to derive from one appearance that ap\u00ad\npearance into which something pro-duced (in any given instance) is placed \nand thus is. Now there are different kinds of such \"derivation.\" Something \ngenerated (say, a table) can be derived from one appearance (the appearance \nof \"table\") and placed forth into the same kind of appearance without the \nfirst appearance, from which [36o] the table is derived, itself performing the \nplacing into the appearance. The first appearance (e:l8oc;), \"table,\" remains \nonly a \u0512ilpa8e:LY!.lil, something that certainly shows up in the production but \ndoes nothing more than that and therefore requires something else that can \nfirst place the orderable wood, as something appropriate for appearing as \na table, into that appearance. In those cases where the appearance merely \nshows up, and in showing up only guides a !mow-how in the producing \nof it and plays an accompanying role rather than actually peifurming the \nproduction - there production is a making. \nThis way of showing up is cenainly one kind of presencing, but it is not \nthe only kind. It is also possible that an appearance - without showing up \nspecifically as a ;;CLpa8e:LY!.lil, namely, in and for a 'tEX\"\"'i - can directly present \nitself as what takes over the placing into itself. The appearance places itself \nforth. Here we have the placing of an appearance. And in thus placing itself \nforth it places itself into itself; i.e., it itself produces something with its kind \nof appearance. This is !.loprpf, as rp\u2022)mc;.

But what is yet to be determined is the \"whereunto\" of the process, \nor better, the meaning of 6S6c; that results from the determination of the \n\"whereunto.\" \n[362) 4\u00bbuoLc; is Moe; tx q,)cm&c; e:ic; (j)'JOLv, the being-on-the-way of a \nself-placing thing toward itself as what is to be pro-duced, and this in such \na way that the self-placing is itself whoUy of a kind with the self-placing \nthing to be pro-duced. What could be more obvious than the opinion that \nrp,)oLc; is therefore a kind of self-making, hence a ttxvl), the only difference \nbeing that the end of this making has the character of quaLc;? And we do \nknow of such a ttxv'l. 'latpLX\u0017, the art of medicine, has its \noc; as OyLELa, \na rpuaLc;-like condition. 'latpLx\u0017 is oSoc; de; quaLv. But just when the road \nseems open to an analogy between quaLc; and iatpLx\u0017, the basic difference \nbetween the two ways of generating a quaEL /)v comes to light. 'latpLX\u0017, as \nMoe; de; quaLv, is a being-on-the-way toward something that precisely is not \niatpLx\u0017, not the art of medicine itself, i.e., not a ttxvl). 'latpLX\u0017 would have \nto be 6,oc; Elc; latpLx-y in order to be at aU analogous to tpU(7Lc;. But if it \nwere, it would no longer be latpLX\u0017, because practicing medicine has as its \nend the state of health and this alone. Even if a doctor practices medicine in \norder to attain a higher degree of the ttxvl), he or she does so only in order \nall the more to reach the ttA.oc; of restoring health - provided, of course, \nthat we are talking about a real doctor and not a medical \"entrepreneur\" or \n\"time-server.\" \nThe renewed attempt to clarify the essence of (j)'JOLc; by way of an analogy \nwith ttxv'l fails precisely here from every conceivable point of view. This means: \nwe must understand the essence of rp,)aLc; entirely from out of itself, and we \nshould not detract from the astonishing fact of 'fi'JaLc; as Moe; rpuaEwc; Eic; \n'P'JOLV by overhasty analogies and explanations. \nBut even when we give up pressing the analogy to ttxvl), one last tempt\u00ad\ning \"explanation\" now urges itself upon US. As (j)lJOEWc; 08oc; Eic; 'fiUOLV, is \nnot 'P'JO\"Lc; a constant circling back upon itself? However, this is precisely \nwhat is not the case. As on the way to rpuGLc;, rp,)aLc; does not fall back on \nwhatever it comes forth from. What is generated never places itself back \ninto what it comes from, [363) precisely because the essence of generation \nis the self-placing into the appearance. If such placing lets the self-placing \nappearance be present, and if the appearance is, in each case, present only \nin an individual \"this\" which has such an appearance, then to this extent, \n223 \n"

On the contrary, this meaning \nof the word can even bar the way to understanding the issue if, as always in \nsuch cases, we lack a prior familiarity with, and a knowledge of, the realm in \nwhich the word arises as a name for the issue at stake.

Along \nthe guidelines of a facile distinction between \"higher\" and \"lower\" these \n\"moods\" can then be classified as either uplifting or depressing. The zeal\u00ad\nous pursuit of \"types\" and \"countertypes\" of\"feelings\" and of varieties and \nsubspecies of these \"types\" will never run out of prey.

So as to indicate that \"logic\" is only one interpretation of \nthe essence of thinking, indeed the one that, as its very name shows, rests \nupon the experience of being attained in Greek thought. The suspicion \nregarding \"logic,\" whose consequential development degenerates into lo\u00ad\ngistics, springs from a knowledge belonging to that thinking which finds its \nsource in the experience of the truth of being, but not in contemplating the \nobjectivity of beings. Exact thinking is never the most rigorous thinking, if \nrigor indeed receives its essence from the kind of rigorous effort whereby \nknowledge in each case maintains itself within a relation to what is essential \nin beings. Exact thinking merely binds itself to the calculation of beings \nand serves this end exclusively. \nAl calculation lets what is countable be resolved into something count\u00ad\ned that can then be used for subsequent counting. Calculation refuses to \nlet anything appear except what is countable. Everything is only whatever \nit counts. \\Vhat has been counted in each instance secures the continu\u00ad\nation of counting. Such counting progressively consumes numbers, and \nis itself a continual self-consumption. The calculative process of resolv\u00ad\ning beings into what has been counted counts as the explanation of their \nbeing. Calculation uses all beings in advance as that which is countable, \nand uses up what is counted for the purpose of counting. This use of be\u00ad\nings that consumes them betrays the consuming character of calculation. \nOnly because number can be infinitely multiplied, irrespective of whether \nthis occurs in the direction of the large or the small, can the consum\u00ad\ning essence of calculation hide behind its products and lend to calculative \nthinking the semblance of productivity - whereas already in its anticipa\u00ad\ntory grasping, and not primarily in its subsequent results, such thinking lets \nall beings count only in the form of what can be set at our disposal and \nconsumed. Calculative thinking compels itself into a compulsion to master \neverything on the basis of the consequential correctness of its procedure. It \nis unable to foresee that everything calculable by calculation - prior to the \nsum-totals and products that it produces by calculation in each case - is al\u00ad\nready a whole, a whole whose unity indeed [ 105] belongs to the incalculable \nthat withdraws itself and its uncanniness from the claws of calculation.

But in what does the humanity of the human being consist? \nIt lies in his essence. \nBut whence and how is the essence of the human being determined? \nMarx demands that \"the human being's humanity\" be recognized and ac\u00ad\nknowledged. He finds it in \"society.\" The \"social\" human is for him the \n\"natural\" human. In \"society\" human \"nature,\" that is, the totality of \"nat\u00ad\nural needs\" (food, clothing, reproduction, economic sufficiency), is equably \nsecured. The Christian sees the humanity of man, the humanitas of homo, \nin contradistinction to Deitas. He is the human being of the history of re\u00ad\ndemption who as a \"child of God\" hears and accepts the call of the Father \nin Christ. The human being is not of this world, since the \"world,\" thought \nin terms of Platonic theory, is only a temporary passage to the beyond. \nHumanitas, explicidy so called, was first considered and striven for in the \nage of the Roman Republic. Homo humanus was opposed to homo barbarus. \nHomo humanus here means the Romans, who exalted and honored Roman \nvirtus through the \"embodiment\" of the ltaLIIEta [education] taken over from \nthe Greeks. These were the Greeks of the Hellenistic age, whose culture \nwas acquired in the [ 1 52] schools of philosophy. It was concerned with \nenuiitio et institutio in bonas artes [scholarship and training in good conduct). \nIlaLIIEta thus understood was translated as humanitas. The genuine roman\u00ad\nitas of homo romanus consisted in such humanitas. We encounter the first \nhumanism in Rome: it therefore remains in essence a specifically Roman \nphenomenon, which emerges from the encounter of Roman civilization \nwith the culture of late Greek civilization. The so-called Renaissance of \nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Italy is a renascentia romanitatis. Be\u00ad\ncause romanitas is what matters, it is concerned with humanitas and therefore \nwith Greek r.clLIIE[a. But Greek civilization is always seen in its later form \nand this itself is seen from a Roman point of view. The homo romantiS of \nthe Renaissance also stands in opposition to homo barbarus. But now the \nin-humane is the supposed barbarism of Gothic Scholasticism in the Mid\u00ad\ndle Ages. Therefore a muJium humanitatis, which in a certain way reaches \nback to the ancients and thus also becomes a revival of Greek civiliza\u00ad\ntion, always adheres to historically understood humanism. For Germans \nthis is apparent in the humanism of the eighteenth century supported by \nWinckelmann, Goethe, and Schiller. On the other hand, Holderlin does \nnot belong to \"humanism,\" precisely because he thought the destiny of the \nessence of the human being in a more original way than \"humanism\" could. \n"

In the lecture on Holderlin's \nelegy \"Homecoming\" (1943) this nearness \"of\" being, which the Da of \nDasein is, is thought on the basis of Being and Time; it is perceived as spo\u00ad\nken from the minstrel's poem; from the experience of the oblivion of being \nit is called the \"homeland.\" The word is thought here in an essential sense, \nnot patriotically or nationalistically, but in terms of the history of being. \nThe essence of the homeland, however, is also mentioned with the inten\u00ad\ntion of thinking the homelessness of contemporary human beings from the \nessence of being's history. Nietzsche was the last to experience this home\u00ad\nlessness. [169) From within metaphysics he was unable to find any other \nway out than a reversal of metaphysics. But that is the height of futility. \nOn the other hand, when Holderlin composes \"Homecoming\" he is con\u00ad\ncerned that his \"countrymen\" find their essence. He does not at all seek \nthat essence in an egoism of his people. He sees it rather in the context of a \nbelongingness to the destiny of the West. But even the West is not thought \nregionally as the Occident in contrast to the Orient, nor merely as Europe, \nhut rather world-historically out of nearness to the source. We have still \nscarcely begun to think the mysterious relations to the East that have come \nto Ymrd in Holderlin's poetry (cf. \"The lster\"; also \"The Journey,\" third \nstrophe ff.). \"German\" is not spoken to the world so that the world might \nbe reformed through the German essence; rather, it is spoken to the Ger\u00ad\nmans so that from a destinal belongingness to other peoples they might be\u00ad\ncome world-historical along with them (see remarks on Holderlin's poem \n257 \n"

Homelessness is the symptom of oblivion of being. Because of it the \ntruth of being remains unthought. The oblivion of being makes itselflmown \nindirectly through the fact that the ( 170] human being always observes \nand handles only beings. Even so, because humans cannot avoid having \nsome notion of being, it is explained merely as what is \"most general\" \nand therefore as something that encompasses beings, or as a creation of the \ninfinite being, or as the product of a finite subject.

However, this \nthinking is not ethics in the first instance because it is ontology. For on\u00ad\ntology always thinks solely the being (ov) in its being. But as long as the \nrruth of being is not thought aU ontology remains without its foundation. \nTherefore the thinking that in Being and Time tries to advance thought in a \npreliminary way into the truth of being characterizes itself as \"fundamental \nontology.\" It strives to reach back into the essential ground from which \nthought concerning the truth of being emerges. By initiating another in\u00ad\nquiry this thinking is already removed from the \"ontology\" of metaphysics \n(even that of Kant). \"Ontology\" itself, however, whether transcendental or \nprecritical, is subject to critique, not because it thinks the being of beings \nand in so doing reduces being to a concept, but because it does not think the \ntruth of being and so fails to recognize that there is a thinking more rigor\u00ad\nous than conceptual thinking. In the poverty of its first breakthrough, the \nthinking that tries to advance thought into the truth of being brings only a \nsmall pan of that wholly other dimension to language. This language even \nfalsifies itself, for it does not yet succeed in retaining the essential help of \nphenomenological seeing while dispensing with the inappropriate concern \nwith \"science\" and \"research.\" But in order to make the attempt at thinking \nrecognizable and at the same time understandable for existing philosophy, \nit could at first be expressed only within the horizon of [I 88] that existing \nphilosophy and the use of its current terms. \nIn the meantime I have learned to see that these very terms were bound \nto lead immediately and inevitably into error. For the terms and the con\u00ad\nceptual language corresponding to them were not rethought by readers \nfrom the matter particularly to be thought; rather, the matter was con\u00ad\nceived according to the established terminology in its customary meaning. \nThe thinking that inquires into the truth of being and so defines the hu\u00ad\nman being's essential abode from being and toward being is neither ethics \nnor ontology. Thus the question about the relation of each to the other no \nlonger has any basis in this sphere. Nonetheless, your question, thought in \na more original way, retains a meaning and an essential importance. \nFor it must be asked: If the thinking that ponders the truth of being \ndefines the essence of lmma11itas as ek-sistence from the latter's belonging\u00ad\nness to being, then does thinking remain only a theoretical representation \n"

This proof appears to carry weight only if one posits beings as \nwhat is objective for subjectivity. From this alternative it follows that every \n\"not,\" because it never appears as something objective, must inevitably be \nthe product of a subjective act. But whether no-saying first posits the \"not\" \nas something merely thought, or whether nihilation first requires the \"no\" \nas what is to be said in the letting-be of beings - this can never be decided at \nall by a subjective reflection of a thinking already posited as subjectivity. In \nsuch a reflection we have not yet reached the dimension where the question \ncan be appropriately formulated.

Being nihilates - as being. Therefore the \"not\" \nappears in the absolute Idealism of Hegel and Schelling as the negativ\u00ad\nity of negation in the essence of being. But there being is thought in the \nsense of absolute actuality as the unconditioned will that wills itself and \ndoes so as the will of knowledge and of love. In this willing being as will \nto power is still concealed.

To return to our image, it does not tear up the root of \nphilosophy. It tills the ground and plows the soil for this root. Metaphysics \nremains what comes first in philosophy. What comes first in thinking, how\u00ad\never, it does not reach. When we think the truth of Being, metaphysics is \novercome. We can no longer accept the claim of metaphysics to preside \nover our fundamental relation to \"Being\" or to decisively determine every \nrelation to beings as such. But this \"overcoming of metaphysics\" does not \nabolish metaphysics. As long as man remains the tmimal rati01ale, he is the \nanimal metaphysicum. As long as man understands himself as the rational \nanimal, metaphysics belongs, as Kant said, to the nature of man. But if our \nthinking should succeed in its efforts to go back into the ground of meta\u00ad\nphysics, it might well help to bring about a change in the human essence, a \nchange accompanied by a transformation of metaphysics. \nIf, as we unfold the question concerning the truth of Being, we speak of \novercoming metaphysics, this means: recalling Being itself. Such recalling \ngoes beyond the traditional failure to think the [I 98) ground of the root of \nphilosophy. The thinking attempted in Being tmd Tmu (I 92 7) sets out on \nthe way to prepare an overcoming of metaphysics, so understood.

The term \"Dasein\" neither takes \nthe place of the term \"consciousness,\" nor does the \"matter\" designated as \n\"Dasein\" take the place of what we represent to ourselves when we speak \nof \"consciousness.\" Rather, \"Dasein\" names that which is first of all to be \nexperienced, and subsequently thought accordingly, as a placeb - namely, \nas the locality of the truth of Being. \nWhat the term \"Dasein\" means throughout the treatise Being and Time \nis indicated already by the guiding thesis: \"The 'essence' of Dasein lies in its \nexistence\" (Being and Time, p. 42). \nTo be sure, in the language of metaphysics the word \"existence\" is a \nsynonym of \"Dasein\": both refer to the actuality of anything at all that \nis actual, from God to a grain of sand.

Space is neither simply co\u00ad\nordinated nor merely subordinated to such time.c \nAn attempt to make a transition from the representation of beings as \nsuch to recalling the truth of Being must, in starting from such represen\u00ad\ntation, still represent, in a certain sense, the truth of Being, too; with the \nresult that this latter representation must necessarily be of another kind \nand ultimately, insofar as it is representation, inappropriate to that which \nis to be thought. This relation, which comes out of metaphysics and tries \nto enter into the relation of the truth of Being to the human essence, is \nconceived as \"understanding.\" But here understanding is thought at the \nsame time from out of the unconcealedness of Being. Understanding is \necstatic, thrown projection,d ecstatic here meaning: standing in the realm \nof the open.

The realm of consummate \nnihilism constitutes the border between two world eras. The line that \ndesignates this realm is the critical line. By this line will be decided whether \nthe movement of nihilism comes to an end in a nihilistic nothing, or whether \nit is the transition to the realm of a \"new turning of being\" (p. 32). The \nmovement of nihilism must thus of its own accord be disposed toward \ndifferent possibilities and in keeping with its essence be ambiguous. \nYour assessment of the situation follows the signs whereby we may rec\u00ad\nognize whether and to what extent we are crossing the line and thereby \nexiting from the zone of consummate nihilism.

People were astonished that such a dear-sighted \nbook had been available for years, and that they themselves had not yet \nlearned even to venture the attempt to let their view of the present move \nwithin the optics of The Worker and to think in planetary terms. One could \nsense that even a universal, historiographical consideration of world history \nwas inadequate for such a task. At that time, people read enthusiastically \nThe Marble Cli.fi [Die Ma771W1\"klippen], but, as it seemed to me, without \na sufficiently broad, i.e., planetary, horizon. And we were not surprised, \neither, that an attempt to elucidate The Worker was kept under surveillance \nand eventually prohibited. For it belongs to the essence of the will to power \nnot to let the actual that it gains power over appear in that actuality which \nprevails as the will to power itself. \nYou will permit me to reproduce a note that I made during this attempt \nto elucidate your book. I do so in the hope that I can say some things more \nclearly and freely in the present letter. The note reads: \nErnst Junger's text The Worker is important because, in a different way from \nSpengler, it achieves what all Nietzsche literature thus far has been unable to achieve, \nnamely, to impart an experience of beings and the way in which they are, in the light \nof Nietzsche's projection of beings as will to power. Nietzsche's metaphysics, how\u00ad\never, is by no means comprehended thoughtfully; not even the ways to do so are \nindicated; on the contrary: instead of being worthy of question in a genuine sense, \nthis metaphysics becomes self-evident and seemingly superfluous. \n[2 19] As you can see, the critical question thinks in a direction that \nadmittedly does not belong to the sphere of tasks to be pursued by the \ndescriptions undertaken in The Worker. Much of what your descriptions \nbrought into view and brought to language for the first time is now seen and \nstated by everyone. Moreover, \"The Question concerning Technology\" \nowes a lasting debt to the descriptions in The Worker. It is appropriate to \nnote that your \"descriptions\" do not merely depict something actual that is \nal ready familiar, but make accessible a \"new actuality,\" in which it is \"not so \nrnuch a rnatter of new thoughts or a new system . . .  \" (Preface to The Worker). \nEven today the fruitful aspect of what you say is gathered within \"de\u00ad\nscription\" properly understood - and how should it not be?

For the German is no \nlonger the subject of such mobilization, and the danger thereby grows that \nhe will be conceived as its object.\" Even now you rightly regard total \nmobilization as a distinctive [12 1) characteristic of what is actual. Yet its \nactuality is for you now no longer determined by the \"will to (my emphasis) \ntotal mobilization\" (Der Arbeiter, p. 148), and is no longer determined in \nsuch a way that this will can have validity as the sole source that \"gives \nmeaning\" and justifies everything. Hence you write ( Ober die Linie, p. 30): \n\"There is no doubt that our subsistence (i.e., according to p. 3 1, 'persons, \nworks, and institutions') as a whole is moving across the critical line. The \ndangers and our security are thereby altered.\" In the zone belonging to \nthe line, nihilism approaches its conswnmation. The whole of \"human \nsubsistence\" can cross the line only if this subsistence steps out of the zone \nof consummate nihilism. \nAccordingly, a discussion of the line must ask: Wherein consists the \nconsummation of nihilism? The answer seems to be at hand. Nihilism \nis consummated when it has seized all subsisting resources and appears \nwherever nothing can assert itself as an exception anymore, insofar as such \nnihilism has become our normal condition. Yet in this condition of normal\u00ad\nity the consummation only becomes actualized. The condition of normality \nis a consequence of the conswnmation. Consummation [ Vol/endung) means \nthe gathering of all essential possibilities of nihilism, possibilities that re\u00ad\nmain difficult to see through as a whole and individually. The essential \npossibilities of nihilism can be pondered only if we think back toward its \nessence. I say \"back\" because the essence of nihilism prevails ahead and \nthus in advance of individual nihilistic phenomena, gathering them into its \nconsummation. Yet the consummation of nihilism is not already its end. \n'\\ 3th the consummation of nihilism there first begins the final phase of ni\u00ad\n. h1hsm. The zone of this end-phase, because it is pervaded by a condition \nof normality that sets in, is presumably unusually broad. For this reason \nthe zero-line, where the consummation becomes an end, is not yet visible \nat all in the end. \nYet how do matters stand, then, concerning the prospect of crossing over \nthe line? Is human subsistence already in a transition [zzz] trans lineam, \nor is it now first entering the broad field that stands before the line? But \nrerha4s our eyes deceive us here in an unavoidable way. Perhaps the zero\u00ad\nme wlll emerge suddenly before us in the form of a planetary catastrophe. \n197 \n"

For the idea of the human essence to be able to attain the \nstatus of that which, as ground, already underlies everything present as that \npresence that first permits a \"representation\" among beings and thus \"legit\u00ad\nimizes\" the latter as beings, the human being must first of all be represented \nin the sense of an authoritative, underlying ground.

In his essence the hu\u00ad\nman being is the thoughtful memory [ Gedichtnis] of being, but of \u0090 . \nThis means: the human essence also belongs to that which, in the cross\u00ad\ning out of being, takes thinking into the claim of a more originary call. a \nComing to presence is grounded in the turning that, as such, turns the \nhuman essence in toward it, so that this essence may expend itself for such \nturning. \nLike \u0090 , the nothing would also have to be written - and that means, \nthought - in the same way. This implies that the human essence, in its \nthoughtful commemoration, belongs to the nothing, and not merely as \nsome addition. If, therefore, in nihilism the nothing attains domination in \na particular way, then the human being is not only affected by nihilism, but \nessentially participates in it. In that case, however, the entire \"subsistence\" \nof human beings does not stand somewhere on this side of the line, in order \nthen to cross over it and take up residence on the other side with being .

ZJ). \n\\Vhat else does this say but the fact that the movement toward less and \nless fullness and originariness within beings [141] as a whole is not merely \naccompanied but determined by a growth in the will to power? The will \nto power is that will which wills \nAs this will and within \norders \nit there appears, prefigured early on and prevailing in many \ndifferent ways, that which, represented from the perspective of beings, sur\u00ad\npasses such beings and within such surpassing in tum has an effect on beings, \nwhether as the ground of beings, or as their causation.

In tenns of the \nwording, the question brought up here is indeed that posed by Leibniz \nand taken up by Schelling. Both thinkers understand it as the question \nconcerning the supreme ground and primary existing cause of all beings. \nThe contemporary attempts to restore metaphysics are fond of addressing \nthe said question. \nYet the lecture \"What Is Metaphysics?\", in accordance with its differ\u00ad\nently construed path through another realm, also thinks this question in a \ntransformed manner.

They already stand, without their knowing it, in a relation to \nbeing. Only from the truth of being that prevails on each occasion do they \nreceive a light that first enables them to see and observe as such the beings \nrepresented by them.

Their origin lies more deeply concealed.

These independent areas of research secure for \nthemselves their increasing validity and influence at many levels as devices \nand instruments for the success of the political-economic world, that is to \nsay, of what is, in an essential sense, the technological world. \nBut the incessant disintegration of philosophy, determined from afar, is \nnot after all the end of thinking, but rather something else, yet something \nthat has withdrawn from public ascertainability.

But why, then, this roundabout \napproach through Hegel and the Greeks in order to arrive at the matter of \nthinking? Because we need to take this path, which indeed, in its essence, \nis not a roundabout one; for the tradition, experienced in the right way, \nprovides us the present that stands over against us as the matter of thinking \nand, for that reason, is at issue. Genuine tradition is so far from being \nthe dragging weight of what is past that it much rather frees us for what \napproaches us as present, and thus becomes the enduring directive toward \nthe matter of thinking. \nHegel and the Greeks - this sounds like: Kant and the Greeks, Leibniz \nand the Greeks, medieval Scholasticism and the Greeks. It sounds like \nthis, and yet is nonetheless different. For it is Hegel who, for the first \ntime, thinks the philosophy of the Greeks as a whole and thinks this whole \nphilosophically. In what way is this possible? By virtue of the fact that Hegel \ndetermines history as such in such a way that it must be philosophical in its \nfundamental trait. The history of philosophy is for Hegel the intrinsically \nunitary and hence necessary process of the advance of spirit toward itself. \nThe history of philosophy is no mere sequence of diverse opinions and \nteachings that supersede each other without any connection. \nHegel says in an introduction to his Berlin lectures on the history of \nphilosophy: \"The history which we have before us is the history of thought \nfinding itself\" ( Vorlesungen Uber die Geschicbte der Pbirosopbie, ed. Hoffmeister \n1940, vol. I, p. 81, note). \"For only philosophy itself unfolds the histocy \nof philosophy\" (ibid., pp. 235f.). Accordingly, for Hegel, philosophy as \nthe self-unfolding of spirit toward absolute knowing and the history of \nphilosophy are identical. No philosopher before Hegel gained such a fun\u00ad\ndamental philosophical position (257] as to make possible and require that \nphilosophizing itself move at the same time within its history and that this \nmovement be philosophy itself. But according to a statement of Hegel's \nfrom the introduction to his first lecture here in Heidelberg, philosophy \nhas for its \"goal\": \"truth\" (ibid., p. 14). \nAs Hegel says in a marginal note to the manuscript of this lecture, phi\u00ad\nlosophy is as its history the \"realm of pure truth, - not the deeds of erter7141 \nreality, but rather the inner remaining-with-itself of spirit\" (ibid., p. 6, note). \n\"Truth\" means here: what is true in its pure realization, which at the same \ntime brings to presentation the truth of what is true, truth in its essence. \nMay we now take Hegel's determination of the goal of philosophy, which \nis truth, as hinting at a meditation upon the matter of thinking? Presumably \nso, as soon as we have sufficiently clarified the theme, \"Hegel and the \n3 24 \n"

However, for thinking there is never anything \nfamiliar. Hegel explains: \"With him (namely, with Descartes), we properly \nenter upon a self-supporting philosophy. Here, we can say that we are home \nand, like the sailor who has journeyed on the stormy sea for a long time, cry: \n'Land-ho!' \" (Werke, vol. XV, p. 328). With this image Hegel means to \nsuggest the following: The \"ego cogittt sum, \" the \"I think, I am,\" is the solid \nground upon which philosophy can settle truly and completely. In the phi\u00ad\nlosophy of Descartes, the ego becomes the authoritative subiectum, i.e., that \nwhich already lies before. However, this subject [258] is first taken hold of \nin the right way - namely, in the Kantian sense, transcendentally and com\u00ad\npletely, i.e., in the sense of speculative idealism - when the whole structure \nand movement of the subjectivity of the subject unfolds and is taken up into \nabsolute self-knowing. In lmtYWing itself as this lmowing that conditions all \nobjectivity, the subject is, as this lmowing, the absolute itself. True being is \nthe thinking that thinks itself absolutely. For Hegel, being and thinking are \nthe same, specifically in the sense that everything is taken back into thinking \nand is determined according to what Hegel simply calls \"thought.\" \nSubjectivity, as the ego cogito, is consciousness that represents something, \ndraws what is represented back to itself and in this way gathers it to itself. \nIn Greek, gathering is called /,.fy\u00a3Lv. To gather what is manifold for the I \ninto the I is called, expressed in the middle voice, My\u00a3o6cl. The thinking \nI gathers what is represented in going through that which is represented, \nin going through it in its representability. \"Going through something\" in \nGreek is called lha. \u0515LaAty\u00a3o6ciL, dialectic, signifies here that the subject \nbrings its subjectivity before it, produces it in and as the said process. \nDialectic is the process of the production of the subjectivity of the ab\u00ad\nsolute subject and, as such, its \"necessary activity.\" In accordance with the \nstructure of subjectivity, the production process involves three stages. First \nof all, the subject as consciousness relates itself immediately to its object. \nThis immediately and yet indeterminately represented object Hegel also \ncalls \"being,\" the universal, the abstract. For in this connection abstraction \nis still made from the relation of the object to the subject. Only through \nthis relating back, or reflection, does the object come to be represented as \nobject for the subject, and the subject come to be represented for itself, i.e., \n325 \n"

However, so long as we merely differentiate \nobject and subject, being and reflection, over against each other, and persist \nwith this differentiation, the movement from the object to the subject does \nnot yet set forth the whole of [259] subjectivity for subjectivity. The ob\u00ad\nject, being, is indeed mediated with the subject through reflection, but the \nmediation itself, as the innermost movement of the subject, is not yet repre\u00ad\nsented for the subject. Only when the thesis of the object and the antithesis \nof the subject are detected in their necessary synthesis is the movement of \nthe subjectivity of the subject-object relation complete in its course. This \ncourse is a proceeding from the thesis, advancing to the antithesis, going \nover into the synthesis, and, from out of this synthesis as the whole, the \nreturn to itself of the positing posited. This course gathers the whole of \nsubjectivity into the unfolded unity of subjectivity. In this way, subjectivity \ngrows together, con-crescit, becomes concrete. Dialectic is speculative in \nthis manner. For specu/ari means detecting, catching sight of, apprehend\u00ad\ning, com-prehending. Hegel says in the Introduction to the Science of Logie \n(ed. Lasson, vol. I, p. 38) that speculation consists \"in the apprehending \nof opposites in their unity.\" Hegel's way of characterizing speculation be\u00ad\ncomes clearer if we notice that, in speculation, what is at stake is not only \nthe apprehending of unity, the phase of synthesis, but in the first instance \nand always the apprehending \"of opposites\" as opposites. This requires \napprehending the shining of opposites against one another and in one an\u00ad\nother, which is the manner in which antithesis reigns as it is presented in the \n\"Logic of Essence\" (i.e., the logic of reflection). From this self-re-flecting \nshining, or mirroring, speculari (speculum: mirror) receives its conclusive de\u00ad\ntermination. Considered in this way, speculation is the positive whole of \nthat which \"dialectic\" is meant to signify here: not a transcendental, criti\u00ad\ncally restrictive, or even polemical way of thinking, but rather the mirroring \nand uniting of opposites as the process of the production of spirit itself. \nHegel also calls \"speculative dialectic\" simply \"method.\" By this title he \nmeans neither an instrument of representing nor merely a special way of \nproceeding in [260] philosophy. \"Method\" is the innermost movement of \nsubjectivity, \"the soul of being,\" the production process through which the \nweb of the whole actuality of the absolute is woven. \"Method,\" \"the soul of \nbeing\" - that sounds like fantasy. It is commonly thought that our age has \nleft behind such errors of speculation. Yet we are living right in the midst \nof this supposed fantasy. \nWhen modem physics aims at a formula for the world, then it becomes \napparent that the being of beings has dissolved itself in the method of total \ncalculability.

That is strange, but all the stranger since Hegel closes the Foreword \nto his interpretation of Heraclitus with the words: \"there is no sentence \nof Heraclitus that is not taken up in my logic\" (ibid., p. 328). But for \nthis \"logic\" of Hegel, A6yo<; is reason in the sense of absolute subjectivity, \nthe \"logic\" itself is speculative dialectic, through whose movement what is \nimmediately universal and abstract, being, is reflected as what is objective \nin opposition to the subject, and this reflection is determined as mediation \nin the sense of becoming. In becoming, what is opposed comes together, \nbecomes concrete and in this way comes to unity. To apprehend this unity \nis the essence of that speculation which unfolds itself as dialectic. \nIn Hegel's judgment, Heraclitus is the first to recognize dialectic as a \nprinciple, and thereby to advance further beyond Parmenides. Hegel ex\u00ad\nplains: \"Being (as Parmenides thinks it) is the One, the first; the second \nis becoming - he (Heraclitus) has advanced to this determination. That \nis what is first of all concrete, the absolute, as in it the unity of opposites. \nThus, with him (Heraclitus), the philosophical idea in its speculative form is \nfirst to be found\" (ibid.). In this way, then, Hegel places the main emphasis \nof his interpretation of Heraclitus on the sentences in which the dialectical, \nthe unity and uniting of contradictions, comes to language. \n[265] The basic word of Plato reads: 'IMa. For Hegel's explication of \nPlatonic philosophy, it remains to be considered that he apprehends the \nIdeas as \"the intrinsically determinate universal.\" \"Intrinsically determi\u00ad\nnate\" means: the Ideas are thought in their state of belonging together; \nthey are not mere prototypes existing in themselves, but are rather \"what is \nin and for itself\" as distinct from \"the sensibly existing\" (Werke, vol. XI\\T, \np. 199). \"In and for itself\" - therein lies a coming-to-be-itself, namely, \ncon-ceiving oneself. Accordingly, Hegel can explain: the Ideas are \"not \nimmediately in consciousness (namely, as intuitions), rather they are (me\u00ad\ndiated in consciousness) in cognition.\" \"For this reason, one does not h11Vt \nthem, but rather they are brought forth within spirit through cognition\" \n(ibid., p. 201). This bringing-forth, producing, is conceiving as the activity \nof absolute knowing, i.e., \"science.\" Therefore Hegel says: \"With Plato be\u00ad\ngins philosophical science as science\" (ibid., p. 169). \"What is distinctive of \nPlatonic philosophy is its orientation toward the intellectual, supersensible \nworld . . .  \" (ibid., p. 1 70). \nThe basic word of Aristotle reads: ' Ev\u00a3pye:Oa, which Hegel translates as \n\"actuality\" (the Roman actus). ' Ev\u00a3pye:Pa is \"still more determinately\" the \n\"entelechy (\u00a3v'te:A\u00a3xe:Oa), which is in itself end and realization of the end.\" \n\u00b7 Ev\u00a3pye:Pa is \"pure efficacy from out of itself.\" \"Only energy, form, is \nactivity, that which effects, self-relating negativity\" (ibid., p.

Hegel makes clear his assessment \nof the whole of Aristotelian philosophy in the following sentence: \"If one \nwere to take philosophy seriously, then nothing would be worthier than to \nhold lectures on Aristotle\" (ibid., p. 3 14). \nAccording to Hegel, philosophy becomes \"serious\" when it no longer \nloses itself in objects and in subjective reflection upon objects, but rather \nbecomes active as the activity of absolute knowing. \nClarifying the four basic words allows us to recognize that Hegel un\u00ad\nderstands \nY Ev, A6yoc;, ' I8E11, and 'Evtpye:Lil within the horizon of being, \nwhich he conceives as the abstract universal.

(A 598, B 616) \nIn view of that which today is, which in being besets us and which as \npossible nonbeing threatens us, Kant's thesis about being strikes us as ab\u00ad\nstract, meager, and pale. For, meanwhile, it has also been demanded of \nphilosophy that it no longer be satisfied with interpreting the world and \nroving about in abstract speculations, but rather that what really matters \nis changing the world practically. But changing the world in the manner \nintended requires beforehand that thinking be changed, just as a change \nof thinking already underlies the demand we have mentioned. (Cf. [175] \nKarl Marx, The German ldeolog;y: \"A. Theses on Feuerbach ad F euerbach, 1 1 \": \n\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point \nis to change it.\") \nBut in what way is thinking supposed to change if it does not take the path \ninto that which is worthy of thought? Now, the fact that being presents itself \nas that which is worthy of thought is neither an optional presupposition nor \nan arbitrary invention. It is the verdict of a tradition that still governs us \ntoday, and this far more decisively than one might care to admit. \nKant's thesis offends us as abstract and inadequate only if we fail to \nconsider what Kant said in elucidation of it and how he said it. We must \nfollow the path of his elucidation of the thesis. We must bring before our \neyes the region in which that path runs. We must bear in mind the site \nwhere what Kant discusses and situates under the name \"being\" belongs. a \n\u2022 Fir.t edition, 19li3: Topology of being. \n"

Positio, \nponrl\"e, means to set, place, lay, lie, to lie before, to lie at the gro\u049e_nd. \nIn the course of the history of onto theological inquiry the task has arisen \nnot only of showing what the highest being is but of proving that this most \nsupreme of beings is, that God exists. The words Existenz, Dasein, actuality, \nname a mode of being. \nIn the year 1 763, almost two decades before the appearance of the \nCritique of Pure Reason, Kant published a work under the title The Only \nPossible Ground of Proof for a Dmumstration of the Existence of God. The \"First \nConsideration\" in this work deals with the concepts of \"Existence [Dasein] \nin general\" and \"being in general.\" Here we already find Kant's thesis about \nbeing, and even in the twofold form of the negative and the affirmative as\u00ad\nsertion. The wording of both assertions agrees in a certain manner with \nthat in the Critique of Pure Reason. The negative assertion goes like this in \nthe precritical work: \"Existence is not a predicate or determination of any\u00ad\nthing whatever.\" The affirmative assertion goes: \"The concept of positing \nor asserting [Position oder Setzung] is completely simple and identical with \nthat of being in general.\" \nAt first it was necessary only to point out that Kant formulates the thesis \nwithin the province of the questions of philosophical theology. This dom\u00ad\ninates the entire question about the being of beings, i.e., metaphysics in its \ncentral content. From this it can be seen that the thesis about being is no \nout-of-the-way, abstract bit of doctrine, as its wording might at first easily \npersuade us. \nIn the Critique of Pure Reason the negative-defensive assertion is intro\u00ad\nduced with an \"obviously.\" That means it is supposed to be immediately \nevident to everyone: being - [279] \"obviously\" not a real predicate. For us \ntoday the statement is by no means immediately clear. Being - this means, \nof course, reality. How, then, could being not count as a real predicate? \nBut for Kant the word \"real\" still has its original meaning. It means that \nwhich belongs to a res, to a substance, to the substantive content of a thing. \nA real predicate, a determination belonging to a substance, is, for example, \nthe predicate \"heavy\" with respect to the stone, regardless of whether the \nstone really exists or not. In Kant's thesis \"real\" means, then, not that which \nwe mean today when we speak of Realpolitik, which deals with facts, with \nthe actual. Reality is for Kant not actuality but rather substantiality. A real \npredicate is such as belongs to the substantive content of a thing and can \nhe attributed to it. We represent and place before ourselves the substantive \ncontent of a thing in its concept. We can place before ourselves what the \nword \"stone\" names without its being necessary that the thing in question \n341 \n"

Being is nothing real. \nBut how is that? After all, we do say of a stone lying before us that it, this \nstone here, exists. This stone is. Accordingly, the \"is,\" i.e., being, shows \nitself just as obviously as predicate, namely, in the assertion about this stone \nas the subject of the assertion. Nor does Kant deny in the Critique of Purt \nReason that the existence predicated of an existing stone is a predicate. But \nthe \"is\" is no real predicate. Of what is the \"is\" predicated then? Obviously \nof the existing stone. And what does this \"is\" in the assertion \"The stone \nis here\" say? It says nothing about what the stone, as stone, is; it does \nsay, however, that what belongs to the stone exists here, is\u095d 'what is called \nbeing, then? Kant answers with the affirmative assertion in his thesis: Being \n\"is merely the positing of a thing or of certain determinations in and of \nthemselves.\" \n[z8o] The wording of this statement easily misleads one into supposing \nthat being as \"merely the positing of a thing\" concerns the thing in the \nsense of the thing in and for itself. This meaning the thesis cannot have, \ninsofar as it is expressed within the Critique of Pure Reason. \"Thing\" here \nmeans something for which Kant also says \"object\" or \"Gegmstand. \" Nor \ndoes Kant say that the positing concerns the thing with all its real deter\u00ad\nminations; what he says is rather, \"merely the positing of the thing, or of \ncertain determinations in and of themselves.\" How the phrase \"or of certain \ndeterminations\" is to be interpreted we shall leave open for now. \nThe expression \"in and of itselr' does not mean: \"something_m its_elf.\" \nsomething that exists unrelated to a consciousness. The \"in and of itself\" \nwe must understand as marking the distinction from what is represented \nas this or that with regard to something else. This sense of \"in itself\" is \nalready expressed in Kant's statement, in his saying that being \"is merely \nthe positing.\" This \"merely\" sounds like a limitation, as if the positing were \nsomething inferior to the reality, i.e .\u2022 to the substantiality of a thing. The \n\"merely,\" however, indicates that being can never be explained by what any \ngiven being is, i.e., for Kant, by the concept. The \"merely\" does not limit, \nbut rather assigns being to a domain where alone it can be characterized in \nits purity. \"Merely\" means here: purely. \"Being\" and \"is\" belong, with all \ntheir meanings and inflections, in a domain of their own. They are nothing \nthing-like, i.e., for Kant, nothing objective. \nIn order to think of\"being\" and \"is,\" therefore, another view is required, \none that is not guided exclusively by observing things and by reckoning with \n342 \n"

[z8r] Does not this interpretation of being as positing re\u00ad\nmain for us strange, even arbitrary, or in any case ambiguous and therefore \ninexact? \nKant himself, to be sure, translates \"positing,\" \"Position, \" by Setzung. \nBut this does not help much. For our German word Setzung is just as \nambiguous as the Latin positio. The latter can mean: (1) Setting, placing, \nlaying as action. (z) Something set, the theme. (3) Setness [GesetztheitJ, \nsite, constitution. But we can also understand Position and Setzung in such \na way that they mean the unity of the positing of something posited as such \nin its positedness. \nIn every case the characterization of being as positing points to an am\u00ad\nbiguity that is not accidental and also not unknown to us. For it plays about \neverywhere in the realm of that setting and placing that we know as repre\u00ad\nsenting. For this, the learned language of philosophy has two characteristic \nnames: representing is percipere, perceptio, to take something to oneself, \ngrasp; and: repraesentare, to hold opposite oneself, to hold present to one\u00ad\nself. In representing we place something before ourselves, so that it, as \nthus placed (posited), stands over against us as object. Being, as position, \nmeans the positedness of something in representational positing. Accord\u00ad\ning to what is posited and how it is posited, positing, position, being has a \ndifferent meaning. Kant, therefore, after setting up his thesis about being \nin the text of the Critique of Pure Reason, continues: \nIn its logical use it [i.e., being as \"merely the position\") is merely the copula of a \njudgment. The proposition \"God is omnipotent\" contains two concepts, each of \nwhich has its object - God and omnipotence. The small word \"is\" adds no new \npredicate, but only serves to posit the predicate in its n:lation to the subject. \nIn The Only Possible Ground of Prof the relationship between the subject \nand predicate of the sentence as posited by the \"is\" of the copula is called the \nre.fpectus logicus. Kant's talk of the \"logical use\" of\"being\" causes one to sup\u00ad\npose that there is yet another use [z8z ] of\"being.\" At the same time we are \nat this point already learning something essential about being. It is \"used,\" \nin the sense of applied. This use is accomplished by the understanding, by \nthinking. \n\\\\!hat other use of \"being\" and of the \"is\" is there, besides the \"logical\" \none?

The logic, however, is no \nlonger formal logic, but the logic determined by the original synthetic unity \nof transcendental apperception. In such logic ontology is grounded. This \nconfirms what we have already said: Being and existence are determined by \ntheir relationship to the use of the understanding. \nEven now the main title for the interpretation of the being of beings is \nstill: \"Being and Thought.\" But the legitimate use of the understanding \ndepends on the following: that thinking continues to be specified as repre\u00ad\nsentational thinking that posits and judges - i.e., as positing and proposition \nby virtue of transcendental apperception, and that thinking remains related \nto affection by the senses.

It is therefore an error of \nNeo-K.antianism, still being felt today, to say that through Kant's philoso\u00ad\nphy the concept of being is, as one says, \"resolved.\" The age-old prevailing \nmeaning of being (constant presence) not only is preserved in Kant's crit\u00ad\nical interpretation of being as the abjectness of the object of experience, \nbut even reappears in an exceptional form in the definition of \"abjectnes,\" \nwhile the interpretation of being as the substantiality of substance, which \notherwise prevails in the history of philosophy, virtually covers it up or \neven disguises it.

Nevertheless, we are already \nprepared for a first understanding, and this, indeed, by means of that which \nKant explains about being in the negative assertion of his thesis: \"Being \nis obviously not a real predicate.\" This means: Being, and therefore also \nthe modes of being - being possible, being actual, being necessary - do not \nsay anything about what the Gegenstand, the object, is, but rather about \nbow the object is related to the subject. With respect to this \"how\" the \nso-called concepts of being are called \"modalities.\" Kant himself begins his \nclarification of the \"postulates\" with the following statement: \nThe categories of modality have the peculiarity that, in determining an object, they \ndo not in the least enlarge the concept [namely, that of the subject of the sentence] \nto which they are attached as predicates. They only express the relation to our \nfaculty of cognition.

In the predicates of being possible, being actual, and being necesary \nthere lies a \"determination of the object\" - only, however, a \"certain\" de\u00ad\ntermination, insofar as something is stated about the object in itself, about \nit as object - namely, with regard to its objectivity, i.e., its standing-over\u00ad\nagainst-ness [Gegmrtindigkeit], with regard to the existence peculiar to it, \nbut not with regard to its reality, i.e., its substantiality [Sacbbeit]. For the \ncritical-transcendental interpretation of the being of beings, the precritical \nthesis that being is \"not a predicate at all\" is no longer valid. Being, as be\u00ad\ning possible, being actual, being necessary, is not, to be sure, a real (ontic) \npredicate, but it is a transcendental (ontological) predicate. \n[295] Now for the first time we understand the initially strange word\u00ad\ning that Kant uses in the affirmative assertion of his thesis in the text of \nthe Critique of Pure Reason: \"Being . . . is merely the positing of a thing \nor of cenain determinations in and of themselves.\" \"Thing\" means now, \naccording to the language of the Critique, object or Gegenstand. The \"cer\u00ad\ntain\" determinations of the object as the object of the cognition are the \n353 \n"

      "full_text": "KANT'S THESIS ABOUT BEING \n\\ Vhat stands here on both sides of the conjunction \"and\" has been elucidated \nas Kant meant it. \nBut what does the \"and\" mean in \"Being and Thought\"? We are not \nembarrassed for the answer and can easily dispose of the matter. We can \nreadily appeal in this case to one of the oldest maxims of philosophy, the \nsaving of Parmenides that goes, to ytlp a1hb voE\u0516v \u00a3ot(v tE xal dvaL. \"For \nth\n.\ninking and being are the same.\" \nThe relationship between thinking and being is sameness, identity. The \ntitle \"Being_a_n\u04a0_Thought\" s_!tys1 being and thought are i\u04a1entical. As if it \nwere decided what identical means, as if the sense of identity lay at hand, \nand in particular, lay at hand right here in this distinctive \"case\" in respect \nof the relation between being and thought. Both are obviously nothing \nlike things or objects between which one might, unchallenged, calculate \nthis way or that. In no case does \"identical\" mean the same as \"equal.\" \nBeing and thought: [305] in this \"and\" lies concealed that which is worthy \nof thought, both for philosophy up to now and for present-day thinking. \nBut the presentation of the Kantian thesis has shown that being as posit\u00ad\ning is determined in terms of its relationship to the empirical use of the \nunderstanding. The \"and\" in the tide suggests this relationship, which, \naccording to Kant, has its foothold in thinking, i.e., in an activity of the \nhuman subject. \nOf what sort is this relationship? The characterization of thinking as \nreflection of reflection gives us a hint, even if only an approximate, not \nto say misleading, one. Thought plays a double role: in the first place as \nreflection and then as reflection of reflection. But what does all this mean? \nGiven the assumption that the characterization of thinking as reflection \nsuffices to specify the relation to being, then this means that thinking as \nsimple positing provides the horizon within which such qualities as posit\u00ad\nedness and objectivity can be seen. The function of thought is to provide a \nhorizon for the elucidation of being and of its modalities as positing. \nThinking as reflection of reflection means, on the other hand, the pro\u00ad\ncess whereby, and also the instrument and organon wherewith, being as \nglimpsed in the horiwn of positedness is interpreted. Thinking as re\u00ad\nflection means the horiwn, thinking as reflection of reflection means the \norganon for the interpretation of the being of beings. In the tide \"Being and \nThought,\" thinking remains essentially ambiguous in the indicated sense, \nand this holds for the entire history of Western thought. \nBut how would it be, now, if we take being in the sense of originary Greek \nthought, as the self-clearing and enduring presence of that which is for a \nwhile, not only and not in the first instance as positedness in being posited \n"

However, \nsince Heidegger plays on the literal meaning of the noun \"Dasein\" as \"being \nthere,\" and that of the verb \"dasein\" as \"to be there,\" I have often also used the \nEnglish translation, \"existence or being there,\" or simply \"being there.\" (frans.) \nPhmommology and Theology \nFirst published in The Piety of Thinking, translated with notes and commen\u00ad\ntary by James G.

And this is also the sole intent - an intent indicated clearly enough \nin the structuring and layout of\u00a7\u00a7 14-24 of Being and T111e - of the analysis of \nthe environing world, an analysis that as a whole, and considered with regard \nto the leading goal, remains of subordinate significance. \nYet if nature is apparently missing - not only nature as an object of natural \nscience, but also nature in an originary sense (cf. Being and T111e, p. 65 below) -\nin this orientation of the analytic of Dasein, then there are reasons for this. \nThe decisive reason lies in the fact that nature does not let itself be encoun\u00ad\ntered either within the sphere of the environing world, nor in general primarily \nas something tuward which we co1nport ourselves. Nature is originarily mani\u00ad\nfest in Dasein through Dasein's existing as finding itself attuned in the 1nidst of \nbeings. But insofar as finding oneself [Befindlichluit] (thrownness) belongs to \nthe essence of Dasein, and comes to be expressed in the unity of the full con\u00ad\ncept of care, it is only here that the basis for the problem of nature can first be \nattained. \n6o The German zeitigm is used in Being and Ti11e to designate the \"temporalizing\" \nof Dasein as ecstatic temporality. Its more conventional usage implies mat\u00ad\nuration, flourishing, arising. Thus, the present usage suggests that Dasein's \nselfhood first comes into being in and through a temporalizing. (frans.) \n61 The words \"i.e., belongs to Dasein,. (d.h. daseinszugehOrig) do not appear in \nthe first edition of Wegmarken. (frans.) \n3 First edition, 1 929: And indeed in such a way that the manner in which the concept of \nworld is grasped avoids from the outset the path of ros rratum taken by the traditional, \nuntie metaphysics of nature. \n370 \n"

Presumably, \nhowever, the elucidation of transcendence first achieves an athquate conetpt of \nDastin, and with respect to this being it can then be oslred how things stand \nontologically concerning the relation of Dasein to God. \n63 Republic VI, 509 B. \n64 This parenthetical addition is not found in the first edition of Wtgm-lren. \n(Ii\u00b7ans.) \n6; Ibid., 509 A. \n66 Here we may be permitted to point out that what has been published so far \nof the investigations on \"Being and Time\" has no other task than that of a \nconcrete projection unveiling transctndmce (cf. \u00a7\u00a7 1 2.-83; especially \u00a769). This \nin tum occurs for the purpose of enabling the sole guiding intention, clearly \nindicated in the title of the wholt of Part I, of attaining the \"trtmScrndmtal hori\u00ad\nzon of the question concerning being.\" All concrete interpretations, above all \nthat of time, are to be evaluated solely in the perspective of rnobling the question \nof being. They have as little to do with modem \"dialectical theology\" as with \nmedieval Scholasticism. \nIf Dasein is here interpreted as that being that in general can pose such a \nthing as a problem of being as belonging to its existence, then this does not mean \nthat this being, which os Dosein can exist authentically and inauthentically, is the \n\"authentic\" being in general among all other beings, so that the latter would be \nonly a shadow of the former. Quite on the contrary, the illumination of tran\u00ad\nscendence is meant to attain that horizon within which the concept of being -\nincluding the \"natural\" concept that is often appealed to - can first be philo\u00ad\nsophically grounded os a concept. Ontological interpretation of being in and \nfrom out of the transcendence of Dasein does not, however, mean on tic deriva\u00ad\ntion of the sum-total of non-Dasein-like beings from this being qua Dasein. \nAs regards the reproach - which is connected with such misinterpretation -\nof an \"anthropocentric standpoint\" in Being and Ttme, this objection that is now \npassed all too readily from hand to hand says nothing so long as one omits to \nthink through the approach, the entire thrust, and the goal of the development \nof the problem in Being and Ttme and to comprehend how, precisely through \nthe elaboration of the transcendence of Dasein, \"the human being\" comes into \nthe \"center\" in such a way that his nothingness amid beings as a whole can and \nmust become a problem in the first place. \\Vhat dangers are entailed, then, by \nan \"anthropocentric standpoint\" that precisely puts its entire effort solely into \nshowing that the eSJence of Dasein that there stands \"at the center\" is ecstatic, \ni.e., \"excentric, \" yet that therefore, in addition, the alleged freedom from any \nstandpoint, which is contrary to the entire meaning of philosophizing as an es\u00ad\nsentially ji11itt possibility of existing, is a delusion? Cf. here the interpretation \nof the ecstaric-horizonal structure of time as temporality in Bei11g a11d Time, \nPart I, pp. J I6-4Jtl. \n67 In the present investigation, the Temporal (temporale] interpretation of tran\u00ad\nscendence is intentionally set aside throughout. \nfill The first edition of WegmarJ:m simpl}' reads: \"as a being\" (als Seimdes), rather \nthan \"as the heing that it is\" (tlls das Seimde, dns es ist).

Because \nmodem usage often employs \"work\" and \"labor\" indiscriminately, however, \nespecially with regard to the factory \"worker,\" I have retained the latter tenn \nthroughout. (Trans.) \n4 The German Wesm, generally rendered as \"esence,\" traditionally has the nom\u00ad\ninal sense of essmtil, referring to the fundamental \"whatness\" or primary \"sub\u00ad\nstance\" of something. For Heidegger, the word Wesm carries the verbal and \ntemporal sense of being (Sem) as the essential unfolding and enduring presenc\u00ad\ning (An-wesm) of something. (Trans.) \n5 \nGe-SteD (sometimes written GesteO) is the tenn by which Heidegger designates \nthe \"essence\" of modem technology. It is often translated as \"en framing.\" See \nthe essay \"Die Frage nach der Tecbnik\" for further details (Vortrage tmd Aufiatu \n[5th ed.] [Pfullingen: Neske, 1985], pp. 9-40).

William Lovitt (New York: Harper & Row, 1977), \nPP\u00b7 3-35.] (Trans.) \n6 The phrase Verwmdung der Metlpbysik is difficult to render into English. \nHeidegger uses the word Verwmdung to suggest something other than a straight\u00ad\nforward \"overcoming\" (Uberwindung) that would be accomplished by human \nbeings (or by human thinking as subjectivity), and that would simply leave \nbehind it whatever is \"overcome.\" Verwindung implies recovery in the sense \nthat metaphysics itself, in its \"essence,\" recovers from the oblivion of its own \nessence. As Heidegger goes on to clarify, it is not therefore to be taken as \nimplying that human beings recover from metaphysics; nor is it human beings \nin the first instance who \"recover\" metaphysics in the sense of \"retrieving\" \nits essence. In the phrase \"recovery of metaphysics,\" metaphysics is itself the \n\"subject\" of the genitive. Elsewhere, Heidegger explains that the Verwindung \nof the \"essence of technology\" in the direction of its as yet concealed truth \"is \nsimilar to what happens when, in the human realm, one recovers from grief \nor pain.\" See Die Kehre (1949), Gesamtausgahe, vol. 79, p. 69 (translated by \nWilliam Lovitt as \"The Turning,\" in The Question concerning Tecbnowgy, p. 39). \nVerwmdung does, therefore, imply an \"overcoming,\" but what is overcome is \nnot left behind or escaped. (Trans.) \n7 The first edition of Wegmarkm simply reads: \"a surpassing of beings as such,\" \n(der Uberstieg iiher das Seiende als sokhes).

In this regard, cf. \nthe Foreword to the third edition (1915) of Jaspers's Psychology of Worldviws, \nwhich without naming names provides a response to Heidegger's critical review: \nThis new edition is an unaltered reprint of the second edition. Allow me to make a few \npurely personal comments as to why a revised edition would be difficult. \nThe result would be a new bok. In representing worldviews as moments or di\u00ad\nmensions of the one true worldview, which comprehends the whole only vaguely and \nnever explicidy, I anempted at that time to formulate all this on the basis of intuition, \nand to communicate it to my readers without any second thoughts. The particulars \nof what was presented in this manner still seem to me today to be true. I would be \nunable to do it bener today. I could only do it differendy. Following this first endeavor \nthat used an immediate, intuitive approach, I have for quite some time been concerned \nwith the methodological issue of venturing the second step of providing a logically \nprecise elucidation of our modem consciousnes of existence. Therefore, allowing my \nyouthful undertaking to remain in its original form would seem to be the more natural \nthing to do. Without my being aware of it or wishing it at the time, my whole approach \nin the bok and my method of analysis expressed a hidden ideal. I fully acknowledge \nthis, now that I have become aware of it. However, the limits found in the nature of this \nkind of presentation demand that the same content should appear in different forms. I \nam presendy endeavoring to come up with a new form, and the wrong way to do this \nwould be to revise what has already been published. In my subsequent work, I have \nbecome a different person not in my cast of mind, but rather in the realm of knowledge \nand logical form. And I would rather leave m}' earlier work untouched in the hope that, \nafter this first anempt to provide a psychological explanation and foundation for philo\u00ad\nsophical existence, I will also be able to be present a logically systematic clarification \nand foundation. \nAnother possible result of a revised edition would be damage to the bok. Since \nthe hook has ce\"ain flaws (in its arrangement, methodical comments, and historical \ndigressions, i.e., in maners that should be considered unessential with rt.'spect to the \npurpose of the bok), I would want to correct these in a revised edition, taking advantage \nof my present insights into the bok. Pages and sentences that are weak could be deleted, \na lnt of the terminology could be altered, and above all lacunae could be filled and the \nsystemati<.'S of the whole bok could be rearranged without affecting the particulars. \n379 \n"

Here it takes the early form of the question concerning the \nmeaning of the being of the \"I am\" (existence, Dasein) as distinct from the \nmeaning of being found in the \"something is something\" that belongs to \nobjectifying thinking. \nThe essays have been newly ordered in accordance with the chronolog\u00ad\nical principle of when they were written. The volume now contains path\u00ad\nmarks belonging to the period from I 919 to 1961. The correspondence of \npagination with that of the first edition (1967) is given in the margins. \nVarious minor textual corrections that serve only to clarify were incor\u00ad\nporated from Heidegger's own editions. According to the author, these cor\u00ad\nrections were not to be explicidy noted. In addition, all texts were examined \nfor previous printing errors. The \"Postscript to '\\Vhat Is Metaphysics?' \" \nindicates in its numbered footnotes the original 194 3 version of those places \nin rhe text that were altered for the fifth edition ( 1 949), and which triggered \nextensive discussion in the secondary literature. \nThe margi11al notes that appear in the footnotes and are indicated by let\u00ad\nters (a, b, c) are, by general decision of the author, to be reserved solely for \nthe volumes of the Gesamtausgabe. They were drawn from Heidegger's per\u00ad\nsonal editions of separate publications of the texts collected in Wep;marken, \n"
