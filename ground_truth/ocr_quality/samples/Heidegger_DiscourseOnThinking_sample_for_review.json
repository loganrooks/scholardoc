He does it, in\npart, by using a language that is simple and has the flavor\nof the earth. He strives for simile and metaphor involving\nthe soil and growth, and by this means he achieves a poetic\ntone. Not that his sentence structure\nor paragraph\norgani-\nzation is poetic, for it is not; but phrases and words oc-\ncurring\nin the larger\ncontext\noften\nevoke overtones\nof\nfeeling associated with the land, with fields, and with what\nis the ground of things.1 There is, then, no veil of words\nstanding between the audience and Heidegger's\nconception\nof man's authentic nature; rather, words are used with the\ndirectness\nof reference\nwhich only poetic handling\ncan\nachieve. Yet the Address and dialogue are not especially\neasy to follow, although the former is much simpler than\nthe latter. Actually, Heidegger\nwrites in the manner\nand\nwith the poetic tone of the mystics, as for example Meister\nEckhart to whom he refers. Thus his enterprise might be\nconceived as similar in difficulty to the task of the mystics\nwho, by an extraordinary\nand poetic use of words, want to\ntake us with them beyond the ordinary and the familiar, to\nwhat is ultimate.\n1. For Heidegger's views on language and its function cf. Was ist Meta-\nphyrsik?\npp. 50 if. (Frankfurt\na.M.: Klostermann, 1929, 8th ed. 1960), and\nUnterwegs zur Sprache (Pfullingen: Giinther Neske, 1959).\n, INTRODUCTION\n15\nThis raises the question of whether Heidegger's methods,\ntypical of his later writings,\nprovide a better method for\ndealing with the ultimate than is to be found in his earlier\nwritings,\nparticularly\nin Being and Time.\nIt\nis often\nclaimed that Heidegger\nin Being and Time failed to ac-\ncomplish what he intended. But what did he intend?\nThe\namount\nof technical\nterminology\nthat\nmust be mastered\nif we are to judge whether the enterprise projected in Being\nand Time succeeds or not is very great. Fortunately,\nsuch\nmastery is not essential to an understanding\nof the outlines\nof the enterprise itself. Indeed, Heidegger states the nature\nof the enterprise succinctly in the first pages of this work:\nDo we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really\nmean by the word \"being\"? Not at all. So it-is fitting that we should\nraise anew the question of the meaning\nof Being. But are we now-\nadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression\n\"Being\"? Not at all. So first of all we must reawaken an under-\nstanding for the meaning of this question. Our aim in the follow-\ning treatise is to work out the question of the meaning of Being\nand to do so concretely.f\nEvidently, Heidegger\nintends to reawaken modern man to\nthe significance of the nature of Being, and to provide an\naccount of its nature.\nThis is a bold enterprise,\nand one\nwhich belongs in the mainstream\nof Western philosophy.\nThose who have read Being and Time will remember\nthat one of its major themes is the claim that the traditional\napproaches to Being have failed; that the conception of Be-\ning as a generic object, as beyond experience, has misled\nphilosophical efforts to grasp its nature. In Being and Time,\nby contrast with that tradition, Heidegger follows a method\n2.

If a rich\nand complex analysis may be stated in a few sentences,\none might say that Heidegger's\nmethod is to develop, first,\nan account of experience which discloses man as that being\nfor whom his own being is at stake. He then proceeds to\nshow that such a being as man is through\nand through\ntemporal. Finally, he adumbrates an account which would\nlead from time to Being. To restate this analysis of!experi-\nence: when and to the extent that\nman comes to define\nhimself as aware that his own being is at stake, he comes\nto authentic existence as temporal;\nand, as authentic, takes\na place in and comprehends Being.\nThe analysis of experience in Being and Time which is\ndirected toward this end uses what is called the phenomeno-\nlogical method, that is, it elicits from a variety of experi-\nences certain\npervasive\nstructures\nof experience.\nThese\npervasive structures are, to use the Kantian term, transcen-\ndental,\nor, as Reidegger\ncalls them,\nontological;\nthat is,\nthey structure\nall of experience. Such structures ultimately\nreveal the temporal ground of man's being; as, for exam-\nple, the structures\ncalled being toward death and resolve\ndo, when we come to see that in them man is actively en-\ngaged in caring.\nThe question we must ask next is whether\na method\neliciting man's temporal being in the terms of these tran-\nscendental\nstructures\nenables Reidegger\nto carry out his\nenterprise\nand to formulate\nthe nature\nof Being. As has\nbeen indicated,\nmany\nreaders\nof Being\nand Time\nhave\nfound the enterprise incomplete and incompletable.\nLogi-\ncally, the difficulty standing\nin the way\nof completion\nINTRODUCTION\n17\nseems to be that the transcendental\nstructures of experience\nwhich Heidegger\nelicits are formulated\nas static and final,\nThese structures\nprovide a grasp of man's being\nas tem-\nporal; but because they are the structures of man's experi-\nence, they can do this in a limited way only. These struc-\ntures constitute the horizons of human\nawareness, and a\nmethod which explicitly formulates\nthem extends our un-\nderstanding\nbeyond the contents of awareness to its deeper\nnature\nas such. The formulation\nOf the horizons, the con-\nditions 0\u00a3 awareness, reveals man as temporal;\nbut such a\nformulation\nreveals this solely as man sees it, solely in hu-\nman terms, There is in such a method an ineluctably\nsub-\njective orientation which must characterize its results. Thus\nit seems impossible to escape from subjective distortions and\nto learn\nanything\nabout Being as such by means of the\nmethod Heidegger\nused in Being and Tithe. What\nseems\nto be necessary in order to comprehend\nBeing is a method\nof understanding\nwhich can grasp man's\nnature\nas tem-\nporal in terms of its ground, rather\nthan simply in terms\nof the horizons of experience. Such a method could reveal\nman's\ntemporality\nin relation to what was beyond man,\nand not merely in the terms of' man himself.\nBut there is circumstantial\nas well as logical evidence for\nbelieving that the enterprise\nof Being c:-ndTime remains\nincomplete.\nWe know, for example, that Reidegger\nout-\nlined this work, initially, to include material not published\nin the book, although\nit is probable that it was written.\nBeing and Time\nas published consists of but a part of a\nlonger\nprojected\nstudy.

The\nwhole of the claim implicit in the account Heidegger gives\nof Being in the Conversation rests upon the assumption that\nthe analysis of man's nature, as found in meditative think-\ning, provides the key to a direct approach to Being. Close\nattention to the nature of this assumption, and to the evi-\ndence which Heidegger gives for it, will provide consider-\nable insight into the problem of 'its justification.\nIn the Conversation, three kinds of evidence seem to be\noffered for the justification\nof this assumption. This evi-\ndence amounts to showing that Being as reached through\nmeditative thinking is partly identical with the nature and\nmovement of such thinking.\nCertainly if this were not so,\nmeditative\nthinking\nwould be powerless to reach\nBeing.\nThe\ndetails given in the\nConversation\nmust\nbe studied\ncarefully\nto understand\nthe point fully,\nand here a sug-\ngestion of the argument\nand its results must suffice. Fortu-\nnately, it is the nature of the evidence, and not its details,\nwhich is important\nfor an understanding\nof Heidegger's\ngeneral claim. Thus we may observe first that meditative\nthinking\nis an opening of man to something, as is empha-\nsized by calling such thinking releasement.\nIn releasement man is open, that is, is an openness. What\nthen, we may ask, does man open to? In a word, of course,\nthe answer is: to the given. But Heidegger\nis not content\nto present this answer, for he wishes to justify the identity\nhe is claiming. To do so, he argues that the given, too, is an\nopenness and, as we shall see, an opening. Meditative think-\ning characterizes man's true nature, his being, as openness\nin which he is partly identified with the given. Man be-\nINTRODUCTION\n29\ncomes partly identified with the given by opening to it as\n.\n,\nill turn, the given opens to him.\nLet us consider this argument\nsomewhat more carefully.\nAs already noted, meditative thinking\ninvolves an aware-\nness of the field of awareness, or, as Heidegger likes to say,\nan awareness of the horizon of the consciousness of objects.\nIf one comprehends this situation fully, one sees that medi-\ntative thinking is an opening to what is beyond the horizon\nof such knowing. But the possibility of any such opening\nmust depend to some degree upon what lies beyond the\nhorizon, and, indeed, upon the openness of that. To restate\nthe argument:\nviewed from within, our consciousness of the\nworld of objects is an unbounded field of awareness; viewed\nfrom within,\nthis field of awareness has no fixed limits,\nbut only a horizon. In part, meditative thinking\nconsists in\nbecoming aware of the horizon as such, that is, as an open-\ning out and so as standing open. But an awareness of the\nhorizon in this explicit sense as an openness is possible just\nbecause the horizon is set within an openness of which it is\nbut one side, as it were. The openness in which the horizon\nof consciousness is set Heidegger calls the region.\nWhat is evident of the horizon [its openness], then, is but the side\nfacing us of an openness which surrounds us; an openness which\nis filled with views of the appearances of what to our re-pre-\nsenting\nare objects. In\nconsequence the\nhorizon\nis still some-\nthing else besides a horizon ...\n[and] this something else is the\nother side of itself, and so the same as itself. You say that the\nhorizon is the openness which surrounds us. But what is this open-\nness as such, if we disregard that it can also appear as the horizon\nof our re-presenting? It strikes me as something like a region ....\n12\n12. \"Conversation,\"\np. 64 ff. below.\n"

The relation between man and\nthat-which-regions\nis much more oomplex than this, for\nthe sense in which\nmeditative\nthinking\nreceives and is\nnecessary for the coming forth of all natures is as important\nas this identity.\nThus, to proceed from man's nature\nto\nBeing, Heidegger\nneeds to produce a second kind of evi-\ndence that this is possible.

Heidegger seeks to make the diffi-\ncult analysis which will clarify this point, first in terms of\nhistory,\nand then\nin an interesting\ngeneralization\nwith\nrespect to truth based upon his interpretation\nof history.\nThere is a sense in which, as a consequence of man's re-\nsolve for truth, that-which-regions\nis disclosed in history.F\nTo understand this we must observe initially that the process\nof that-which-regions,\nits regiqning,\ntakes place in two\nquite different ways. To emphasize this difference, Heideg-\nger refers to this process when it results in things as deter-\nmining, but when it results in man he calls it regioning\nwith respect to man. Put in this way, this duality empha-\nsizes man's nature as involved in and involving truth,\nand\ncontrasts it with the nature of things. Yet Heidegger holds\nthat man's requirement\nof truth is the basis of the relation\nof man to things and that this relation occurs as history.

It is an analysis suggesting that the continuity be-\ntween the two aspects of thought\nwhich is found in the\nmovement of \"coming-into-the-nearness\nof distance\" must\nreflect\na\ncontinuity\nbetween\nthe\napparently\ndifferent\ngrounds\nof these aspects, that\nis, between\nthat-which-\nregions as such and its nature.\nAs soon as this final analysis is presented it justifies shift-\ning perspective from man to Being. It justifies such state-\nments as \"Truth's\nnature can come forth independently of\nman only because the nature\nof man\n(as releasement\nto\nthat-v. hich-regions)\nis used by that-which-regions\nin re-\ngioning both with respect to man and to sustain determin-\ning. Evidently truth's independence from\nman is a relation\nto human nature, a relation which rests on the regioning\nof human\nnature\ninto that-which-regions.\n,,26 It justifies\nasking such a question as, \"Yet what then would be the\nnature\nof thinking\nif that-which-regions\nis the nearness\nof distance ?,,27 From the perspective afforded by this final\nanalysis, one is able to see man's nature, the nature of think-\ning,\nas determined\nby Being, as \".\n. . the\nessentially\nhuman relation to that-which-regions.\n. . .,,28 Evidently\nwe stand here in the midst of the ultimate, having stepped\nbeyond our subjective human perspective-yet\na word of\ncaution is necessary!

We may understand the significance of this caution\nif we recall that it is the continuity,\nattained in the inter-\nweaving in thinking\nof opening and openness on the one\nhand, and the resolve for truth on the other, that provides\nthe final step to Being. We may be inclined to forget, in\nthe intoxicating moment when we stand on this step, that\nthe continuity achieved is specific and particular, that it is\njust that continuity\nwhich it is, and that it probably will\nvanish. If we forget this, we shall forget,\ntoo, that\nthe\ncontinuity of thinking as specific and particular must reflect\nsomething\nspecific and\nparticular\nabout\nthe\nmovement\nidentifying that-which-regions\nas such and its nature, some-\nthing of the vanishing which is an aspect of Being.\nJOHN M.

In these\nsounds the artist himself is present; for the master's pres-\nence in the work is the only true presence. The greater the\nmaster, the more completely his person vanishes behind his\nwork.\nThe musicians and singers who take part in today's cele-\nbration are a warrant\nthat Conradin Kreutzer's work will\ncome to be heard on this occasion.\nBut does this alone constitute a memorial celebration?\nA memorial celebration means that we think back, that we\nthink. Yet what are we to think and to say at a memorial\nwhich is devoted to a composer? Is it not the distinction of\nmusic to \"speak\" through the 'sounding of tones and so not\nto need ordinary language, the language of words? So they\nsay. And yet the question remains: Do playing and singing\nalone make our celebration a thoughtful\ncelebration, one in\nwhich we think? Hardly! And so a \"memorial address\" has\nbeen put on the program. It is to help us to think back both\nto the composer we honor and to his work. These memories\ncome alive as soon as we relate\nthe story of Conradin\nKreutzer's\nlife,\nand\nrecount\nand\ndescribe\nhis\nworks.\nThrough\nsuch a relating we can find much that is joyful\nand sorrowful, much that is instructive and exemplary. But\nat bottom we merely allow ourselves to be entertained\nby\nsuch a talk. In listening to such a story, no thinking\nat all\nis needed, no reflecting\nis demanded\non what\nconcerns\neach one of us immediately\nand continuously in his very\nbeing. Thus even a memorial address gives no assurance\nthat we will think at a memorial celebration.\nLet us not fool ourselves. All of us, including those who\nthink professionally, as it were, are often enough thought-\nMEMORIAL\nADDRESS\n45\npoor; we all are far too easily thought-less. Thoughtlessness\nis an uncanny\nvisitor who comes and goes everywhere\nin\ntoday's world. For nowadays we take in everything in the\nquickest and cheapest way, only to forget it just as quickly,\ninstantly.\nThus one gathering\nfollows on the heels of an-\nother. Commemorative celebrations grow poorer and poorer\nin thought. Commemoration and thoughtlessness are found\nside by side.\nBut even while we are thoughtless,\nwe do not give up\nour capacity to think. We rather use this capacity implicitly,\nthough strangely:\nthat is, in thoughtlessness we let it lie\nfallow. Still only that can lie fallow which in itself is a\nground for growth, such as a field. An expressway, where\nnothing\ngrows, cannot be a fallow field. Just as we can\ngrow deaf only because we hear, just as we can grow old\nonly because we were young; so we can grow thought-poor\nor even thought-less\nonly because man at the core of his\nbeing has the capacity to think;\nhas \"spirit\nand reason\"\nand is destined to think. We can only lose or, as the phrase\ngoes, get loose from that which we knowingly or unknow-\ningly possess.\nThe\ngrowing\nthoughtlessness\nmust,\ntherefore,\nspring\nfrom some process that gnaws at the very marrow of man\ntoday: man today is in flight from\nthinking.\nThis flight-\nfrom-thought\nis the ground of thoughtlessness. But part of\n.this flight is that man will neither\nsee nor admit it. Man\ntoday will even flatly deny this flight from thinking.\nHe\nwill assert the opposite. He will say-and\nquite rightly-\nthat there were at no time such far-reaching\nplans, so many\ninquiries in so many areas, research carried on as passion-\nately as today. Of course. And this display of ingenuity and\n"

This\nassertion is valid in the sense that the approaching tide of\ntechnological revolution in the atomic age could so capti-\nvate,\nbewitch,\ndazzle, and beguile\nman\nthat\ncalculative\nthinking\nmay someday come to be accepted and practiced\nas the only way of thinking.\nWhat\ngreat\ndanger\nthen might\nmove upon us?
