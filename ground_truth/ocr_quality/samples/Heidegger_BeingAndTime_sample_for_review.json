Adverbs, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions \nare made to do service as nouns; words which have undergone a long \nhistory of semantical change are used afresh in their older senses; spec\u00ad\nialized modem idioms are generalized far beyond the limits within which \nthey would ordinarily be applicable. Puns are by no means uncommon \nand frequently a key-word may be used in several senses, successively or \neven simultaneously. He is especially fond of ringing the changes on \nwords with a common stem or a common prefix. He tends on the whole \nto avoid personal constructions, and often uses abstract nouns ('Dasein', \n'Zeitlichkeit', 'Sorge', 'ln-der-Welt-sein', and so forth) as subjects of \nsentences where a personal subject would ordinarily be found. Like \nAristotle or Wittgenstein, he likes to talk about his words, and seldom \nmakes an innovation without explaining it; but sometimes he will have \nused a word in a special sense many times before he gets round to the \nexplanation; and he may often use it in the ordinary senses as well. In \nsuch cases the reader is surely entitled to know what word Heidegger is \nactually talking about, as well as what he says about it; and he is also \nentitled to know when and how he actually uses it. \nWe have tried in the main to keep our vocabulary under control, \nproviding a German-English glossary for the more important expres\u00ad\nsions, and a rather full analytical index which will also serve as an English\u00ad\nGerman glossary. We have tried to use as few English terms as possible \nto represent the more important German ones, and we have tried not to \nto use these for other purposes than those we have specifically indicated. \nSometimes we have had to coin new terms to correspond to Heidegger's. \nIn a number of cases there are two German terms at the author's disposal \nwhich he has chosen to differentiate, even though they may be synonyms \nin ordinary German usage; if we have found only one suitable English \nterm to correspond to them, we have sometimes adopted the device of \ncapitalizing it when it represents the German word to which it is etymo\u00ad\nlogically closer: thus 'auslegen' becomes 'interpret', but 'interpretieren' \nbecomes 'Interpret'; 'gliedern' becomes 'articulate', but 'artikulieren' \nbecomes 'Articulate'; 'Ding' becomes 'Thing', but 'thing' represents \n'Sache' and a number of other expressions. In other cases we have coined \na new term. Thus while 'tatsiichlich' becomes 'factual', we have intro\u00ad\nduced 'factical' to represent 'faktisch'. We have often inserted German \nexpressions in square brackets on the occasions of their first appearance \nor on that of their official definition. But we have also used bracketed \nexpressions to call attention to departures from our usual conventions, or \nto bring out etymological connections which might otherwise be over\u00ad\nlooked. \n"

We have not hesitated to quote German \nsentences at length when they have been ambiguous or obscure; while we \nhave sometimes taken pains to show where the ambiguity lies, we have \nmore often left this to the reader to puzzle out for himself. We have often \nquoted passages with verbal subtlbties which would otherwise be lost in \ntranslation. We have also called attention to a number of significant \ndifferences between the earlier and later editions of Heidegger's work. \nThe entire book was reset for the seventh edition; while revisions were by \nno means extensive, they went beyond the simple changes in punctuation \nand citation which Heidegger mentions in hiS preface. We have chosen the \nthird edition (1931) as typical of the earlier editions, and the eighth \n(1957) as typical of the later ones. In general we have preferred the read\u00ad\nings of the eighth edition, and our marginal numbering and cross-references \nfollow its pagination. Heidegger's very valuable footnotes have been \nrenumbered with roman numerals and placed at the end of the text \nwhere we trust they will be given the attention they deserve. Hoping that \nour own notes will be of immediate use to the reader, we have placed \nthem at the bottoms of pages for easy reference, indicating them with \narabic numerals. \nIn general we have tried to stick to the text as closely as we can without \nsacrificing intelligibility; but we have made numerous concessions to the \nreader at the expense of making Heidegger less Heideggerian. We have, \nfor instance, frequently used personal constructions where Heidegger has \navoided them. We have also tried to be reasonably flexible in dealing with \nhyphenated expressions. Heidegger does not seem to be especially con\u00ad\nsistent in his use of quotation marks, though in certain expressions (for \ninstance, the word 'Welt') they are very deliberately employed. Except in \na few footnote references and some of the quotations from Hegel and \nCount Yorck in the two concluding chapters, our single quotation marks \nrepresent Heidegger's double ones. But we have felt free to introduce \ndouble ones of our own wherever we feel that they may be helpful to \nthe reader. We have followed a similar policy with regard to italicization. \nWhen Heidegger uses italics in the later editions (or spaced type in the \nearlier ones), we have generally used italics; but in the relatively few cases \nwhere we have felt that some emphasis of our own is needed, we have \nresorted to wide spacing. We have not followed Heidegger in the use of \nitalics for proper names or for definite articles used demonstratively to \nintroduce restrictive relative clauses. But we have followed the usual \npractice of italicizing words and phrases from languages other than English \n"

We, however, who used to think we under\u00ad\nstood it, have now become perplexed.'1 \nDo we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really \nmean by the word 'being' ?1 Not at all. So it is fitting that we should \nraise anew the question of the meaning2 of Being. But are we nowadays even \nperplexed at our inability to understand the expression 'Being'? Not at \nall. So first of all we must reawaken an understanding for the meaning of \nthis question. Our aim in the following treatise is to work out the question \nof the meaning of Being and to do so concretely. Our provisional aim \nis the Interpretation3 of time as the possible horizon for any understanding \nwhatsoever of Being.' \nBut the reasons for making this our aim, the investigations which such \na purpose requires, and the path to its achievement, call for some intro\u00ad\nductory remarks. \n1 'seiend'. Heidegger translates Plato's present participle ov by this present participle \nof the verb 'sein' ('to be'). We accordingly translate 'seiend' here and in a number of \nlater passages by the present participle 'being'; where such a translation is inconvenient \nwe shall resort to other constructions, usually subjoining the German word in brackets or \nin a footnote. The 'participle 'seiend' must be distinguished from the infinitive 'sein', \nwhich we shall usually translate either by the infinitive 'to be' or by the gerund 'being'. \nIt must also be distinguished from the important substantive 'Sein' (always capitalized), \nwhich we shall translate as 'Being' (capitalized), and from the equally important sub\u00ad\nstantive 'Seiendes', which is directly derived from 'seiend', and which we shall usually \ntranslate as 'entity' or 'entities'. (See our note 6, H. 3 below.) \n2 'Sinn.' In view of the importance of the distinction between 'Sinn' and 'Bedeutung' \nin German writers as diverse as Dilthey, Husser!, Frege and Schlick, we shall translate \n'Sinn' by 'meaning' or 'sense', depending on the context, and keep 'signification' and \n'signify' for 'Bedeutung' and 'bedeuten'. (The verb 'mean' will occasionally be used to \ntranslate such verbs as 'besagen', 'sagen', 'heissen' and 'meinen', but the noun 'meaning' \nwill be reserved for 'Sinn'.) On 'Sinn', see H. 151, 324; on 'Bedeutung', etc., see H. 87, \nand our note 47 ad loc. \n3 Heidegger uses two words which might well be translated as 'interpretation': 'Aus\u00ad\nlegung' and 'Interpretation'. Though in many cases these may be regarded as synonyms, \ntheir connotations are not quite the same. 'Auslegung' seems to be used in a broad sense \nto cover any activity in which we interpret something 'as' something, whereas 'Inter\u00ad\npretation' seems to apply to interpretations which are more theoretical or systematic, as \nin the exegesis of a text. See especially H. 148 ff. and 199 f. We shall preserve this distinc\u00ad\ntion by writing 'interpretation' for 'Auslegung', but 'Interpretation' fo.r Heidegger's \n'Interpretation', following similar conventions for the verbs 'auslegen' and 'interpretieren'. \n4 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n als des miiglichen Horizontes eines jeden Seinsverstiindnisses iiberhaupt . .  .' \nThroughout this work the word 'horizon' is used with a connotation somewhat different \nfrom that to which the English-speaking reader is likely to be accustomed. We tend to \nthink of a horizon as something which we may widen or extend or go beyond; Heidegger, \nhowever, seems to think of it rather as something which we can neither widen nor go \nbeyond, but which provides the limits for certain intellectual activities performed 'within' it. \n"

We shall therefore carry the dis\u00ad\ncussion of these presuppositions only to the point at which the necessity \nfor restating the question about the meaning of Being become plain. \nThere are three such presuppositions. \n1 .  First, it has been maintained that 'Being' is the 'most universal' \nconcept: To ov Jan Ka86>-.ov p.aAtUTa 7TaVTwv.1 lllud quod primo cadit sub \napprehensione est ens, cuius intellectus includitur in omnibus, quaecumque quis \napprehendit. 'An understanding of Being is already included in conceiving \nanything which one apprehends as an entity.'1\u202211 But the 'universality' of \n'Being' is not that of a class or genus. The term 'Being' does not define that \nrealm of entities which is uppermost when these are Articulated con\u00ad\nceptually according to genus and species: oiJT\u00a3 To ov ylvos.m The 'univer\u00ad\nsality' of Being 'transcends' any universality of genus. In medieval ontology \n'Being' is designated as a 'transcendens'. Aristotle himself knew the unity of \nthis transcendental 'universal' as a unitp of analogy in contrast to the \nmultiplicity of the highest generic concepts applicable to things. With \nthis discovery, in spite of his dependence on the way in which the \nontological question had been formulated by Plato, he put the problem \nof Being on what was, in principle, a new basis. To be sure, even Aristotle \nfailed to clear away the darkness of these categorial interconnections. In \nmedieval ontology this problem was widely discussed, especially in the \nThomist and Scotist schools, without reaching clarity as to principles. \nAnd when Hegel at last defines 'Being' as the 'indeterminate immediate' \nand makes this definition basic for all the further categorial explications \nof his 'logic', he keeps looking in the same direction as ancient ontology, \n1 ' \" \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n was einer am Seienden erfasst\" '. The word 'Seiendes\u00b7, which Heidegger uses \nin his paraphrase, is one of the most important words in the book. The substantive 'das \nSeiende' is derived from the participle 'seiend' (see note 1, p. tg), and means literally \n'that which is'; 'ein Seiendes' means 'somet)ling which is'. There is much to be said for \ntranslating 'Seiendes' by the noun 'being' or 'beings' (for it is often used in a collective \nsense). We feel, however, that it is smoother and less confusing to write 'entity' or 'en\u00ad\ntities'. We are well aware that in recent British and American philosophy the term \n'entity' has been used more generally to apply to almost anything whatsoever, no matter \nwhat its ontological status. In this translation, however, it will mean simply 'something \nwhich if'. An alternative translation of the Latin quotation is given by the English \nDominican Fathers, Summa Theologica, Thomas Baker, London, 1915: 'For that which, \nbefore aught else, falls under apprehension, is being, the notion of which is included in all \nthings whatsoever a man apprehends.' \n"

So if it is said that 'Being' is the most universal concept, this \ncannot mean that it is the one which is clearest or that it needs no further \ndiscussion. It is rather the darkest of al. \n2. It has been maintained secondly that the concept of 'Being' is \n4 \nindefinable. This is deduced from its supreme universality,tv and rightly \nso, if de.finitio fit per genus proximum et diferentiam specijicam. 'Being' cannot \nindeed be conceived as an entity; enti non additur aliqua natura: nor can it \nacquire such a character as to have the term \"entity\" applied to it. \n\"Being\" cannot be derived from higher concepts by definition, nor can \nit be presented through lower ones. But does this imply that 'Being' no \nlonger offers a problem? Not at all. We can infer only that 'Being' cannot \nhave the character of an entity. Thus we cannot apply to Being the concept \nof 'definition' as presented in traditional logic, which itself has its founda\u00ad\ntions in ancient ontology and which, within certain limits, provides a \nquite justifiable way of' defining \"entities\". The indefinability of Being \ndoes not eliminate the question of its meaning; it demands that we look \nthat question in the face. \n3\u00b7 Thirdly, it is held that 'Being' is of all concepts the one that is self\u00ad\nevident. Whenever one cognizes anything or makes an assertion, whenever \none comports oneself towards entities, even towards oneself, 1 some use \nis made of 'Being'; and this expression is held to be intelligible 'without \nfurther ado', just as everyone understands \"The sky is blue', 'I am merry', \nand the like. But here we have an average kind of intelligibility, which \nmerely demonstrates that this is unintelligible. It makes manifest that in \nany way of comporting oneself towards entities as entities-even in any \nBeing towards entities as entities-there lies a priori an enigma. 2 The very \nfact that we already live in an understanding of Being and that the mean\u00ad\ning of Being is still veiled in darkness proves that it is necessary in principle \nto raise this question again. \nWithin the rangeof basic philosophical concepts-especiallywhen we come \nto the concept of 'Being'-it is a dubious procedure to invoke self-evidence, \neven if the 'self-evident' (Kant's 'covert judgments of the common reason') 3 \n1 ' .\n.\n\u2022\n in jedem Verhalten zu Seiendem, in jedem Sich-zu-sich-selbst-verhalten .. .' \nThe verb 'verhalten' can refer to any kind of behaviour or way of conducting onest;lf, \neven to the way in which one relates oneself to something else, or to the way one reframs \nor holds oneself back. We shall translate it in various ways. \n2 'Sie macht offenbar, dass in jedem Verhalten und Sein zu Seiendem als Seiendem a \npriori ein Ratsel liegt.' The phrase 'Sein zu Seiendem' is typical of many similar expressions \nin which the substantive 'Sein' is followed by the preposition 'zu'. In such expressions \nwe shall usually translate 'zu' as 'towards': for example, 'Being-towards-death', 'Being \ntowards Others', 'Being towards entities within-the-world'. \n3 '  \"die geheimen Urteile der gemeinen Vernunft\" '. \n"

So if it is to be revived, this means that \nwe must first work out an adequate way offormulating it. \n5 \nv 2. The Formal Structure of the Question of Being \nThe question of the meaning of Being must be formulated. If it is a \nfundamental question, or indeed the fundamental question, it must be \nmade transparent, and in an appropriate way. 1 We must therefore \nexplain briefly what belongs to any question whatsoever, so that from this \nstandpoint the question of Being can be made visible as a very special one \nwith its own distinctive character. \nEvery inquiry is a seeking [Suchen]. Every seeking gets guided before\u00ad\nhand by what is sought. Inquiry is a cognizant seeking for an entity both \nwith regard to the fact t h a t  it is and with regard to its Being as it is. 2 \nThis cognizant seeking can take the form of ' investigating' [\"Untersuchen\"], \nin which one lays bare that which the question is about and ascertains its \ncharacter. Any inquiry, as an inquiry about something, has that which is \nasked about [sein Gefragtes]. But all inquiry about something is somehow a \nquestioning of something [Anfragen bei . . .  ]. So in addition to what is \nasked about, an inquiry has that which is interrogated [ein Befragtes]. In \ninvestigative questions-that is, in questions which are specifically theo\u00ad\nretical-what is asked about is determined and conceptualized. Further\u00ad\nmore, in what is asked about there lies also that which is to be found out by \nthe asking [das Erjragte] ; this is what is really intended:3 with this the \ninquiry reaches its goal. Inquiry itself is the behaviour of a questioner, and \ntherefore of an entity, and as such has its own character of Being. When one \nmakes an inquiry one may do so 'just casually' or one may formulate the \n1 ' \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n dann bedarf solches Fragen der angemessenen Durchsichtigkeit'. The adjective \n'durchsichtig' is one of Heidegger's favourite expressions, and means simply 'transparent', \n'perspicuous', something that one can 'see through'. We shall ordinarily translate it by \n'transparent'. See H. 146 for further discussion. \nll ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n in seinem Dass- und Sosein'. \n3 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n das eigentlich Intendierte . . .  ' The adverb 'eigentlich' occurs very often in this \nwork. It may be used informally where one might write 'really' or 'on its part', or in a \nmuch stronger sense, where something like 'genuinely' or 'authentically' would be more \nappropriate. It is not always possible to tell which meaning Heidegger has in mind. In the \ncontexts which seem relatively informal we shall write 'really'; in the more technical \npassages we shall write 'authentically', reserving 'genuinely' for 'genuin' or 'edit'. The \nreader must not confuse this kind of 'authenticity' with the kind, which belongs to an \n'authentic text' or an 'authentic account'. See H. 42 for further discussion. In the present \npassage, the verb 'intendieren' is presumably used in the medieval sense of 'intending', as \nadapted and modified by Brentano and Husser!. \n"

Hence \nBeing, as that which is asked about, must be exhibited in a way of its own, \nessentially different from the way in which entities are discovered. Accord\u00ad\ningly, what is to be found out by the asking-the meaning of Being-also \ndemands that it be conceived in a way of its own, essentially contrasting \nwith the concepts in which entities acquire their determinate signification. \nIn so far as Being constitutes what is asked about, and \"Being\" means \nthe Being of entities, then entities themselves turn out to be what is inter\u00ad\nrogated.

It is quite impossible for there to be any ' circular \nargument' in formulating the question about the meaning of Being; for \nin answering this question, the issue is not one of grounding something \nby such a derivation; it is rather one of laying bare the grounds for it \nand exhibiting them. 2 \nIn the question of the meaning of Being there is no ' circular reasoning' \nbut rather a remarkable ' relatedness backward or forward' which what \nwe are asking about (Being) bears to the inquiry itself as a mode of Being \nof an entity. Here what is asked about has an essential pertinence to the \ninquiry itself, and this belongs to the ownmost meaning [ eigensten Sinn] \nof the question of Being. This only means, however, that there is a way\u00ad\nperhaps even a very special one-in which entities with the character of \nDasein are related to the question of Being.

'Verfassung' is the standard word for the 'constitution' of a \nnation or any political organization, but it is also used for the 'condition' or 'state' in \nwhich a person may find himself. Heidegger seldom uses the word in either of these senses; \nbut he does use it in ways which are somewhat analogous. In one sense Dasein's 'Ver\u00ad\nfassung' is its 'constitution', the way it is constituted, 'sa condition humaine'. In another \nsense Dasein may have several 'Verfassungen' as constitutive 'states' or factors which \nenter into its 'constitution'. We shall, in general, translate 'Verfassung' as 'constitution' or \n'constitutive state' according to the context; but in passages where 'constitutive state' \nwould be cumbersome and there is little danger of ambiguity, we shall simply write \n'state'. These states, however, must always be thought of as constitutive and essential, \nnot as temporary or transitory stages like the 'state' of one's health or the 'state of the \nnation'. When Heidegger uses the word 'Konstitution', we shall usually indicate this by \ncafitalizing 'Constitution'. \n' . . .  weil es in der Beantwortung der Frage nicht um eine ableitende Begrundung, \nsondern um aufweisende Grund-Freilegung geht.'

The relativity theory of p\u04c1sics \narises from the tendency to exhibit the interconnectedness of Nature as \nit is 'in itself'. As a theory of the conditions under which we have access \nto Nature itself, it seeks to preserve the changelessness of the laws of \n10 \nmotion by ascertaining all relativities, and thus comes up against the \nquestion of the structure of its own given area of study-the problem of \nmatter. In biology there is an awakening tendency to inquire beyond the \ndefinitions which mechanism and vitalism have given foF \"life\" and \n\"organism\", and to define anew the kind of Being which belongs to the \nliving as such. In those humane sciences which are historiological in character, 1 \nthe urge towards historical actuality itself has been strengthened in the \ncourse of time by tradition and by the way tradition has been presented \nand handed down : the history of literature is to become the history of \nproblems. Theology is seeking a more primordial interpretation of man's \nBeing towards God, prescribed by the meaning offaith itself and remaining \nwithin it. It is slowly beginning to understand once more Luther's insight \nthat the 'foundation' on which its system of dogma rests has not arisen \nfrom an inquiry in which faith is primary, and that conceptually this \n'foundation' not only is inadequate for the problematic of theology, but \nconceals and distorts it. \nBasic concepts determine the way in which we get an understanding \nbeforehand of the area of subject-matter underlying all the objects a \nscience takes as its theme, and all positive investigation is guided by this \nunderstanding. Only after the area itself has been explored beforehand \nin a corresponding manner do these concepts become genuinely demon\u00ad\nstrated and 'grounded'. But since every such area is itself obtained from \nthe domain of entities themselves, this preliminary research, from which \nthe basic concepts are drawn, signifies nothing else than an interpretation \nof those entities with regard to their basic state of Being. Such research \nmust run ahead of the positive sciences, and it can. Here the work of Plato \nand Aristotle is evidence enough. Laying the foundations for the sciences \nin this way is different in principle from the kind of 'logic' which limps \nalong after, investigating the status of some science as it chances to find \nit, in order to discover its 'method'.

As ways in which man behaves, \nsciences have the manner of Being which this entity-man himself- pos\u00ad\nsesses. This entity we denote by the term \"Dasein\". Scientific research is \nnot the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the \none which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness \n12 \nas compared with other entities, and it is worth our while to bring this to \nview in a provisional way. Here our discussion must anticipate later \nanalyses, in which our results will be authentically exhibited for the first time. \nDasein is an entity which does not just occur among other entities. \nRather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, \nthat Being is an issue for it. But in that case, this is a constitutive state of \nDasein's Being, and this implies that Dasein, in its Being, has a relation\u00ad\nship towards that Being-a relationship which itself is one of Being. 2 And \nthis means further that there is some way in which Dasein understands \nitself in its Being, and that to some degree it does so explicitly. It is pecu\u00ad\nliar to this entity that with and through its Being, this Being is disclosed \nto it. Understanding of Being is itself a definite characteristic of Dasein's Being. \nDasein is ontically distinctive in that it is ontological. 3 \nHere \"Being-ontological\" is not yet tantamount to \"developing an \nontology\". So if we should reserve the term \"ontology\" for that theoreti\u00ad\ncal inquiry which is explicitly devoted to the meaning of entities, then what \nwe have had in mind in speaking of Dasein's \"Being-ontological\" is to be \ndesignated as something \"pre-ontological\". It does not signify simply \n\"being-ontical\", however, but rather \"being in such a way that one has \nan understanding of Being\". \nThat kind of Being towards which Dasein can comport itself in one \nway or another, and always does comport itself somehow, we call \"exis\u00ad\ntence\" [Existen\u04c2]. And because we cannot define Dasein's essence by citing \na \"what\" of the kind that pertains to a subject-matter [eines sachhaltigen \nWas], and because its essence lies rather in the fact that in each case it \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n das Ganze eines Begriindungszusammenhanges wahrer Satze . . .  \n' See H. 357 \nbelow. \n2 'Zu dieser Seinsverfassung des Daseins gehort aber dann, dass es in seinem Sein zu \ndiesem Sein ein Seinsverhaltnis hat.'

As 'ontologisch' may be either an adjective or an \nadverb, we might also write : ' . . .  that it is ontologically'.

The task of an existential \nanalytic of Dasein has been delineated in 11dvance, as regards both its \n13 \npossibility and its necessity, in Dasein's ontical constitution. \nSo far as existence is the determining character of Dasein, the onto\u00ad\nlogical analytic of this entity always requires that existentiality be con\u00ad\nsidered beforehand. By \"existentiality\" we understand the state of Being \nthat is constitutive for those entities that exist. But in the idea of such a \nconstitutive state of Being, the idea of Being is already included. And thus \neven the possibility of carrying through the analytic ofDasein depends on \nworking out beforehand the question about the meaning of Being in general. \nSciences are ways of Being in which Dasein comports itself towards \nentities which it need not be itself. But to Dasein, Being in a world is \nsomething that belongs essentially. Thus Dasein's understanding of Being \npertains with equal primordiality both to an understanding of something \nlike a 'world', and to the understanding of the Being of those entities \nwhich become accessible within the world.a So whenever an ontology \ntakes for its theme entities whose character of Being is other than that of \nDasein, it has its own foundation and motivation in Dasein's own ontical \nstructure, in which a pre-ontological understanding of Being is comprised \nas a definite characteristic. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n class es je sein Sein als seiniges zu sein hat . . .

I \nTherefore fundamental ontology, from which alone all other ontologies \ncan take their rise, must be sought in the existential analytic of Dasein. \nDasein accordingly takes priority over all other entities in several ways. \nThe first priority is an ontical one : Dasein is an entity whose Being has the \ndeterminate character of existence. The second priority is an ontological \none : Dasein is in itself'ontological', because existence is thus determinative \nfor it. But with equal primordiality Dasein also possesses-as constitutive \nfor its understanding of existence-an understanding of the Being of all \nentities of a character other than its own. Dasein has therefore a third \npriority as providing the ontico-ontological condition for the possibility \nof any ontologies. Thus Dasein has turned out to be, more than any other \nentity, the one which must first be interrogated ontologically. \nBut the roots of the existential analytic, on its part, are ultimately \nexistentiell, that is, ontical. Only if the inquiry of philosophical research is \nitself seized upon in an existentiell manner as a possibility of the Being \nof each existing Dasein, does it become at all possible to disclose the \nexistentiality of existence and to undertake an adequately founded onto-\n14 \nlogical problematic. But with this, the ontical priority of the question of \nbeing has also become plain. \nDasein's ontico-ontological priority was seen quite early, though \nDasein itself was not grasped in its genuine ontological structure, and did \nnot even become a problem in which this structure was sought. Aristotle \nsa<ys : \u0131 !fvx- -ra ov-ra TTW> lcmv.vl \"Man's soul is, in a certain way, \nentities.\" The 'soul' which makes up the Being of man has ata87JCM and \nvo7JC1t> among its ways of Being, and in these it discovers all entities, both \nin the fact t h a t  they are, and in their Being as they are-that is, always \nin their Being. Aristotle's principle, which points back to the ontological \nthesis of Parmenides, is one which Thomas Aquinas has taken up in a \ncharacteristic discussion. Thomas is engaged in the task of deriving the \n'transcendentia'-those characters of Being which lie beyond every possible \nway in which an entity may be classified as coming under some generic \nkind of subject-matter (every modus specialis entis), and which belong \nnecessarily to anything, whatever it may be. Thomas has to demonstrate \nthat the verum is such a transcendens. He does this by invoking an entity \nwhich, in accordance with its very manner of Being, is properly suited \nto 'come together with' entities of any sort whatever. This distinctive \nentity, the ens quod natum est convenire cum omni ente, is the soul (anima).v11 \nHere the priority of 'Dasein' over all other entities emerges, although it \nhas not been ontologically clarified. This priority has obviously nothing \nin common with a vicious subjectivizing of the totality of entities. \nBy indicating Dasein's ontico-ontological priority in this provisional \n"

The kind of Being which belongs to Dasein is rather such \nthat, in understanding its own Being, it has a tendency to do so in terms \nof that entity towards which it comports itself proximally and in a way \nwhich is essentially constant-in terms of the 'world'.

These difficulties are not grounded in any short\u00ad\ncomings of the cognitive powers with which we are endowed, or in the \nlack of a suitable way of conceiving-a lack which seemingly would not \nbe hard to remedy. \nNot only, however, does an understanding of Being belong to Dasein; \nbut this understanding develops or decays along with whatever kind of \nBeing Dasein may possess at the time ; accordingly there are many ways in \nwhich it has been interpreted, and these are all at Dasein's (lisposal. \nDasein's ways of behaviour, its capacities, powers, possibilities, and vicis\u00ad\nsitudes, have been studied with varying extent in philosophical psychology, \nin anthropology, ethics, and 'political science', in poetry, biography, and \nthe writingof history,each in a different fashion.

Thus by having \nregard\u2022for the basic state of Dasein's everydayness, we shall bring out the \nBeing of this entity in a preparatory fashion. \nWhen taken in this way, the analytic ofDasein remains wholly oriented \ntowards the guiding task of working out the question of Being. Its limits \nare thus determined. It cannot attempt to provide a complete ontology of \nDasein, which assuredly must be constructed if anything like a 'philo\u00ad\nsophical' anthropology is to have a philosophically adequate basis. 2 \nIf our purpose is to make such an anthropology possible, or to lay its \nontological foundations, our Interpretation will provide only some of the \n'pieces', even though they are by no means inessential ones. Our \nanalysis of Dasein, however, is not only incomplete ; it is also, in the first \ninstance, provisional. It merely brings out the Being of this entity, without \nInterpreting its meaning. It is rather a preparatory procedure by which \nthe horizon for the most primordial way of interpreting Being may be \nlaid bare. Once we have arrived at that horizon, this preparatory analytic \nof Dasein will have to be repeated on a higher and authentically onto\u00ad\nlogical basis. \nWe shall point to temporality3 as the meaning of the Being of that entity \nwhich we call \"Dasein\". If this is to be demonstrated, those structures of \nDasein which we shall provisionally exhibit must be Interpreted over \nagain as niodes of temporality.

On 'zunachst' see our note 1, p. 25, H. 6. \n2 The ambiguity of the pronominal references in this sentence and the one before it, \nreflects a similar ambiguity in the German. (The English-speaking reader should be \nreminded that the kind of philosophical 'anthropology' which Heidegger has in mind \nis a study of man in the widest sense, and is not to be confused with the empirical sciences \nof 'physical' and 'cultural' anthropology.) \n3 ',Zeitlichkeit'. 'While it is tempting to translate the adjective 'zeitlich' and the noun \n'Zeitlichkeit' by their most obvious English cognates, 'timely' and 'timeliness', this would \nbe entirely misleading; for 'temporal' and 'temporality' come much closer to what \nHeidegger has in mind, not only when he is discussing these words in their popular \nsenses (as he does on the following page) but even when he is using them in his own special \nsense, as in Section 65 below. (See especially H. 326 below, where 'Zeitlichkeit' is defined.) \nOn the other hand, he occasionally uses the noun 'Temporalitat' and the adjective \n'temporal' in a sense which he will explain later (H. 19). We shall translate these by \n'Temporality' and 'Temporal', with initial capitals. \n"

Time must be brought to light-and genuinely \nconceived-as the horizon for all understanding of Being and for any \nway of interpreting it. In order for us to discern this, time needs to be \nexplicated primordially as the horizon for the understanding of Being, and in terms \nof temporality as the Being of Dasein, which understands Being. This task as a \nwhole requires that the conception of time thus obtained shall be dis\u00ad\ntinguished from the way in which it is ordinarily understood. This \nordinary way of understanding it has become explicit in an interpretation \n18 \nprecipitated in the traditional concept of time, which has persisted from \nAristotle to Bergson and even later. Here we must make clear that this \nconception of time and, in general, the ordinary way of understanding it, \nhave sprung from temporality, and we must show how this has come \nabout.

This omission was \na decisive one in the spirit [im Sinne] of Descartes' ownmost Tendencies. \nWith the 'cogito sum' Descartes had claimed that he was putting philo\u00ad\nsophy on a new and firm footing. But what he left undetermined when he \nbegan in this 'radical' way, was the kind of Being which belongs to the \nres cogitans, or-more precisely-the meaning of the Being of the 'sum'.1 By \nworking out the unexpressed ontological foundations of the 'cogito sum', we \nshall complete our sojourn at the second station along the path of our \ndestructive retrospect of the history of ontology. Our Interpretation will \nnot only prove that Descartes had to neglect the question of Being alto\u00ad\ngether; it will also show why he came to suppose that the absolute 'Being\u00ad\ncertain' [\"Gewisssein\"] of the cogito exempted him from raising the ques\u00ad\ntion of the meaning of the Being which this entity possesses. \nYet Descartes not only continued to neglect this and thus to accept a \ncompletely indefinite ontological status for the res cogitans sive mens sive \nanimus ['the thing which cognizes, whether it be a mind or spirit'] : he \nregarded this entity as afundamentum inconcussum, and applied the medieval \nontology to it in carrying through the fundamental considerations of his \nMeditationes. He defined the res cogitans ontologically as an ens; and in the \nmedieval ontology the meaning of Being for such an ens had been fixed \nby understanding it as an ens creatum. God, as ens infinitum, was the ens \ni n  c r e a  t u m. But createdness [Geschaffenheit] in the widest sense of \nsomething's having been produced [Hergestelltheit], was an essential \n25 \nitem in the structure of the ancient conception of Being.

MyE'v \nitself--or rather voEiv, that simple awareness of something present-at-\n26 \nhand in its sheer presence-at-hand, 1 which Parmenides had already taken \nto guide him in his own interpretation of Being-has the Temporal \nstructure of a pure 'making-present' of something.11 Those entities which \nshow themselves i n  this and fo r it, and which are understood as entities \nin the most authentic sense, thus get interpreted with regard to the \nPresent; that is, they are conceived as presence (ovula) .3 \nYet the Greeks have managed to interpret Being in this way without \nany explicit knowledge of the clues which function here, without any \nacquaintance with the fundamental ontological function of time or even \nany understanding of it, and without any insight into the reason why this \nfunction is possible. On the contrary, they take time itself as one entity \namong other entities, and try to grasp it in the structure of its Being, \nthough that way of understanding Being which they have taken as their \nhorizon is one which is itself naively and inexplicitly oriented towards \ntime. \nWithin the framework in which we are about to work out the principles \nof the question of Being, we cannot present a detailed Temporal Inter\u00ad\npretation of the foundations of ancient ontology, particularly not of its \nloftiest and purest scientific stage, which is reached in Aristotle. Instead \nwe shall give an interpretation of Aristotle's essay on time, 11 which may \nbe chos\u00eb as providing a way of discriminating the basis and the limitations \nof the ancient science of Being. \nAristotle's essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n von etwas Vorhandenem in seiner puren Vorhandenheit . .  .' The adjective \n'vorhanden' means literally 'betorGthe hand', but this signification has long since given \nway to others. In ordinary German usage it may, for instance, be applied to the stock of \ngoods which a dealer has 'on hand', or to the 'extant' works of an author; and in earlier \nphilosophical writing it could be used, like the word 'Dasein' itself, as a synonym for the \nLatin 'existentia'. Heidegger, however, distinguishes quite sharply between 'Dasein' and \n'Vorhandenheit', using the latter to designate a kind of Being which belongs to things \nother than Dasein. We shall translate 'vorhanden' as 'present-at-hand', and 'Vorhanden\u00ad\nheit' as 'presence-at-hand'. The reader must be careful not to confuse these expressions \nwith our 'presence' ('Anwesenheit') and 'the Present' ('die Gegenwart'), etc., or with a \nfew other verbs\u00dfd adjectives which we may find it convenient to translate by 'present'. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n des reinen \"Gegenwiirtigens\" von etwas'. The verb 'gegenwiirtigen', which is \nderived from the adjective 'gegenwiirtig', is not a normal German verb, but was used by \nHuserl and is used extensively by Heidegger. While we shall translate it by various forms \nof 'make present', it does not necessarily mean 'making physically present', but often \nmeans something like 'bringing vividly to mind'. \n3 'Das Seiende, das sich in ihm fiir es zeigt und das als das eigentliche Seiende \nverstanden wird, erhlilt demnach seine Auslegung in Riicksicht auf-Gegen-wart, \nd.h. es ist als Anwesenheit (o!lula) begriffen.' The hyphenation of 'Gegen-wart' calls \nattention to the structure of this word in a way which cannot be reproduced in English. \nSee note 2, p. 47, H. 25 above. The pronouns 'ihm' and 'es' presumably both refer back \nto Mynv, though their reference is ambiguous, as our version suggests. \n"

Thus our treatise does not subscribe to a 'stand\u00ad\n}JOint' or represent any special 'direction'; for phenomenology is nothing \nof either sort, nor can it become so as long as it understands itself. The \nexpression 'phenomenology' signifies primarily a methodological concep\u00ad\ntion. This expression does not characterize the what of the objects of \nphilosophical research as subject-matter, but rather the how of that \nresearch. The more genuinely a methodological concept is worked out \nand the more comprehensively it determines the principles on which a \nscience is to be conducted, all the more primordially is it rooted in the way \nwe come to terms with the things themselves, 1 and the farther is it \nremoved from what we call \"technical devices\", though there are many \n5uch devices even in the theoretical disciplines. \nThus the term 'phenomenology' expresses a maxim which can be for-\n28 \nmulated as 'To the things themselves !' It is opposed to all free-floating \nconstructions and accidental findings ; it is opposed to taking over any \nconceptions which only seem to have been demonstrated; it is opposed \nto those pseudo-questions which parade themselves as 'problems', often \nfor generations at a time. Yet this maxim, one may rejoin, is abundantly \nself-evident, and it expresses, moreover, the underlying principle of any \nscientific knowledge whatsoever. Why should anything so self-evident be \ntaken up explicitly in giving a title to a branch of research ? In point of \nfact, the issue here is a kind of 'self-evidence' which we should like to \nbring closer to us, so far as it is important to do so in casting light upon \nthe procedure of our treatise. We shall expound only the preliminary \nconception [Vorbegriff] of phenomenology. \nThis expression has two components : \"phenomenon\" and \"logos\". \nBoth of these go back to terms fr.pm the Greek : cpaw6p.\u00a3vov and .\\6yoS'. \nTaken superficially, the term \"phenomenology\" is formed like \"theology\", \n\"biology\", \"sociology\"-names which may be translated as \"science of \nGod\", \"science of life\", \"science of society\". This would make pheno\u00ad\nmenology the science qf phenomena. We shall set forth the preliminary con\u00ad\nception of phenomenology by characterizing what one has in mind in the \nterm's two components, 'phenomenon' and 'logos', and by establishing \nthe meaning of the na\u0149e in which these are put together. The history of \n1 The appeal to the 'Sachen selbst', which Heidegger presents as virtually a slogan for \nHusserl's phenomenology, is not easy to translate without giving misleading impressions. \nWhat Husser! has in mind is the 'things' that words may be found to signify when their \nsignifications are correctly intuited by the right kind of Anschauung. (Cf. his Logische \nUntersuchungen, vol. 2, part 1, second edition, Halle, 1913, p. 6.) We have followed Marvin \nFarber in adopting 'the things themselves'. (Cf. his The Foundation of Phenomenology, \nCambridge, Mass., 1943, pp. 202-3.) The word 'Sache' will, of course, be translated in \nother ways also. \n"

      "full_text": "Being and Time \nINT. II \nThis is what one is talking about when one speaks of the 'symptoms of \na disease' [\"Krankheitserscheinungen\"]. Here one has in mind certain \noccurrences in the body which show themselves and which, in showing \nthemselves a s thus showing themselves, 'indicate' [\"indizieren\"] some\u00ad\nthing which does not show itself. The emergence [Auftreten] of such \noccurrences, their showing-themselves, goes together with the Being\u00ad\npresent-at-hand of disturbances which do not show themselves. Thus \nappearance, as the appearance 'of something', does not mean showing\u00ad\nitself; it means rather the announcing-itself by [von] something which \ndoes not show itself, but which announces itself through something which \ndoes show itself. Appearing is a not-showing-itself. But the 'not' we find \nhere is by no means to be confused with the privative \"not\" which we \nused in defining the structure of semblance.1 What appears does not show \nitself; and anything which thus fails to show itself, is also something which \ncan never s e e m .2 All indications, presentations, symptoms, and symbols \nhave this basic formal structure of appearing, even though they differ \namong themselves. \nrespect for the translator, the passage shows some signs of hasty constructicm, and a few \ncomments may be helpful. We are told several times that 'appearance' and 'phenome\u00ad\nnon' are to be sharply distinguished; yet we are also reminded that there is a sense in \nwhich they coincide, and even this sense seems to be twofold, though it is not clear that \nHeidegger is fully aware of this. The whole discussion is based upon two further distinc\u00ad\ntions : the distinction between 'showing' ('zeigen') and 'announcing' ('melden') and \n'bringing forth' ('hervorbringen'), and the distinction between ('x') that which 'shows \nitself' ('das Sichzeigende') or which 'does the announcing' ('das Meldende') or which \n'gets brought forth' ('das Hervorgebrachte'), and ()!') that which 'announces itself' \n('das Sichmeldende') or which does the bringing-forth. Heidegger is thus able to intro\u00ad\nduce the following senses of 'Erscheinung' or 'appearance' :  \n1a. an observable eventy, such a s  a symptom whi\u00c9 announces a disease x by showing \nitself, and in or through which x announces itself without showing itself; \n1 b. y's showing-itself; \n, \n2. \nx's announcing-itself in or through y; \n3a. the 'mere appearance' y which x may /iring jOTth when x is of such a kind that its \nreal nature can ntver be made manifest; \n3b. the 'mere appearance' which is the bringing-forth of a 'mere appearance' in sense 3a. \nHeidegger makes abundantly clear that sense 2 is the proper sense of 'appearance' and \nthat senses 3a and 3b are the proper senses of 'mere appearance'. On H. 30 and 31 he \nconcedes that sense 1b corresponds to the primordial sense of 'phenomenon' ;  but his \ndiscussion on H. 28 suggests that 1a corresponds to this more accurately, and he reverts \nto this position towards the end of H. 30. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n als welches es die Struktur des Scheins bestimmt.' (The older editions omit \nthe 'es'.) \n2 'Was sich in der Weise nicht zeigt, wie das Erscheinende, kann auch nie scheinen.' \nThis passage is ambiguous, but presumably 'das Erscheinende' is to be interpreted as the \nx of our note 1, p. 51, not our y. The reader should notice that our standardized transla\u00ad\ntion of 'scheinen' as 'seem' is one which her\u00ca becomes rather misleading, even though \nthese words correspond fairly well in ordinary usage. In distinguishing between 'scheinen' \nand 'erscheinen', Heidegger seems to be insisting that 'scheinen' can be done only by \nthe y which 'shows itself' or 'does the announcing', not by the x which 'announces \nitself' in or throughy, even though German usage does not differentiate these verbs quite \nso sharply. \n"

If, as has \nbecome quite customary nowadays, one defines \"truth\" as something that \n'really' pertains to judgment, 2 and if one then invokes the support of \nAristotle with this thesis, not only is this unjustified, but, above all, the \nGreek conception of truth has been misunderstood. A'ta87Ja'iS', the sheer \nsensory perception of something, is 'true' in the Greek sense, and indeed \nmore primordially than the AoyoS' which we have been discussing. Just \nas seeing aims at colours, any a'ta87JU\u00a3S' aims at its 't8\u00a3a (those entities \nwhich are genuinely accessible only through it and for it) ; and to that \nextent this perception is always true.

This voE'iv can never cover up; it can never be false ; it can at \nworst remain a non-perceiving, ayvo\u00a3'iv, not sufficing for straightforward \nand appropriate access. \nWhen something no longer takes the form of just letting something be \n34 \nseen, but is always harking back to something else to which it points, so \nthat it lets something be seen as something, it thus acquires a synthesis\u00ad\nstructure, and with this it takes over the possibility oftovering up.'

This is the formal meaning of that branch \nof research which calls itself \"phenomenology\". But here we are expressing \nnothing else than the maxim formulated above : 'To the things themselves !' \nThus the term \"phenomenology\" is quite different in its meaning froni \nexpressions such as \"theology\" and the like. Those terms designate the \n1 Heidegger is here pointing out that the word il\u0114os is etymologically akin to the \nverb Uym\u2022, which has among its numerous meanings those of laying out, exhibiting, setting \nforth, recounting, telling a tau, malcing a statement. Thus il&yos as ilynv can be thought of \nas the faculty of 'reason' ('Vernunft') which makes such activities possible. But iloyos can \nalso mean -rei ileyoll-&ov (that which is laid out, exhibited, set forth, told) ; in this sense \nit is the underlying subject matter (To VtrOK\u00a3lfL&ov) to which one addresses oneself and \nwhich one discusses ('Ansprechen und Besprechen') ; as such it lies 'at the bottom' ('zurn \nGrunde') of what is exhibited or told, and is thus the 'ground' or 'reason' ('Grund') for \ntelling it. But when something is exhibited or told, it is exhibited in its relatedness ('in \nseiner Bezogenheit') ; and in this way iiOyos as il\u00a3yOj..&ov comes to stand for just such a \nrelation or relationship ('Beziehung und Verhaltnis'). The three senses here distinguished \ncorrespond to three senses of the Latin 'ratio', by which iloyos was traditionally translated , \nthough Heidegger explicitly calls attention to only one of these. Notice that 'Beziehung' \n(which we translate as 'relation') can also be used in some contexts where 'Ansprechen' \n(our 'addressing oneself') would be equally appropriate\u0118 Notice further that 'Verhaltnis' \n(our 'relationship'), which is ordinarily a synonym for 'Beziehung', can, like il&yos and \n'ratio', also refer to the special kind of relationship which one finds in a mathematical \nproportion. The etymological connection between 'Vernehmen' and 'Vernunft' should \nalso be noted. \n"

Only as \nphenomenology, is ontology possible. In the phenomenological conception of \n\"phenomenon\" what one has in mind as that which shows itself is the \nBeing of entities, its meaning, its modifications and derivatives.1 And this \nshowing-itself is not just any showing-itself, nor is it some such thing as \n36 \nappearing. Least of all can the Being of entities ever be anything such that \n'behind it' stands something else 'which does not appear'. \n'Behind' the phenomena of phenomenology there is essentially nothing \nelse; on the other hand, what is to become a phenomenon can be hidden. \nAnd just because the phenomena are proximally and for the most part \nnot given, there is need for phenomenology. Covered-up-ness is the counter\u00ad\nconcept to 'phenomenon'. \nThere are various ways in which phenomena can be covered up. In the \nfirst place, a phenomenon can be covered up in the sense that it is still \nquite undiscovered. It is neither known nor unknown. 2 \nMoreover, a \nphenomenon can be buried over [ verschiittet]. This means that it has at some \ntime been discovered but has deteriorated [ verfiel] to the point of getting \ncovered up again. This covering-up can become complete; or rather-and \nas a rule-what has been discovered earlier may still be visible, though \nonly as a semblance. Yet so much semblance, so much 'Being'. 3 This cover\u00ad\ning-up as a 'disguising' is both the most frequent and the most dangerous, \nfor here the possibilities of deceiving and misleading are especially \nstubborn. Within a 'system', perhaps, those structures of Being-and \ntheir concepts-which are still available but veiled in their indigenous \ncharacter, may claim their rights. For when they have been bound \ntogether constructively in a system, they present themselves as something \n'clear', requiring no further justification, and thus can serve as the point \nof departure for a process of deduction. \n\"' \nThe covering-up itself, whether in the se\u0223se of hiddenness, burying\u00ad\nover, or disguise, has in turn two possibilities.

And the difficulty of this \nkind of research lies in making it self-critical in a positive sense. \nThe way in which Being and its structures are encountered in the mode \nof phenomenon is one which must first of all be wrested from the objects \nof phenomenology. Thus the very point of departure [Ausgang] for our \nanalysis requires that it be secured by the proper method, just as much as \ndoes our access [..(ugang] to the phenomenon, or our passage [Durchgang] \nthrough whatever is prevalently covering it up. The idea of grasping and \n37 \nexplicating phenomena in a way which is 'original' and 'intuitive' \n[\"originaren\" und \"intuitiven\"] is directly opposed to the naivete of a \nhaphazard, 'immediate', and unreflective 'beholding'.

But to the extent that by uncovering the meaning of Being \nand the basic structures of Dasein in general we may exhibit the horizon \nfor any further ontological study of those entities which do not have the \ncharacter ofDasein, this hermeneutic also becomes a 'hermeneutic' in the \nsense of working out the conditions on which the possibility of any onto\u00ad\nlogical investigation depends.

The Being of any such entity \nis in each case mine.1 These entities, in their Being, comport themselves \ntowards their Being. As entities with such Being, they are delivered over \n42 \nto their own Being.2 Being is that which is an issue for every such entity.3 \nThis way of characterizing Dasein has a double consequence : \nI .  The 'essence' [\"Wesen\"] of this entity lies in its \"to be\" [Zu-sein] . Its \nBeing-what-it-is [Was-sein] (essentia) must, so far as we can speak of it at \nall, be conceived in terms of its Being (existentia). But here our ontological \ntask is to show that when we choose to designate the Being of this entity \nas \"existence\" [Existenz], this term does not and cannot have the onto\u00ad\nlogical signification of the traditional term \"existentia\"; ontologically, \nexistentia is tantamount to Being-present-at-hand, a kind of Being which is \nessentially inappropriate to entities of Dasein's character. To avoid \ngetting bewildered, we shall always use the Interpretative expression \n\"presence-at-hand\" for the term \"existentia\", while the term \"existence\", as \na designation of Being, will be allotted solely to Dasein. \nThe essence of Dasein lies in its existence. Accordingly those characteristics \nwhich can be exhibited in this entity are not 'properties' present-at-hand \nof some entity which 'looks' so and so and is itself present-at-hand ; \nthey are in each case possible ways for it to be, and no more than that. \nAll the Being-as-it-is [So-sein] which this entity possesses is primarily \nBeing. So when we designate this entity with the term 'Dasein', we are \nexpressing not its \"what\" (as if it were a table, house or tree) but its Being. \n2.

I \ninstance or special case of some genus of entities as things that are \npresent-at-hand.1 To entities such as these, their Being is 'a matter of \nindifference' ;2 or more precisely, they 'are' such that their Being can be \nneither a matter of indifference to them, nor the opposite. Because \nDasein has in each case mineness [Jemeinigkeit], one must always use a \npersonal pronoun when one addresses it : 'I am', 'you are'. \nFurthermore, in each case Dasein is mine to be in one way or another. \nDasein has always made some sort of decision as to the way in which it is \nin each case mine [je meines]. That entity which in its Being has this very \nBeing as an issue, comports itself towards its Being as its ownmost pos\u00ad\nsibility. In each case Dasein is its possibility, and it 'has' this possibility, \nbut not just as a property [eigenschaftlich], as something present-at-hand \nwould. And because Dasein is in each case essentially its own possibility, \nit can, in its very Being, 'choose' itself and win itself; it can also lose itself \nand never win itself; or only 'seem' to do so. But only in so far as it is \n43 \nessentially something which can be authentic-that is, something of its own3 \n-can ithavelostitselfand not yet won itself. As modesofBeing, authenticity \nand inauthenticity (these expressions have been chosen terminologically in a \nstrict sense) are both grounded in the fact that any Dasein whatsoever is \ncharacterized by mineness. 4 But the inauthenticity ofDasein does not signify \nany 'less' Being or any 'lower' degree of Being. Rather it is the case that \neven in its fullest concretion Dasein can be characterized by inauthenticity \n-when busy, when excited, when interested, when ready for enjoyment. \nThe two characteristics of Dasein which we have sketched-the \npriority of 'existentia' over essentia, and the fact that Dasein is in each case \nmine [die Jemeinigkeit]-have already indicated that in the analytic of \nthis entity we are facing a peculiar phenomenal domain. Dasein does not \nhave the kind of Being which belongs to something merely present-at\u00ad\nhand within the world, nor does it ever have it. So neither is it to be \npresented thematically as something we come across in the same way as \n1 ' .  \n. \n\u2022 als Vorhandenem'. The earlier editions have the adjective 'vorhandenem' \ninstead of the substantive. \n2 'gleichgiiltig'. This adjective must be distinguished from the German adjective \n'indifferent', though they might both ordinarily be translated by the English 'indifferent', \nwhich we shall reserve exclusively for the former. In most passages, the latter is best \ntranslated by 'undifferentiated' or 'without further differentiation' ; occasionally, how\u00ad\never, it seems preferable to tram.late it by 'Indifferent' with an initial capital. We shall \nfollow similar conventions with the nouns 'Gieichgiiltigkeit' and 'Indifferenz'. \n3 'Und weil Dasein wesenhaft je seine Moglichkeit ist, kann dieses Seiende in seinem \nSein sich selbst \"wii.hlen\", gewinnen, es kann sich verlieren, bzw. nie und our \"scheinbar\" \ngewinnen. Verloren habenkann es sich our und noch nicht sich gewonnen haben kann es \nnur, sofern es seinem \\.Yesen nach mogliches eigentliches, das heisst sich zueigen ist.' \nOlder editions have 'je wesenhaft' and 'zueigenes'. The connection between 'eigentlich' \n('authentic', 'real') and 'eigen' ('own') is lost in translation. \n4. ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n das Dasein iiberhaupt durch J emeini_g_kc;it bestimmt ist.' \n"

The right way of presenting it is \nso far from self-evident that to determine what form it shall take is itself \nan essential part of the ontological analytic of this entity. Only by pre\u00ad\nsenting this entity in the right way can we have any understanding of its \nBeing. No matter how provisional our analysis may be, it always requires \nthe assurance that we have started correctly. \nIn determining itself as an entity, Dasein always does so in the light of \na possibility which it is itself and which, in its very Being, it somehow \nunderstands. This is the formal meaning of Dasein's existential constitu\u00ad\ntion. But this tells us that if we are to Interpret this entity ontologically, the \nproblematic of its Being must be developed from the existentiality of its \nexistence. This cannot mean, however, that \"Dasein\" is to be construed \nin terms of some concrete possible idea of existence. At the outset of our \nanalysis it is particularly important that Dasein should not be Interpreted \nwith the differentiated character [Differenz] of some definite way of \nexisting, but that it should be uncovered [aufgedcckt] in the undiffer\u00ad\nentiated character which it has proximally and for the most part. This \nundifferentiated character of Dasein's everydayness is not nothing, but a \npositive phenomenal characteristic of this entity. Out of this kind of Being \n-and back into it again-is all existing, such as it is.1 We call this every\u00ad\nday undifferentiated character of Dasein \"averageness\" [ Durchschnittlichkeit] . \nAnd because this average everydayness makes up what is ontically \nproximal for this entity, it has again and again been passed over in expli\u00ad\ncating Dasein. That which is ontically closest and well known, is onto\u00ad\nlogically the farthest and not known at all ; and its ontological signification \nis constantly overlooked. When Augustine asks: \"Quid autem propinquius \nmeipso mihi?\" and must answer: \"ego certe laboro hie fl laboro in meipso : \n44 \nfactus sum mihi terra dificultatis et sudoris nimii\", 1 this applies not only to the \nontical and pre-ontological opaqueness of Dasein but even more to the \nontological task which lies ahead; for not only must this entity not be \nmissed in that kind of Being in which it is phenomenally closest, but it \nmust be made accessible by a positive characterization. \nDasein's average everydayness, however, is not to be taken as a mere \n'aspect'. Here too, and even in the mode of inauthenticity, the structure \nof existentiality lies a priori. And here too Dasein's Being is an issue for it \nin a definite way; and Dasein comports itself towards it in the mode of \naverage everydayness, even if this is only the mode of fleeing in the face \nof it and forgetfulness thereof 2 \n1 'A us dieser Seinsart hera us und in sie zuriick ist alles Existieren, wie est ist.' \n2 'Auch in ihr geht es dem Dasein in bestimmter Weise urn sein Sein, zu dem es sich \nim Modus der durchschnittlichen Alltaglichkeit verhalt und sei es auch nur im Modus \nder Flucht davor und des Vergessens seiner.'

More literally : 'the entity that \nencounters within the world.' While Heidegger normally uses the verb 'begegnen' in this \nactive intransitive sense, a similar construction with the English 'encounter' is unidio\u00ad\nmatic and harsh. We shall as a rule use either a passive construction (as in 'entities en\u00ad\ncountered') or an active transitive construction (as in 'entities we encounter'). \n3 'Als Zugangsart zu ihm gilt das vo\u00a3iv bzw. der .\\oyos.' Here we follow the reading \nof the earlier editions. In the later editions, 'Zugangsart', which is used rather often, is \nhere replaced by 'Zugangsort', which occurs very seldom and is perhaps a misprint.

The connection between these two modes of the characters of \nBeing cannot be handled until the horizon for the question of Being has \nbeen clarified. \nIn our introduction we have already intimated that in the existential \nanalytic of Dasein we also make headway with a task which is hardly \nless pressing than that of the question of Being itself-the task of laying \nbare that a priori basis which must be visible before the question of 'what \nman is' can be discussed philosophically. The existential analytic ofDasein \ncomes bifore any psychology or anthropology, and certainly before any \nbiology. While these too are ways in which Dasein can be investigated, we \ncan define the theme of our analytic with greater precision if we dis\u00ad\ntinguish it from these.

We must \nshow that those investigations and formulations of the question which have \nbeen aimed at Dasein heretofore, have missed the real philosophical pro\u00ad\nblem (notwithstanding their objective fertility), and that as long as they \npersist in missing it, they have no right to claim that they can accomplish \nthat for which they are basically striving. In distinguishing the existential \nanalytic from anthropology, psychology, and biology, we shall confine \nourselves to what is in principle the ontological question. Our distinctions \nwill necessarily be inadequate from the standpoint of 'scientific theory' \nsimply because the scientific structure of the above-mentioned disciplines \n(not, indeed, the 'scientific attitude' of those who work to advance them) \nis today thoroughly questionable and needs to be attacked in new ways \nwhich must have their source in ontological problematics. \nHistoriologically, the aim of the existential analytic can be made \nplainer by considering Descartes, who is credited with providing the point \n46 \nof departure for modern philosophical inquiry by his discovery of the \n\"cogito sum\". He investigates the \"cogitare\" of the \"ego\", at least within \ncertain limits.

In modern times the Christian definition has \nbeen deprived of its theological character.

Moreover, \neven primitive Dasein has possibilities of a Being which is not of the \neveryday kind, and it has a specific everydayness of its own. To orient the \nanalysis of Dasein towards the 'life of primitive peoples' can have positive \nsignificance [Bedeutung] as a method because 'primitive phenomena' \nare often less concealed and less complicated by extensive self-interpreta\u00ad\ntion on the part of the Dasein in question. Primitive Dasein often speaks \nto us more directly in terms of a primordial absorption in 'phenomena' \n(taken in a pre-phenomenological sense). A way of conceiving things \nwhich seems, perhaps, rather clumsy and crude from our standpoint, can \nbe positively helpful in bringing out the ontological structures of phe\u00ad\nnomena in a genuine way. \nBut heretofore our information about primitives has been provided by \nethnology.

And if the 'world' itself is \nsomething constitutive for Dasein, one must have an insight into Dasein's \nbasic structures in order to treat the world-phenomenon conceptually. \nIn this chapter we have characterized some things positively and taken \na negative stand with regard to others ; in both cases our goal has been to \npromote a correct understanding of the tendency which underlies the \nfollowing Interpretation and the kind of questions which it poses. \nOntology can contribute only indirectly towards advancing the positive \ndisciplines as we find them today. It has a goal of its own, even if, beyond \nthe acquiring of information about entities, the question of Being is the \nspur for all scientific seeking. \n"

A Preliminary Sketch of Being-in-the-World, in terms of an Orientation \ntowards Being-in as such \nIN our preparatory discussions (Section g) we have brought out some \ncharacteristics of Being which will provide us with a steady light for our \nfurther investigation, but which will at the same time become structurally \n53 \nconcrete as that investigation continues. Dasein is an entity which, in its \nvery Being, comports itself understandingly towards that Being. In saying \nthis, we are calling attention to the formal concept of existence. Dasein exists. \nFurthermore, Dasein is an entity which in each case I myself am. Mineness \nbelongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which \nmakes authenticity and inauthenticitypossible. In each case Dasein exists in \none or the other of these two modes, or else it is modally undifferentiated.1 \nBut these are both ways in which Dasein's Being takes on a definite \ncharacter, and they must be seen and understood a priori as grounded \nupon that state of Being which we have called \"Being-in-the-world'. An \ninterpretation of this constitutive state is needed if we are to set up our \nanalytic of Dasein correctly. \nThe compound expression 'Being-in-the-world' indicates in the very way \nwe have coined it, that it stands for a unitary phenomenon. This primary \ndatum must be seen as a whole. But while Being-in-the-world cannot be \nbroken up into contentswhichmaybe pieced together, this doesnotprevent \nit from having several constitutive items in its structure. Indeed the pheno\u00ad\nmenal datum which our expression indicates is one which may, in fuct, be \nlooked at in three ways. If we study it, keepingthewholephenomenon firmly \nin mind beforehand, the following items may be brought out for emphasis: \nFirst, the 'in-the-world'. With regard to this there arises the task of \ninquiring into the ontological structure of the 'world' and defining the \nidea of worldhood as such. (See the third chapter of this Division.) \n1 'Zum existierenden Dasein gehiirt die Jemeinigkeit als Bedingung der Miiglichkeit \nvon Eigentlichkeit und Uneigentlichkeit.

'An' signifies \"I am accustomed\", \"I am familiar with\", \"I look \nafter something\". 2 It has the signification of\"colo\" in the senses of \"habito\" \nand \"diligo\". The entity to which Being-in in this signification belongs is \none which we have characterized as that entity which in each case I \nmyself am (bin]. The expression 'bin' is connected with 'bei', and so 'ich \nbin' ['I am'] means in its turn \"I reside\" or \"dwell alongside\" the \nworld, as that which is familiar to me in such and such a way. 3 \n\"Being\" [Sein], as the infinitive of 'ich bin' (that is to say, when it is \nunderstood as an existentiale), signifies \"to reside alongside . . .  \", \"to be \nfamiliar with . .\n. \". \"Being-in\" is thus the formal existential expressionfor the \nBeing of Dasein, which has Being-in-the-world as its essential state. \n'Being alongside' the world in the sense of being absorbed in the world' \n1 Reading 'innan-wohnen'. As Heidegger points out in his footnote, this puzzling \npassage has its source in Grimm's Kleinere Schrijten, Vol. VII, pp. 247 ff., where we find \ntwo short articles, the first entitled 'IN' and the second 'IN UND BEl'. The first \narticle begins by comparing a number of archaic German words meaning 'domus', all \nhaving a form similar to our English 'inn', which Grimm mentions. He goes on \u00b7to \npostulate 'a strong verb \"innan\", which must have meant either \"habitare\", \"domi esse\", \nor \"recipere in domum\" 1 {though only a weak derivative form 'innian' is actually found), \nwith a surviving strong preterite written either as 'an' or as 'ann'. Grimm goes on \nto argue that the preposition 'in' is derived from the verb, rather than the verb from the \npreposition. \n2 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  \"an\" bedeutet: ich bin gewohnt, vertraut mit, ich pflege etwas \u2022 .  .' \nIn Grimm's second article he adds: 'there was also an anomalous \"ann\" with the plural \n\"unum\", which expressed \"amo\", \"diligo\", ''faveo\", and to which our \"gonnen\" and \n\"Gunst\" are immediately related, as has long been recognized. \"Ann\" really means \"ich \nbin eingewohnt\", \"pflege zu bauen\"; this conceptual transition may be shown with \nminimal complication in the Latin \"colo\", which stands for \"habito\" as well as \"diligo\".' \nIt is not entirely clear whether Heidegger's discussion of 'an' is aimed to elucidate the \npreposition 'an' ( which corresponds in some of its usages to the English 'at', and which he \nhas just used in remarking that the water and the glass are both at a location), or rather \nto explain the preterite 'an' of 'innan'. \nThe reader should note that while the verb 'wohnen' normally means 'to reside' or 'to \ndwell', the expression 'ich bin gewohnt' means 'I am accustomed to', and 'ich bin einge\u00ad\nwohnt' means 'I have become accustomed to the place where I reside--to my surround\u00ad\nings'. Similarly 'ich pf!ege etwas' may mean either 'I am accustomed to do something' \nor 'I take care of something' or 'I devote myself to it'. ( Grimm's 'pf!ege zu bauen' pre\u00ad\nsumably means 'I am accustomed to putting my trust in something', 'I can build on it'.) \nThe Latin, 'colo' has the parallel meanings of 'I take care of something' or 'cherish' it \n('diligo') and 'I dwell' or 'I inhabit' ('habito'). \na '  \n\u2022\n.\n\u2022\n ich wohne, halte mich auf bei . . .  der Welt, als dem so und so Vertrauten.' The \npreposition 'bei', like 'an', does not have quite the semantical range of any English pre\u00ad\nposition. Our 'alongside', with which we shall translate it when other devices seem less \nsatisfactory, especially in the phrase 'Being alongside' ('Sein bei'), is often quite mis\u00ad\nleading; the sense here is closer to that of 'at' in such expressions as 'at home' or 'at my \nfather's', or that of the French 'che;r.'. Here again Heidegger seems to be relying upon \nGrimm, who proceeds (loc. cit.) to connect 'bei' with 'bauen' ('build') and 'bin'. \n\u009b '  \n.\n.\n\u2022\n in dem .\n. \u2022 Sinne des Aufgehens in der Welt . .  .' 'Aufgehen' means literally 'to go \nup', or 'to rise' in the sense that the sun 'rises' or the dough 'rises'. But when followed by \nthe preposition 'in', it takes on other meanings.

In these analyses the issue is one of seeing a primordial \nstructure of Dasein's Being-a structure in accordance with whose phe\u00ad\nnomenal content the concepts of Being must be Articulated ; because of \nthis, and because this structure is in principle one which cannot be \ngrasped by the traditional ontological categories, this 'being-alongside' \n55 \nmust be examined still more closely. We shall again choose the method of \ncontrasting it with a relationship of Being which is essentially different \nontologically-viz. categorial-but which we express by the same linguis-\ntic means. Fundamental ontological distinctions are easily obliterated; \nand if they are to be envisaged phenomenally in this way, this must be \ndone explicitly, even at the risk of discussing the 'obvious'. The status of \nthe ontological analytic shows, however, that we have been far from \ninterpreting these obvious matters with an adequate 'grasp', still less with \nregard for the meaning of their Being; and we are even farther from \npossessing a stable coinage for the appropriate structural concepts. \nAs an existentiale, 'Being alongside' the world never means anything \nlike the Being-present-at-hand-together of Things that occur. There is no \nsuch thing as the 'side-by-side-ness' of an entity called 'Dasein' with \nanother entity called 'world'. Of course when two things are present-at\u00ad\nhand together alongside one another, 1 we are accustomed to express this \noccasionally by something like 'The table stands \"by\" ['bei'] the door' \nor 'The chair \"touches\" ['beriihrt'] the wall'. Taken strictly, 'touching' is \nnever what we are talking about in such cases, not because accurate re\u00ad\nexamination will always eventually establish that there is a space between \nthe chair and the wall, but because in principle the chair can never touch \nthe wall, even if the space between them should be equal to zero. If the \nchair could touch the wall, this would presuppose that the wall is the sort \nof thing 'for' which a chair would be encounter able. 2 An entity present-at\u00ad\nhand within the world can be touched by another entity only if by its \nvery nature the latter entity has Being-in as its own kind of Being--only if, \nwith its Being-there [Da-sein], something like the world is already re-, \nvealed to it, so that from out of that world another entity can manifest \nitself in touching, and thus become accessible in its Being-present-at\u00ad\nhand. When two entities are present-at-hand within the world, and fur\u00ad\nthermore are worldless in themselves, they can never 'touch' each other, \nit 'goes into' 30 without remainder; a country 'geht auf' into another country into which \nit is taken over or absorbed; a person 'geht auf' in anything to which he devotes \nhimself fully, whether an activity or another person. We shall usually translate 'aufgehen' \nby some form of 'absorb'. \n1 'Das Beisammen zweier Vorhandener . .  .' \na 'Voraussetzung dafiir ware, dass die Wand \"fur\" den Stuhl begegnen konnte.'

The clause 'furthermore \nare worldless' must not be left out; for even entities which are not world\u00ad\nless-Dasein itself, for example-are present-at-hand 'in' the world, or, \nmore exactly, can with some right and within certain limits be taken as \nmerely present-at-hand. To do this, one must completely disregard or just \nnot see the existential state of Being-in. But the fact that 'Dasein' can be \ntaken as something which is present-at-hand and just present-at-hand, is \nnot to be confused with acertainwayof'presence-at-hand' which is Dasein's \nown. This latter kind of presence-at-hand becomes accessible not by dis\u00ad\nregarding Dasein's specific structures but only by understanding them in \nc.dvance. Dasein understands its ownmost Being in the sense of a certain \n56 \n'factual Being-present-at-hand'.ii And yet the 'factuality' of the fact \n[Tatsache] of one's own Dasein is at bottom quite different ontologically \nfrom the factual occurrence of some kind of mineral, for example. When\u00ad\never Dasein is, it is as a Fact; and the factuality of such a Fact is what we \n\u0262hall call Dasein's ''facticity\" .1 This is a definite way of Being [Seinsbe\u00ad\nstimmtheit], and it has a complicated structure which cannot even be \ngrasped as a problem until Dasein's basic existential states have been \nworked out. The concept of \"facticity\" implies that an entity 'within-the\u00ad\nworld' has Being-in-the-world in such a way that it can understand itself \nas bound up in its 'destiny' with the Being of those entities which it \nencounters within its own world. \nIn the first instance it is enough to see the ontological difference \nbetween Being-in as an existentiale and the category of the 'insideness' \nwhich things present-at-hand can have with regard to one another. By \nthus delimiting Being-in, we are not denying every kind of 'spatiality' \nto Dasein. On the contrary, Dasein itself has a 'Being-in-space' of its \nO\\\\ n; but this in turn is possible only on the basis of Being-in-the-world in \ngeneral. Hence Being-in is not to be explained ontologically by some \non tical characterization, as if one were to say, for instance, that Being-in \nin a world is a spiritual property, and that man's 'spatiality' is a result of \nhis bodily nature (which, at the same time, always gets 'founded' upon \ncorporeality) . Here again we are faced with the Being-present-at-hand\u00ad\ntogether of some such spiritual Thing along with a corporeal Thing, \nwhile the Being of the entity thus compounded remains more obscure \n1 'Die Tatsachlichkeit des Faktums Dasein, als welches jeweilig jedes Dasein ist, \nnennen wir seine Fakti::itiit.' We shall as a rule translate 'Tatsachlichkeit' as 'factuality', \nand 'Faktizitat' as 'facticity', following our conventions for 'tatsachlich' and 'faktisch'. \n(See note 2, p. 27, H. 7 above.) The present passage suggests a comparable distinction \nbetween the nouns 'Tatsache' and 'Faktum' ;  so while we find many passages where these \nseem to be used in terchangeably, we translate 'Faktum' as 'Fact' with an initial capital, \nusing 'fact' for 'Tatsache' and various other expressions.

Such an insight will keep us from failing to see this structure or \nfrom previously cancelling it out-a procedure motivated not ontologi\u00ad\ncally but rather 'metaphysically' by the naive supposition that man is, \nin the first instance, a spiritual Thing which subsequently gets misplaced \n'into' a space. \nDasein's facticity is such that its Being-in-the-world has always dis\u00ad\npersed [ zerstreutJ itself or even split itself up into definite ways of Being-\nin. The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples : having \nto do with something, producing something, attending to something and \nlooking after it, making use of something, giving something up and letting \nit go, undertaking, accomplishing, evincing, interrogating, considering, \ndiscussing, determining . . . .  All these ways of Being-in have concern1 as \n57 \ntheir kind of Being-a kind of Being which we have yet to characterize in \ndetail. Leaving undone, neglecting, renouncing, taking a rest-these too \nare ways of concern; but these are all deficient modes, in which the pos\u00ad\nsibilities of concern are kept to a 'bare minimum'. 2 The term 'concern' \nhas, in the first instance, its colloquial [ vorwissenschaftliche] signification, \nand can mean to carry out something, to get it done [erledigen], to \n'straighten it out'. It can also mean to 'provide oneself with something'. 3 \nWe use the expression with still another characteristic tum of phrase \nwhen we say \"I am concerned for the success of the undertaking.\"' Here \n'concern' means something like apprehensiveness. In contrast to these \ncolloquial ontical significations, the expression 'concern' will be used in \nthis investigation as an ontological term for an existentiale, and will desig-\nnate the Being of a possible way of Being-in-the-world. This term has \nbeen chosen not because Dasein happens to be proximally and to a large \nextent 'practical' and economic, but because the Being of Dasein itself \n1 'Besorgen'. AJ Heideger points out, he will use this term in a special sense which is to \nbe distinguished from many of its customary usages. We shall, as a rule, translate it by \n'concern' though this is by no means an exact equivalent. The English word 'concern' is \nused in \u0331any expresions where 'Besorgen' would be inappropriate in German, such as \n'This concerns you' 'That is my concern', 'He has an interest in several banking con\u00ad\ncerns'. 'Besorgen' s\u0330ds rather for the kind of 'concern' in which we 'concern ourselves' \nwith activities which we perform or things which we procure. \nz \u2022 . . . a:Je Modi des \"Nur noch\" in bezug auf Moglichkeiten des Besorgens.' The point \nis that in these cases concern is just barely ('nur noch') involved. \n3 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n sich etwas besorgen im Sinne von \"sich etwas verschaffen\".' \n4 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n ich besorge, dass das Unternehmen !llisslingt.' Here it is not diffic\u0104l\u0105 to find a \ncorresponding usage of 'concern', as our versiOn suggests. But the ana\u032fo!p' IS \n,\nImperfect. \nWhile we can say that we are 'concerned for the success of the enterpriSe or concerned \nlest the enterprise should fail,' we w\u0106uld hardly f?llow the German to the extent of \nexpresing 'concern that' the enterpriSe should fat!; nor would the German express \n'Beaorgen' at discovering that the enterprise has failed already. \n"

These-like their \nopposites, 'gaiety' and 'freedom from care'-are ontically possible only \nbecause Dasein, when understood ontologically, is care. Because Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world belongs essentially to Dasein, its Being towards the world [Sein \nzur Welt] is essentially concern. \nFrom what we have been saying, it follows that Being-in is not a 'pro\u00ad\nperty' which Dasein sometimes has and sometimes does not have, and \nwithout which it could be just as well as it could with it. It is not the case \nthat man 'is' and then has, by way of an extra, a relationship-of-Being \ntowards the 'world'-a world with which he provides himself occasionally. 2 \nDasein is never 'proximally' an entity which is, so to speak, free from \nBeing-in, but which sometimes has the inclination to take up a 'relation\u00ad\nship' towards the world. Taking up relationships towards the world is \npossible only because Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, is as it is. This state of \nBeing does not arise just because some other entity is present-at-hand \noutside ofDasein and meets up with it. Such an entity can 'meet up with' \nDasein only in so far as it can, of its own accord, show itself within a world. \nNowadays there is much talk about 'man's having an environment \n[Umwelt] '; but this says nothing ontologically as long as this 'having' is \nleft indefinite. In its very possibility this 'having' is founded upon the \n58 \nexistential state of Being-in. Because Dasein is essentially an entity with \nBeing-in, it can explicitly discover those entities which it encounters \nenvironmentally, it can know them, it can avail itself of them, it can have \nthe 'world'. To talk about 'having an environment' is ontically trivial, \nbut ontologically it presents a problem. To solve it requires nothing else \nthan defining the Being of Dasein, and doing so in a way which is onto\u00ad\nlogically adequate. Although this state of Being is one of which use has \nmade in biology, especially since K. von Baer, one must not conclude \nthat its philosophical use implies 'biologism'. For the environment is a \nstructure which even biology as a positive science can never find and can \nnever define, but must presuppose and constantly \n.\nemploy. Yet, even as an \na priori condition for the objects which biology takes for its theme, this \nstructure itself can be explained philosophically only if it has been con\u00ad\nceived beforehand as a structure ofDasein.

This state of Dasein's Being is now \none with which one is just barely acquainted (and indeed as something \nobvious), with the stamp of an inappropriate interpretation. So in this \nway it becomes the 'evident' point of departure for problems of epistemo\u00ad\nlogy or the 'metaphysics of knowledge'. For what is more obvious than \nthat a 'subject' is related to an 'Object' and vice versa ? This 'subject\u00ad\nObject-relationship' must be presupposed. But while this presupposition \nis unimpeachable in its facticity, this makes it indeed a baleful one, if its \nontological necessity and especially its ontological meaning are to be left \nin the dark. \nThus the phenomenon of Being-in has for the most part been repre\u00ad\nsented exclusively by a single exemplar-knowing the world.

But no sooner was the 'phenomenon of \nknowing the world' grasped than it got interpreted in a 'superficial', \n1 'Die Exemplijizierung des ln-Seins an einemfundierten Modus.' The conception of 'founded' \nmodes is taken from Husser!, who introduces the concept of 'founding' in his Logische \nUntersuchungen, vol. II, Part I, chapter 2 (second edition, Halle, 19 13, p. 261). This \npasage has been closely paraphrased as follows by Marvin Farber in his The Fourukztion \nof Phenomenology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1943, p. 297 ; 'If in accordance with esential \nlaw an a can only exist in a comprehensive unity which connects it with a ,., then we \nsay, an a as such needs foundation through a ,., or also, an a as such is in need of com\u00ad\npletion by means of a f'\u00b7 If accordingly ao , f'O are definite particular cases of the pure \ngenera a, or ,., which stand in the cited relationship, and if they are members of one \nwhole, then we say that ao is founded by f'O; and it is exclusively founded by f'O if the need \nof the completion of ao is alone satisfied by f'O\u2022 This terminology can be applied to the \nspecies themselves ; the equivocation is harmles.' Thus a founded mode of Being-in is \nsimply a mode which can subsist only when connected with something else. \n"

The evidence for this is the procedure (still customary \ntoday) of setting up knowing as a 'relation between subject and Object' \n-a procedure in which there lurks as much 'truth' as vacuity. But subject \nand Object do not coincide with Dasein and the world. \nEven if it were feasible to give an ontological definition of \"Being-in\" \nprimarily in terms of a Being-in-the-world which knows, it would still be our \nfirst task to show that knowing has the phenomenal character of a Being \nwhich is in and towards the world. If one reflects upon this relationship of \nBeing, an entity called \"Nature\" is given proximally as that which becomes \nknown. Knowing, as such, is not to be met in this entity. If knowing 'is' at \nall, it belongs solely to those entities which know. But even in those entities, \nhuman-Things, knowing is not present-at-hand. In any case, it is not \nexternally ascertainable as, let us say, bodily properties are.1 Now, inas\u00ad\nmuch as knowing belongs to these entities and is not some external \ncharacteristic, it must be 'inside'. Now the more unequivocally one main\u00ad\ntains that knowing is proximally and really 'inside' and indeed has by no \nmeans the same kind of Being as entities which are both physical and \npsychical, the less one presupposes when one believes that one is making \nheadway in the question of the essence of knowledge and in the clarifica\u00ad\ntion of the relationship between subject and Object. For only then can \nthe problem arise of how this knowing subject comes out of its inner \n'sphere' into one which is 'other and external', of how knowing can have \nany object at all, and of how one must think of the object itself so that \neventually the subject knows it without needing to venture a leap into \nanother sphere. But in any of the numerous varieties which this approach \nmay take, the question of the kind of Being which belongs to this knowing \nsubject is left entirely unasked, though whenever its knowing gets handled, \nits way of Being is already included tacitly in one's theme. Of course we \nare sometimes assured that we are certainly not to think of the subject's \n\"inside\" [Innen] and its 'inner sphere' as a sort of 'box' Gr 'cabinet'. But \nwhen one asks for the positive signification of this 'inside' of immanence \nin which knowing is proximally enclosed, or when one inquires how this \n'Being inside' [\"Innenseins\"] which knowing possesses has its own char\u00ad\nacter of Being grounded in the kind of Being which belongs to the subject, \nthen silence reigns. And no matter how this inner sphere may get inter\u00ad\npreted, if one does no more than ask how knowing makes its way 'out of' \nit and achieves 'transcendence', it becomes evident that the knowing \n6r \nwhich presents such enigmas will remain problematical unless one has \npreviously clarified how it is and what it is. \n1 'In jedem Faile ist est nicht so ausserlich feststellbar wie etwa leibliche Eigenschaften. \nThe older editions have ' . \u2022 .  nicht ist es . .  .' and place a comma after 'feststellbar'. \n"

But if, as we suggest, we thus find phenomenally that \nknowing is a kind of Being which belongs to Being-in-the-world, one might object \nthat with such an Interpretation of knowing, the problem of knowledge \nis nullified; for what is left to be asked if one presupposes that knowing is \nalready 'alongside' its world, when it is not supposed to reach that world \nexcept in the transcending of the subject? In this question the construc\u00ad\ntivist 'standpoint', which has not been phenomenally demonstrated, again \ncomes to the fore; but quite apart from this, what higher court is to decide \nwhether and in what sense there is to be any problem of knowledge other \nthan that of the phenomenon of knowing as such and the kind of Being \nwhich belongs to the knower? \nIf we now ask what shows itself in the phenomenal findings about \nknowing, we must keep in mind that knowing is grounded beforehand \nin a Being-already-alongside-the-world, which is essentially constitutive \nfor Dasein's Being.1 Proximally, this Being-already-alongside is not just \na fixed staring at something that is purely present-at-hand. Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, as concern, is fascinated by the world with which it is concerned. 2 \nIf knowing is to be possible as a way of determining the nature of the \npresent-at-hand by observing it, 3 then there must first be a deficiency in our \nhaving-to-do with the world concernfully. When concern holds back \n[Sichenthalten] from any kind of producing, manipulating, and the like, \nit puts itself into what is now the sole remaining mode of Being-in, the \nmode of just tarrying alongside . . . .

It takes over a 'view-point' in \nadvance from the entity which it encounters.

This perceptive retention of an assertion6 about \nsomething is itself a way of Being-in-the-world; it is not to be Interpreted \nas a 'procedure' by which a subject provides itself with representations \n[V orstellungen] of something which remain stored up 'inside' as having \nbeen thus appropriated, and with regard to which the question of how \nthey 'agree' with actuality can occasionally arise. \nWhen Dasein directs itself towards something and grasps it, it does not \nsomehow first get out of an inner sphere in which it has been proximally \nencapsulated, but its primary kind of Being is such that it is always \n'outside' alongside entities which it encounters and which belong to a \nworld already discovered. Nor is any inner sphere abandoned when \nDasein dwells alongside the entity to be known, and determines its char\u00ad\nacter ; but even in this 'Being-outside' alongside the object, Dasein is still \n'inside', if we understand this in the correct sense; that is to say, it is itself \n'inside' as a Being-in-the-world which knows. And furthermore, the \nperceiving of what is known is not a process of returning with one's booty \nto the 'cabinet' of consciousness after one has gone out and grasped it; \neven in perceiving, retaining, and preserving, the Dasein which knows \nremains outside, and it does so as Dasein.

The word 'Aufenthalt' norm\u00ad\nally means a stopping-off at some place, a sojourn, an abiding, or even an abode or dwel\u00ad\nling. Here the author is exploiting the fact that it includes both the prefixes 'auf-' and \n'ent-', which we find in the verbs 'aufhalten' and 'enthalten'. 'Aufhalten' means to hold \nsomething at a stage which it has reached, to arrest it, to stop it; when used reflexively it \ncan mean to stay at a place, to dwell there. While 'enthalten' usually means to contain, \nit preserves its more literal meaning of holding back or refraining, when it is used re\u00ad\nflexively. All these meanings are presumably packed into the word 'Aufenthalt' as used \nhere, and are hardly suggested by our 'd\u00fdelling'. \n3 'Das Vernehmen hat die Vollzugsart des Ansprechens und Besprechens von etwas als \netwas.'

By unravelling these we can get \nan indication of the different kinds of phenomena that are signified, and \nof the way in which they are interconnected. \n1 .  \"World\" is used as an ontical concept, and signifies the totality of \nthose entities which can be present-at-hand within the world. \n2. \"World\" functions as an ontological term, and signifies the Being \nof those entities which we have just mentioned. And indeed 'world' can \nbecome a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities : \nfor instance, when one talks of the 'world' of a mathematician, 'world' \n65 \nsignifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics. \n3\u00b7 \"World\" can be understood in another ontical sense-not, however, \nas those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be en\u00ad\ncountered within-the-world, but rather as that 'wherein' a factical Dasein \nas such can be said to 'live' . \"World\" has here a pre-ontological existentiell \nsignification. Here again there are different possibilities : ''world\" rna y stand \nfor the 'public' we-world, or one's 'own' closest (domestic) environment.1 \n4\u00b7 Finally, \"world\" designates the ontologico-existential concept of \nworldhood. Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural \nwholes any special 'worlds' may have at the time ; but it embraces in itself \nthe a priori character of worldhood in general. We shall reserve the \nexpression \"world\" as a term for our third signification.

We shall designate these latter \nentities as \"belonging to the world\" or \"within-the-world\" [weltzuge\u00ad\nhorig oder innerweltlich] . \nA glance at previous ontology shows that if one fails to see Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world as a state of Dasein, the phenomenon of worldhood likewise \ngets passed over. One tries instead to Interpret the world in terms of the \nBeing of those entities which are present-at-hand within-the-world but \nwhich are by no means proximally discovered-namely, in terms of \nNature.

The word 'Umwelt', which is \ncustomarily translated as 'environment', means literally the 'world around' or the 'world \nabout'. The prefix 'urn-', however, not only may mean 'around' or 'about', but, as we \nshall see, can also be used in an expression such as 'urn zu . .  .', which is most easily \ntranslated as 'in order to'. Section 15 will be largely devoted to a study of several words in \nwhich this same prefix occurs, though this is by no means apparent in the words we have \nchosen to represent them: 'Umgang' ('dealings') ; 'das Um-zu' {'the \"in-order-to\" ') ; \n'Umsicht' ('circumspection'). \n"

These entang\u00ad\nling errors become plain if in the course of our investigation we now ask \nwhich entities shall be taken as our preliminary theme and established as \nthe pre-phenomenal basis for our study. \nOne may answer: \"Things.\" But with this obvious answer we have \nperhaps already missed the pre-phenomenal basis we are seeking. For in \n68 \naddressing these entities as 'Things' (res), we have tacitly anticipated \ntheir ontological character. When analysis starts with such entities and \ngoes on to inquire about Being, what it meets is Thinghood and Reality. \nOntological explication discovers, <l;S it proceeds, such characteristics of \nBeing as substantiality, materiality, extendedness, side-by-side-ness, and \nso forth. But even pre-ontologically, in such Being as this, the entities \nwhich we encounter in concern are proximally hidden. When one desig\u00ad\nnates Things as the entities that are 'proximally given', one goes onto\u00ad\nlogically astray, even though ontically one has something else in mind. \nWhat one really has in mind remains undetermined. But suppose one \ncharacterizes these 'Things' as Things 'invested with value' ? What does \n\"value\" mean onto logically ? How are we to categorize this 'investing' \nand Being-invested ? Disregarding the obscurity of this structure of \ninvestiture with value, have we thus met that phenomenal characteristic \nof Being which belongs to what we encounter in our concernful dealings ? \nThe Greeks had an appropriate term for 'Things' : 1rpayp.a-ra-that is \nto say, that which one has to do with in one's concernful dealings \n"

But ontologically, the specifically 'pragmatic' character of \nthe 1rpayJLa-ra is just what the Greeks left in obscurity; they thought of \nthese 'proximally' as 'mere Things'. We shall call those entities which we \nencounter in concern \"equipment\".1 In our dealings we come across \nequipment for writing, sewing, working, transportation, measurement. \nThe kind of Being which equipment possesses must be exhibited. The \nclue for doing this lies in our first defining what makes an item of equip\u00ad\nment-namely, its equipmentality. \nTaken strictly, there 'is' no such thing as an equipment. To the Being \nof any equipment there always belongs a totality of equipment, in which \nit can be this equipment that it is. Equipment is essentially 'something \nin-order-to \u2022\n.\n.\n \n' [\"etwas um-zu . . .  \"]. A  totality of equipment is constituted \nby various ways of the 'in-order-to', such as serviceability, conduciveness, \nusability, manipulability. \nIn the 'in-order-to' as a structure there lies an assignment or refereru;e of \nsomething to something. 2 Only in the analyses which are to follow can \nthe phenomenon which this term 'assignment' indicates be made visible \nin its ontological genesis. Provisionally, it is enough to take a look \nphenomenally at a manifold of such assignments. Equipment-in accord\u00ad\nance with its equipmentality-always is in terms of [aus] its belonging to \nother equipment : ink-stand, pen, ink, paper, blotting pad, table, lamp, \nfurniture, windows, doors, room. These 'Things' never show themselves \n1 'das <;eug'. The word 'Zeug' has no precise English equivalent. While it may mean any \nimplement, instrument, or tool, Heidegger uses it for the most part as a collective noun \nwhich is analogous to our relatively specific 'gear' (as in 'gear for fishing') or the more \nelaborate 'paraphernalia', or the still more general 'equipment', which we shall employ \nthroughout this translation. In this collective sense 'Zeug' can sometimes be used in a way \nwhich is comparable to the use of 'stuff' in such sentences as 'there is plenty of stuff lying \naround'. (See H. 74.) In general, however, this pejorative connotation is lacking. For the \nmost part Heidegger uses the term as a collective noun, so that he can say that there is no \nsuch thing as 'an equipment' ; but he still uses it occasionally with an indefinite article to \nrefer to some specific tool or instrument-some item or bit of equipment. \n2 'In der Struktur \"Um-zu\" liegt eine Verweisung von etwas auf etwas.' There is no close \nEnglish equivalent for the word 'Verweisung', which occurs many times in this chapter. \nThe basic metaphor seems to be that of turning something away towards something else, \nor pointing it away, as when one 'refers' or 'commits' or 'relegates' or 'asigns' something \nto something else, whether one 'refers' a symbol to what it symbolizes, 'refers' a beggar \nto a welfare agency, 'commits' a person for trial, 'relegates' or 'banishes' him to Siberia, \nor even 'assigns' equipment to a purpose for which it is to be used. 'Verweisung' thus does \nsome of the work of 'reference', 'commitment', 'assignment', 'relegation', 'banishment'; \nbut it does not do all the work of any of these expressions. For a businessman to 'refer' to \na letter, for a symbol to 'refer' to what it symbolizes, for a man to 'commit larceny or \nmurder' or merely to 'commit himself' to certain partisan views, for a teacher to give a \npupil a long 'assignment', or even for a journalist to receive an 'assignment' to the Vatican, \nwe would have to find some other verb than 'verweisen'. We shall, however, use the \nverbs 'assign' and 'refer' and their derivatives as perhaps the least misleading substitutes, \nemploying whichever seems the more appropriate in the context, and occasionally using \na hendiadys as in the present passage. See Section 1 7  for further discussion. (When other \nwords such as 'anweisen' or 'zuweisen' are translated as 'assign', we shall usually subjoin \nthe German in brackets.) \n"

Before it does \nso, a totality of equipment has already been discovered. \nEquipment can genuinely show itself only in dealings cut to its own \nmeasure (hamering with a hammer, for example) ; but in such dealings \nan entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing, \nnor is the equipment-structure known as such even in the using.

In ordinary German \nusage, 'Umsicht' seems to have much the same connotation as our 'circumspection'-a \nkind of awarenes in which one looks around before one decides just what one ought to \ndo next.

Theoretical behaviour is just looking, without circumspection. But \nthe fact that this looking is non-circumspective does not mean that it \nfollows no rules : it constructs a canon for itself in the form of method. \nThe ready-to-hand is not grasped theoretically at all, nor is it itself \nthe sort of thing that circumspection takes proximally as a circumspective \ntheme. The peculiarity of what is proximally ready-to-hand is that, in \nits readiness-to-hand, it must, as it were, withdraw [zuriickzuziehen] in \norder to be ready-to-hand quite authentically. That with which our every-\nday dealings proximally dwell is not the tools themselves [die Werkzeuge \nselbst]. On the contrary, that with which we concern ourselves primarily \nis the work-that which is to be produced at the time; and this is accord\u00ad\ningly ready-to-hand too. The work bears with it that referential totality \n70 \nwithin which the equipment is encountered. 2 \nThe work to be produced, as the \"towards-which\" of such things as the \nhammer, the plane, and the needle, likewise has the kind of Being that \nbelongs to equipment. The shoe which is to be produced is for wearing \n(footgear) [Schuhzeug] ; the clock is manufactured for telling the time. \nThe work which we chiefly encounter in our concernful dealings-the \nwork that is to be found when one is \"at work\" on something [ das in \nArbeit befindliche]-has a usability which belongs to it essentially; in \nthis usability it lets us encounter already the \"towards-which\" for which \nit is usable. A work that someone has ordered [das bestellte Werk] i s  only \nby reason of its use and the assignment-context of entities which is dis\u00ad\ncovered in using it. \nBut the work to be produced is not merely usable for something.

In \nthis chapter the word 'Werk' ('work') usually refers to the product achieved by working \nrather than to the process of working as such. We shall as a rule translate 'Verweisungs\u00ad\nganzheit' as 'referential totality', though sometimes the clumsier 'totality of assignments' \nmay convey the idea more effectively.

If, in our everyday concern with the 'environment', it is to be possible \nfor equipment ready-to-hand to be encountered in its 'Being-in-itself' \n[in seinem \"An-sich-sein\"], then \u00df those assignments and referential \ntotalities in which our circumspection 'is absorbed' cannot become a \ntheme for that circumspection any more than they can for grasping \nthings 'thematically' but non-circumspectively. If it is to be possible for \nthe ready-to-hand not to emerge from its inconspicuousness, the world \nmust not announce itself. And it is in this that the Being-in-itself of entities \nwhich are ready-to-hand has its phenomenal structure constituted. \nIn such privative expressions as \"inconspicuousness\", \"unobtrusive\u00ad\nness\", and \"non-obstinacy\", what we have in view is a positive pheno\u00ad\nmenal character of the Being of that which is proximally ready-to-hand. \nWith these negative prefixes we have in view the character \u00b7of the ready\u00ad\nto-hand as \"holding itself in\" ; this is what we have our eye upon in the \n\"Being-in-itself\" of something, 1 though 'proximally' we ascribe it to the \npresent-at-hand-to the present-at-hand as that which can be themati\u00ad\ncally ascertained.

If, however, this talk about the 'in-itself' has any \n76 \nontological importance, some interpretation must be called for. This \n\"in-itself\" of Being is something which gets invoked with considerable \nemphasis, mostly in an ontical way, and rightly so from a phenomenal \nstandpoint. But if some ontological assertion is supposed to be given when \nthis is ontically invoked, its claims are not fulfilled by such a procedure. As \nthe foregoing analysis has already made clear, only on the basis of the \nphenomenon of the world can the Being-in-itself of entities within-the\u00ad\nworld be grasped ontologically. \nBut if the world can, in a way, be lit up, it must assuredly be disclosed. \nAnd it has already been disclosed beforehand whenever what is ready-to\u00ad\nhand within-the-world is accessible for circumspective concern. The world \nis therefore something 'wherein' Dasein as an entity already was, and if in \ndetailed awareness of the contents which are thus 'disclosed', but rather that they have \nbeen 'laid open' to us as implicit in what is given, so that they may be made explicit to \nour awareness by further analysis or discrimination of the given, rather than by any \ninference from it. \n1 'Diese \"Un\" meinen den Charakter des Ansichhaltens des Zuhandenen, das, was wir \nmit dem An-sich-sein im Auge haben . . .

These are so far from coinciding that only when they are united \ndoes the concreteness of a definite kind of equipment become possible. \n79 \nNow it is certain that indicating differs in principle from reference as a \nconstitutive state of equipment; it is just as incontestable that the sign in \nits turn is related in a peculiar and even distinctive way to the kind of \nBeing which belongs to whatever equipmental totality may be ready-to\u00ad\nhand in the environment, and to its worldly character. In our concernful \n1 'Es hat den Charakter des Um-zu, seine bestimmte Dienlichkeit, es ist zum Zeigen.' \nThe verb 'dienen', is often followed by an infinitive construction introduced by the \npreposition 'zu'. Similarly the English 'serve' can be followed by an infinitive in such \nexpressions as 'it serves to indicate . . .  \n' In Heidegger's German the 'zu' construction is \ncarried over to the noun 'Dienlichkeit'; the corresponding noun 'serviceability', however, \nis not normally followed by an infinitive, but rather by an expression introduced by 'for' \ne.g. 'serviceability for indicating . . .  ' Since the preposition 'zu' plays an important role in \nthis section and the next, it would be desirable to provide a uniform translation for it. We \nshall, however, translate it as 'for' in such expressions as 'Dienlichkeit zu', but as 'towards' \nin such expressions as 'Wozu' ('towards-which') and 'Dazu' ('towards-this'), retaining \n'in-order-to' for 'Um-zu'. \n"

A sign to mark \nsomething indicates what one is 'at' at any time. Signs always indicate \nprimarily 'wherein' one lives, where one's concern dwells, what sort of \ninvolvement there is with something. 2 \nThe peculiar character of signs as equipment becomes especially clear \nin 'establishing a sign' [\"Zeichenstiftung\"]. This activity is performed in \na circumspective fore-sight [Vorsicht] out of which it arises, and which \nrequires that it be possible for one's particular environment to announce \nitself for circumspection at any time by means of something ready-to\u00ad\nhand, and that this possibility should itself be ready-to-hand. But the \nBeing of what is most closely ready-to-hand within-the-world possesses \nthe character of holding-itself-in and not emerging, which we have \ndescribed above. 3 Accordingly our circumspective dealings in the environ\u00ad\nment require some equipment ready-to-hand which in its character as \nequipment takes over the 'work' of letting something ready-to-hand become \nconspicuous. So when such equipment (signs) gets produced, its conspicuous\u00ad\nness must be kept in mind. But even when signs are thus conspicuous, one \ndoes not let them be present-at-hand at random; they get 'set up' \n[\"angebracht\"] in a definite way with a view towards easy accessibility. \nIn establishing a sign, however, one does not necessarily have to pro\u00ad\nduce equipment which is not yet ready-fo-hand at all. Signs also arise \nwhen one takes as a sign [Zum-Zeichen-nehmen] something that is ready-to\u00ad\nhand already. In this mode, signs \"get established\" in a sense which is \neven more primordial. In indicating, a ready-to-hand equipment totality, \nand even the environment in general, can be provided with an availability \nwhich is circumspectively oriented ; and not only this : establishing a sign \ncan, above all, reveal. What gets taken as a sign becomes accessible only \nthrough its readiness-to-hand. If, for instance, the south wind 'is accepted' \n[\"gilt\"] by the farmer as a sign of rain, then this 'acceptance' [\"Geltung\"] \n-or the 'value' with which the entity is 'invested'-is not a sort of bonus \nover and above what is already present-at-hand in itself-viz, the flow of \nair in a definite geographical direction. The south wind may be meteoro\u00ad\nlogically accessible as something which just occurs ; but it is never present-\n1 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  das \"was kommt\" ist solches, daraufwir uns gefasst machen, bzw. \"nicht gefast \nwaren\", sofern wir uns mit anderem befasten.' \nI 'Das Merkzeichen zeigt, \"woran\" man jeweils ist. Die Zeichen zeigen primir immer \ndas, \"worin\" man lebt, wobei das Besorgen sich aufhaJ.t, welche Bewandtnis es damit \nhat.' On 'Bewandtnis', see note 2, p. 1 15 H. 84 below. \n8 See H. 75-76 above. \n"

With regard to the sign\u00ad\nphenomenon, the following Interpretation may be given: for primitive \nman, the sign coincides with that which is indicated. Not only can the \nsign represent this in the sense of serving as a substitute for what it indic-\nates, but it can do so in such a way that the sign itself always is what it \nindicates. This remarkable coinciding does not mean, however, that the \nsign-Thing has already undergone a certain 'Objectification'-that it has \nbeen experienced as a mere Thing and misplaced into the same realm of \nBeing of the present-at-hand as what it indicates. This 'coinciding' is not \nan identification of things which have hitherto been isolated from each \nother : it consists rather in the fact that the sign has not as yet become free \nfrom that of which it is a sign. Such a use of signs is still absorbed com\u00ad\npletely in Being-towards what is indicated, so that a sign as such cannot \ndetach itself at all. This coinciding is based not on a prior Objectification \nbut on the fact that such Objectification is completely lacking. This means, \nhowever, that signs are not discovered as equipment at all-that ultimately \nwhat is 'ready-to-hand' within-the-world just does not have the kind of \nBeing that belongs to equipment. Perhaps\u00b7 even readiness-to-hand and \nequipment have nothing to contribute [nichts auszurichten] as ontological \nclues in Interpreting the primitive world ; and certainly the ontology of \nThing hood does even less. But if an understanding of Being is constitutive \nfor primitive Dasein and for the primitive world in general, then it is all \nthe more urgent to work out the 'formal' idea of worldhood-<>r at least \nthe idea of a phenomenon modifiable in such a way that all ontological \nassertions to the effect that in a given phenomenal context something is \nnot yet such-and-such or no longer such-and-such, may acquire a positive \nphenomenal meaning in terms of what it is not.1 \nThe foregoing Interpretation of the sign should merely provide phe\u00ad\nnomenal support for our characterization of references or assignments. \nThe relation between sign and reference is threefold. 1 .  Indicating, as a \nway whereby the \"towards-which\" of a serviceability can become con\u00ad\ncrete, is founded upon the equipment-structure as \u00b7such, upon the \"in\u00ad\norder-to\" (assignment). 2. The indicating which the sign does is an \nequipmental character of something ready-to-hand, and as such it belongs \nto a totality of equipment, to a context of assignments or references. \n3\u00b7 The sign is not only ready-to-hand with other equipment, but in its \nreadiness-to-hand the environment becomes in each case explicitly \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n aus dem, was es nicht ist.'

Anything ready-to-hand is, at the worst, \nappropriate for some purposes and inappropriate for others ; and its \n'properties' are, as it were, still bound up in these ways in which it is \nappropriate or inappropriate, 1 just as presence-at-hand, as a possible \nkind of Being for something ready-to-hand, is bound up in readiness-to\u00ad\nhand. Serviceability too, however, as a constitutive state of equipment \n(and serviceability is a reference), is not an appropriateness of some \nentity; it is rather the condition (so far as Being is in question) which \nmakes it possible for the character of such an entity to be defined by its \nappropriatenesses. But what, then, is \"reference\" or \"assignment\" to \nmean ? To say that the Being of the ready-to-hand has the structure of \nassignment or reference means that it has in itself the character of hauing \n84 \nbeen assigned or referred [Verwiesenheit]. An entity is discovered when it has \nbeen assigned or referred to something, and ,referred as that entity which \nit is. With any such entity there is an involvement which it has in some\u00ad\n:hing. 2 The character of Being which belongs to the ready-to-hand is \nust such an inuoluement. If something has an involvement, this implies \netting it be involved in something. The relationship ofthe \"with . . .  in . . . \" \nhall be indicated by the term \"assignment\" or \"reference\". 3 \n1 The words 'property' and 'appropriateness' reflect the etymological connection of \n[eidegger's 'Eigenschaft' and \"Geeignetheit'. \nz 'Es hat mit ihm bei etwas sein Bewenden.' The terms 'Bewenden' and 'Bewandtnis' are \nmong the most difficult for the translator. Their root meaning has to do with the way \n>mething is already 'turning' when one lets it 'go its own way', 'run its course', follow \ns 'bent' or 'tendency', or finish 'what it is about', 'what it is up to' or 'what it is \nlVolved in'. The German expressions, however, have no simple English equivalents, \nut are restricted to a rather special group of idioms such as the following, which we \nave taken from Wildhagen and Heraucourt's admirable English-Gmnan, Gmnan-English \n>ictionary (Volume II, Wiesbaden 1953) : 'es dabei bewenden lasen'-'to leave it at \n1at, to let it go at that, to let it rest there' ; 'und dabei hatte es sein Bewenden'-'and \n[}ere the matter ended'; 'dabei muss es sein Bewenden haben'-'there the matter must \nest'-'that must suffice' ; 'die Sache hat eine ganz andere Bewandtnis'-'the case is \ntuite different' ; 'damit hat es seine besondere Bewaridtnis'-'there is something peculiar \n,bout it; thereby hangs a tale' ; 'damit hat est folgende Bewandtnis'-'the matter \ns as follows'. \nWe have tried to render both 'Bewenden' and 'Bewandtnis' by expressions including \n!ither 'involve' or 'involvement'. But the contexts into which these words can easily be \nfitted in ordinary English do not correspond very well to those which are possible for \n'Bewenden' and 'Bewandtnis'. Our task is further complicated by the emphasis which \nHeidegger gives to the prepositions 'mit' and 'bei' in connection with 'Bewenden' and \n'Bewandtnis'. In passages such as the present one, it would be more idiomatic to leave \nthese prepositions untranslated and simply write : 'Any such entity is involved in doing \nsomething', or 'Any such entity is involved in some activity'. But 'mit' and \u00b7\u032dei' receive so \nmuch attention in this connection that in contexts such as this we shall sometimes translate \nthem as 'with' and 'in', though elsewhere we shall handle 'bei' very differently. (The \nreader must bear in mind that the kind of 'involvement' with which we are here concerned \nis always an involvement in some activiry, which one is performing, not an involvement \nin circumstances in which one is 'caught' or 'entangled'.) \n3 'In Bewandtnis liegt: bewenden lasen mit etwas bei etwas.

With any such entity as \nentity, there is some involvement. The fact that it has such an involvement \nis ontological?J definitive for the Being of such an entity, and is not an \nontical assertion about it. That in which it is involved is the \"towards\u00ad\nwhich\" of serviceability, and the \"for-which\" of usability.1 With the \n\"towards-which\" of serviceability there can again be an involvement: \nwith this thing, for instance, which is ready-to-hand, and which we \naccordingly call a \"hamer\", there is an involvement in hammering; \nwith hammering, there is an involvement in making something fast; \nwith making something fast, there is an involvement in protection against \nbad weather ; and this protection 'is' for the sake of [ um-willen] providing \nshelter for Dasein-that is to say, for the sake of a possibility of Dasein's \nBeing. Whenever something ready-to-hand has an involvement with it, \nwhat involvement this is, has in each case been outlined in advance in \nterms of the totality of such involvements. In a workshop, for example, the \ntotality of involvements which is constitutive for the ready-to-hand in its \nreadiness-to-hand, is 'earlier' than any single item of equipment; so too \nfor the farmstead with all its utensils and outlying lands. But the totality \nof involvements itself goes back ultimately to a \"towards-which\" in \nwhich there is no further involvement : this \"towards-which\" is not an \nentity with the kind of Being that belongs to what is ready-to-hand within \na world ; it is rather an entity whose Being is defined as Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, and to whose state of Being, worldhood itselfbelongs. This primary \n\"towards-which\" is not just another \"towards-this\" as something in which \nan involvement is possible. The primary 'towards-which' is a \"for-the\u00ad\nsake-of-which\".2 But the 'for-the-sake-of' always pertains to the Being of \n. . .  bei . . . \" soil durch den Terminus Verweisung angezeigt werden.' Here the point seems \nto be that if something has an 'involvement' in the sense of 'Bewandtnis' (or rather, if \nthere is such an involvement 'with' it), the thing which has this involvement has been \n'assigned' or 'referred' for a certain activity or purpose 'in' which it may be said to be \ninvolved. \n1 'Bewandtnis ist das Sein des innerweltlichen Seienden, darauf es je schon zunachst \nfreigegeben ist. Mit ihm als Seiendem hat es je eine Bewandtnis. Dieses, clas es eine \nBewandtnis hat, ist die ontologische Bestimmung des Seins dieses Seienden, nicht eine \nontische Aussage tiber das Seiende. Das Wobei es die Bewandtnis hat, ist das Wozu der \nDienlichkeit, das Wofiir der Verwendbarkeit.' This passage and those which follow are \nhard to translate because Heidegger is using three carefully differentiated prepositions \n('zu', 'fur', and 'auf') where English idiom needs only 'for'. We can say that something is \nserviceable, usable, or applicable 'for' a purpose. and that it may be freed or given free \nrein 'for' some kind of activity. In German, however, it will be said to have 'Dienlichkeit \nzu \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ', 'Verwendbarkeitfur . . .  '; and it will be 'freigegeben arif \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n '. In the remainder of \nthis section we shall use 'for' both for 'fiir' and for 'auf' as they occur in these expressions; \nwe shall, however, continue to use 'towards-which' for the 'Wozu' of 'Dienlichkeit'.

And therewith we Interpret the \n85 \nmeaning of previously freeing what is proximally ready-to-hand within\u00ad\nthe-world. Previously letting something 'be' does not mean that we must \nfirst bring it into its Being and produce it; it means rather that something \nwhich is already an 'entity' must be discovered in its readiness-to-hand, \nand that we must thus let the entity which has this Being be encountered. \nThis 'a priori' letting-something-be-involved is the condition for the \npossibility of encountering anything ready-to-hand, so that Dasein, in its \nontical dealings with the entity thus encountered, can thereby let it be \ninvolved in the on tical sense. 2 On the other hand, if letting something \nbe involved is understood ontologically, what is then pertinent is the \nfreeing of everything ready-to-hand as ready-to-hand, no matter whether, \ntaken ontically, it is involved thereby, or whether it is rather an entity of \nprecisely such a sort that ontically it is not involved thereby. Such entities \nare, proximally and for the most part, those with which we concern \nourselves when we do not let them 'be' as we have discovered that they \nare, but work upon them, make improvements in them, or smash them \nto pieces. \nWhen we speak of having already let something be involved, so that it \nhas been freed for that involvement, we are using a perfect tense a priori \nwhich characterizes the kind of Being belonging to Dasein itself. 3 Letting \nan entity be involved, if we understand this ontologically, consists in \npreviously freeing it for [auf] its readiness-to-hand within the environment. \nWhen we let something be involved, it must be involved in something; \nand in terms of this \"in-which\", the \"with-which\" of this involvement \n1 'Bewendenlasen bedeutet ontisch; innerhalb eines faktischen Besorgens ein Zuhan\u00ad\ndenes so und so sein lassen, wie es nunmehr ist und damit es so ist.' \n2 ' \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n es im ontischen Sinne dabei bewenden lassen kann.'

These \nrelationships are bound up with one another as a primordial totality; \nthey are what they are a s this signifying [Be-deuten) in which Dasein \ngives itself beforehand its Being-in-the-world as something to be under\u00ad\nstood. The relational totality of this signifying we call \"significance\". This \nis what makes up the structure of the world-the structure of that wherein \nDasein as such already is. Dasein, in its familiarity with significance, is the \nontical condition for the possibility of discovering entities which are encountered in a \nworld with involvement (readiness-to-hand) as their kind of Being, and which can \nthus make themselves known as they are in themselves [in seinem An-sich]. Dasein \nas such is always something of this sort; along with its Being, a context of \nthe ready-to-hand is already essentially discovered : Dasein, in so far as it \n1 'Das . . .  Verstehen . . .  halt die angezeigten Bezlige in einer vorgangigen Erschlossen\u00ad\nheit. Im vertrauten Sich-darin-halten halt es sich diese vor als das, worin sich sein Ver\u00ad\nweisen bewegt.' The context suggests that Heidegger's 'diese' refers to the relationships \n(Bezlige) rather than to the disclosedness (Erschlossenheit), though the latter interpreta\u00ad\ntion seems a bit more plausible grammatically. \n2 'Das Verstehen llisst sich in und von diesen Bezligen selbst verweisen.' It is not \nentirely clear whether 'von' should be translated as 'of', 'from', or 'by'. \n3 'he-deuten'. While Heidegger ordinarily writes this word without a hyphen (even, for \ninstance, in the next sentence), he here takes pains to hyphenate it so as to suggest that \netymologically it consists of the intensive prefix 'be-' followed by the verb 'deuten'-to \n'interpret', 'explain' or 'point to' something. We shall continue to follow our convention \nof usually translating 'bedeuten' and 'Bedeutung' by 'signify' and 'signification' respec\u00ad\ntively, reserving 'significance' for 'Bedeutsamkeit' (or, in a few cases, for 'Bedeutung'). \nBut these translations obscure the underlying meanings which Heidegger is emphasizing \nin this pasage. \n"

And inasmuch as Relations are always 'something thought', \nhas not the Being of entities within-the-world been dissolved into 'pure \n88 \nthinking' ? \nWithin our present field of investigation the following structures and \ndimensions of ontological problematics, as we have repeatedly empha\u00ad\nsized, must be kept in principle distinct : 1. the Being of those entities \nwithin-the-world which we proximally encounter-readiness-to-hand; \n2. the Being of those entities which we can come across and whose nature \nwe can determine if we discover them in their own right by going through \nthe entities proximally encountered-presence-at-hand; 3\u00b7 the Being of \nthat on tical condition which makes it possible for entities within-the-world \nto be discovered at all-the worldhood of the world.

The verb 'anweisen', like 'verweisen', can often be \ntranslated as 'assign', particularly in the sense in which one assigns or allots a place to \nsomething, or in the sense in which one gives an 'assignment' to someone by instructing \nhim how to proceed. The past participle 'angewiesen' can thus mean 'assigned' in either \nof these senses; but it often takes on the connotation of'being dependent on' something or \neven 'at the mercy' of something. In this passage we have tried to compromise by using \nthe verb 'submit'. Other passages call for other idioms, and no single standard translation \nseems feasible. \n"

What kind of understanding of Being does \nhe have when he defines the Being of these entities ? The term for the \nBeing of an entity that is in itself, is \"substantia\".

So even created entities can be called \"substance\" with some right. \nRelative to God, of course, these entities need to be produced and sus\u00b7 \ntained ; but within the realm of created entities-the 'world' in the sense \nof ens creatum-there are things which 'are in need of no other entity' \n"

In the assertions 'God is' and 'the world is', we assert Being. \nThis word 'is', however, cannot be meant to apply to these entities in the \nsame sense (uvvwvvp.ws, univoce) , when between them there is an infinite \ndifference of Being; if the signification of 'is' were univocal, then what is \ncreated would be viewed as if it were uncreated, or the uncreated would \nbe reduced to the status of something created.

'Being is not a \nReal predicate,' says Kant, 1 who is merely repeating Descartes' principle. \nThus the possibility of a pure problematic of Being gets renounced in \nprinciple, and a way is sought for arriving at those definite characteristics \nof substance which we have designated above. Because 'Being' is not in \nfact accessible as an entity, it is expressed through attributes-definite \ncharacteristics of the entities under comideration, characteristics which \nthemselves are.2 Being is not expressed through just any such charac\u00ad\nteristics, but rather through those satisfying in the purest manner that \nmeaning of \"Being\" and \"substantiality\", which has still been tacitly \npresupposed. To the substantia finita as res corporea, what must primarily \nbe 'assigned' [\"Zuweisung\"] is the extensio. \"Quin et facilius intelligimus \nsubstantiam extensam, vel substantiam cogitantem, quam substantiam solam, \nomisso eo quod cogitet vel sit extensa\" ;xvu for substantiality is detachable \nratione tantum; it is not detachable realiter, nor can we come across it in \nthe way in which we come across those entities themselves which a r e  \nsubstantially. \nThus the ontological grounds for defining the 'world' as res extensa have \nbeen made plain: they lie in the idea of substantiality, which not only \nremains unclarified in the meaning of its Being, but gets passed off as \nsomething incapable of clarification, and gets represented indirectly by \nway of whatever substantial property belongs most pre-eminently to the \nparticular substance. Moreover, in this way of defining a substance \nthrough some substantial entity, lies the reason why the term \"substance\" \nis used in two ways. What is here intended is substantiality; and it getc; \nunderstood in terms of a characteristic of substance-a characteristic \nwhich is itself an entity.3 Because something ontical is made to underlie \nthe ontological, the expression \"substantia\" functions sometimes with a \nsignification which is ontological, sometimes with one which is ontical, but \nmostly with one which is hazily ontico-ontological. Behind this slight \ndifference of signification, however, there lies hidden a failure to master \nthe basic problem of Being. To treat this adequately, we must 'track \ndown' the equivocations in the right way. He who attempts this sort of \nthing does not just 'busy himself' with 'merely verbal significations' ; he \nmust venture forward into the most primordial problematic of the 'things \n95 \nthemselves' to get such 'nuances' straightened out. \n1 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure &ason, Transcendental Dialectic, Bok II, chapter III, \nSection 4\u00b7 \nB ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n seiende Bestimmtheiten des betreffenden Seienden . .  .' \na ' . . .  a us einer seienden Beschaffenheit der Substanz.' \n"

The kind of Being which belongs to entities within-the-world \nis something which they themselves might have been permitted to present ; \nbut Descartes does not let them do so. 1  Instead he prescribes for the world \nits 'real' Being, as it were, on the basis of an idea of Being whose source \nhas not been unveiled and which has not been demonstrated in its own \nright-an idea in which Being is equated with constant presence-at-hand. \nThus his ontology of the world is not primarily determined by his leaning \ntowards mathematics, a science which he chances to \nesteem very \nhighly, but rather by his ontological orientation in principle towards \nBeing as constant presence-at-hand, which mathematical knowledge \nis exceptionally well suited to grasp. In this way Descartes explicitly \nswitches \nover philosophically from the \ndevelopment \nof traditional \nontology to \nmodern \nmathematical physics \nand \nits \ntranscendental \nfoundations. \nThe problem of how to get appropriate access to entities within-the\u00ad\nworld is one which Descartes feels no need to raise.

Sensatio (a\u00a3a87Jats), as opposed to \nintellectio, still remains possible as a way of access to entities by a beholding \nwhich is perceptual in character ; but Descartes presents his 'critique' of \nit because he is oriented ontologically by these principles. \nDescartes knows very well that entities do not proximally show them\u00ad\nselves in their real Being. What is 'proximally' given is this waxen Thing \nwhich is coloured, flavoured, hard, and cold in definite ways, and which \ngives off its own special sound when struck.

Section 1 9) .  \nHardness gets taken as resistance. But neither hardness nor resistance \nis understood in a phenomenal sense, as something experienced in itself \nwhose nature can be determined in such an experience. For Descartes, \nresistance amounts to no more than not yielding place-that is, not \nundergoing any change of location. So if a Thing resists, this means that \nit stays in a definite location relatively to some other Thing which is \nchanging its location, or that it is changing its own location with a velocity \nwhich permits the other Thing to 'catch up' with it. But when the exper\u00ad\nience of hardness is Interpreted this way, the kind of Being which belongs \nto sensory perception is obliterated, and so is any possibility that the \nentities encountered in such perception should be grasped in their Being. \nDescartes takes the kind of Being which belongs to the perception of \nsomething, and translates it into the only kind he knows : the perception \nof something becomes a definite way of Being-present-at-hand-side-by\u00ad\nside of two res extensae which are present-at-hand ; the way in which their \nmovements are related is itself a mode of that extensio by which the \npresence-at-hand of the corporeal Thing is primarily characterized.

Hardness and resistance do not show themselves at all unless an \nentity has the kind of Being which Dasein--or at least something living\u00ad\npossesses. \nThus Descartes' discussion of possible kinds of access to entities within\u00ad\nthe-world is dominated by an idea of Being which has been gathered from \na definite realm of these entities themselves. \ng8 \nThe idea of Being as permanent presence-at-hand not only gives \nDescartes a motive for identifying entities within-the-world with the world \nin general, and for providing so extreme a definition of their Being; it \nalso keeps him from bringing Dasein's ways of behaving into view in a \nmanner which is ontologically appropriate.

In his doctrine \nof the res cogitans and the res extensa, Descartes not only wants to formulate \nthe problem of 'the \"I\" and the world' ; he claims to have solved it in a \nradical manner. His Meditations make this plain. (Sec especially Medita\u00ad\ntions I and VI.) By taking his basicontological orientation from traditional \nsources and not subjecting it to positive criticism, he has made it impos\u00ad\nsible to lay bare any primordial ontological problematic of Dasein ; this \nhas inevitably obstructed his view of the phenomenon of the world, and \nhas made it possible for the ontology of the 'world' to be compressed into \nthat of certain entities within-the-world. The foregoing discussion should \nhave proved this. \nOne might retort, however, that even if in point offact both the problem \nof the world and the Being of the entities encountered environmentally \nas closest to us remain concealed, Descartes has still laid the basis for \ncharacterizing ontologically that entity within-the-world upon which, in \nits very Being, every other entity is founded-material Nature.

The nouns 'Entfernung' and 'Entfernheit' can usually be \ntranslated by 'removing', 'removal', 'remoteness', or even 'distance'. In this passage, \nhowever, Heidegger is calling attention to the fact that these words are derived from the \nstem 'fern-' {'far' or 'distant') and the privative prefix 'ent-'. Usually this prefix would be \nconstrued as merely intensifying the notion of separation or distance expressed in the \n'fern-'; but Heidegger chooses to construe it as more strictly privative, so that the verb \n'entfernen' will be taken to mean abolishing a distance or farness rather than enhancing it. \nIt is as if by the very act of recognizing the 'remoteness' of something, we have in a sense \nbrought it closer and made it less 'remote'. \nApparently there is no word in English with an etymological structure quite parallel \n"

De-severance discovers remoteness; and \nremoteness, like distance, is a determinate categorial characteristic of \nentities whose nature is not that of Dasein. De-severance*, however, is \nan existentiale; this must be kept in mind. Only to the extent that entities \nare revealed for Dasein in their deseveredness [Entferntheit], do 'remote\u00ad\nnesses' [\"Entfernungen\"] and distances with regard to other things \nbecome accessible in entities within-the-world themselves. Two points are \njust as little desevered from one another as two Things, for neither of these \ntypes of entity has the kind of Being which would make it capable of \ndesevering. They merely have a measurable distance between them, \nwhich we can come across in our de-severing. \nProximally and for the most part, de-severing3 is a circumspective \nto that of 'entfernen' ; perhaps 'dissever' comes the nearest, for this too is a verb of separa\u00ad\ntion in which a privative prefix is used as an intensive. We have coined the similar verb \n'desever' in the hope that this will suggest Heidegger's meaning when 'remove' and its \nderivatives seem inappropriate. But with 'desever', one cannot slip back and forth from \none sense to another as easily as one can with 'entfernen'; so we have resorted to the \nexpedient of using both 'desever' and 'remove' and their derivatives, depending upon the \nsense we feel is intended. Thus 'entfernen' will generally be rendered by 'remove' or \n'desever', 'entfernt' by 'remote' or 'desevered'. Since Heidegger is careful to distinguish \n'Entfernung' and 'Entferntheit', we shall usually translate these by 'deseverance' and \n'remoteness' respectively; in the few cases where these translations do not seem appro\u00ad\npriate, we shall subjoin the German word in brackets. \nOur problem is further complicated by Heidegger's practise of occasionally putting a \nhyphen after the prefix 'ent-', presumably to emphasize its privative character. In such \ncases we shall write 'de-sever', 'de-severance', etc. Unfortunately, however, there are \ntypographical discrepancies between the earlier and later editions. Som\u0230 of the earlier \nhyphens occur at the ends of lines and have been either intentionally or inadvertently \nomitted in resetting the type; some appear at the end of the line in the later editions, but \nnot in the earlier ones; others have this position in both editions. We shall indicate each \nof these ambiguous cases with an asterisk, supplying a hyphen only if there seems to be a \ngood reason for doing so. \nOn 'Ausrichtung' see our note 2, p. 135, H. 102 above. \n1 'Abstand'. Heidegger uses three words which might be translated as 'distance' : \n'Ferne' (our 'farness'), 'Entfernung' (our 'deseverance'), and 'Abstand' ('distance' in the \nsense of a measurable interval). We shall reserve 'distance' for 'Abstand'. \n2 'Entfernen* besagt ein Verschwindenmachen der Ferne, d. h. der Entferntheit von \netwas, Naherung.' \ns This hyphen is found only in the later editions, \n"

Though we may know these \ndistances exactly, this knowledge still remains blind ; it does not have the \nfunction of discovering the environment circumspectively and bringing it \nclose ; this knowledge is used only in and for a concernful Being which \ndoes not measure stretches-a Being towards the world that 'matters' to \none [ .\n.\n\u2022\n Sein zu der einen \"angehenden\" Welt]. \nWhen one is oriented beforehand towards 'Nature' and 'Objectively' \nmeasured distances of Things, one is inclined to pass off such estimates \nand interpretations of deseverance as 'subjective'. Yet this 'subjectivity' \nperhaps uncovers the 'Reality' of the world at its most Real ; it has nothing \nto do with 'subjective' arbitrariness or subjectivistic 'ways of taking' an \nentity which 'in itself' is otherwise. The circumspective de-severing of Dasein' s \neverydayness reveals the Being-in-itself of the 'true world'-of that entity which \nDasein, as something existing, is already alongside. 2 \nWhen one is primarily and even exclusively oriented towards remote-\nnesses as measured distances, the primordial spatiality of Being-in is \nconcealed. That which is presumably 'closest' is by no means that which \nI07 \nis at the smallest distance 'from us'. It lies in that which is desevered to an \naverage extent when we reach for it, grasp it, or look at it. Because Dasein \nis essentially spatial in the way of de-severance, its dealings always keep \nwithin an 'environment' which is desevered from it with a certain leeway \n[Spielraum] ; accordingly our seeing and hearing always go proximally \nbeyond what is distantially 'closest'. Seeing and hearing are distance-\nsenses [Fernsinne] not because they are far-reaching, but because it is in \nthem that Dasein as deseverant mainly dwells. When, for instance, a man \nwears a pair of spectacles which are so close to him distantially that they \nare 'sitting on his nose', they are environmentally more remote from hiin \nthan the picture on the opposite wall. Such equipment has so little \ncloseness that often it is proximally quite impossible to find. Equipment \nfor seeing-and likewise for hearing, such as the telephone receiver-has \nwhat we have designated as the inconspicuousness of the proximally ready\u00ad\nto-hand. So too, for instance, does the street, as equipment for walking. \nOne feels the touch of it at every step as one walks ; it is seemingly the \n\u00b7 closest and Realest of all that is ready-to-hand, and it slides itself, as it \n1 'vorkommt' ; ' \"Vorkommen\" '. In general 'vorkommen' may be translated as \n'occur', and is to be thought of as applicable strictly to the present-at-hand. In this \npasage, however, it is applied to the ready-to-hand; and a translation which calls \nattention to its etymological structure seeilll to be called for. \nII 'Das wnsichtige Ent-fernen tkr Alltiiglichkeit rks Daseins enttkckt das An-sich-sein tkr \"wahrm \nWelt\", des Seientkn, bei dem Dasein als existief'mtks je schon ist.' \n"

Circumspective concern decides as to the closeness \nand farness of what is proximally ready-to-hand environmentally. What\u00ad\never this concern dwells alongside beforehand is what is closest, and this \nis what regulates our de-severances. \nIfDasein, in its concern, brings something close by, this does not signify \nthat it fixes something at a spatial position with a minimal distance from \nsome point of the body. When something is close by, this means that it is \nwithin the range of what is proximally ready-to-hand for circumspection. \nBringing-close is not oriented towards the I-Thing encumbered with a \nbody, but towards concernful Being-in-the-world-that is, towards what\u00ad\never is proximally encountered in such Being. It follows, moreover, that \nDasein's spatiality is not to be defined by citing the position at which \nsome corporeal Thing is present-at-hand. Of course we say that even \nDasein always occupies a place. But this 'occupying' must be distinguished \nin principle from Being-ready-to-hand at a place in some particular \nregion. Occupying a place must be conceived as a desevering of the \nenvironmentally ready-to-hand into a region which has been circumspec\u00ad\ntively discovered in advance. Dasein understands its \"here\" [Hier] in \nterms of its environmental \"yonder\". The \"here\" does not mean the \n\"where\" of something present-at-hand, but rather the \"whereat\" [Wobei] \nof a de-severant Being-alongside, together with this de-severance. Dasein, \nin accordance with its spatiality, is proximally never here but yonder; \nfrom this \"yonder\" it comes back to its \"here\" ; and it comes back to its \n108 \n\"here\" only in the way in which it interprets its concernful Being\u00ad\ntowards in terms of what is ready-to-hand yonder. This becomes quite \nplain if we consider a certain phenomenal peculiarity of the de-severance \nstructure of Being-in. \nAs Being-in-the-world, Dasein maintains itself essentially in a de\u00ad\nsevering. This de-severance-the farness of the ready-to-hand from Dasein \nitself-is something that Dasein can never cross over. Of course the remote\u00ad\nness of something ready-to-hand from Dasein can show up as a distance \nfrom it, 1 if this remoteness is determined by a relation to some Thing \nwhich gets thought of as present-at-hand at the place Dasein has formerly \noccupied. Dasein can subsequently traverse the \"between\" of this distance, \nbut only in such a way that the distance itself becomes one which has been \ndesevered *. So little has Dasein crossed over its de-severance that \nit has rather taken it along with it and keeps doing so constantly ; for \n1 ' \u2022 \u2022 .  kann zwar selbst von diesem als Abstand vorfindlich werden . .  .' \n"

But what does this \nsignify except that whenever this happens I necessarily orient myself both \ni n  and from my being already alongside a world which is 'familiar' ?1 The \nequipment-context of a world must have been presented to Dasein. That \nI am already in a world is no less constitutive for the possibility of orienta\u00ad\ntion than is the feeling for right and left. While this state of Dasein's \nBeing is an obvious one, we are not thereby justified in suppressing the \nontologically constitutive role which it plays. Even Kant does not suppress \nit, any more than any other Interpretation of Dasein. Yet the fact that \nthis is a state of which we constantly make use, does not exempt us from \nproviding a suitable ontological explication, but rather demands one. \nThe psychological Interpretation according to which the \"I\" has some\u00ad\nthing 'in the memory' [\"im Gedachtnis\"] is at bottom a way of alluding to \nthe existentially constitutive stateofBeing-in-the-world. Since Kant fails to \nI I  o \nsee this structure, he also fails to recognize all the interconnections which \nthe Constitution of any possible orientation implies.

Even Kant, of course, has not taken orientation as a \ntheme for Interpretation. He merely wants to show that every orientation \nrequires a 'subjective principle'. Here 'subjective' is meant to signify \nthat this principle is a priori. 2 Nevertheless, the a priori character of directed\u00ad\nness with regard to right and.left is based upon the 'subjective' a priori of \nBeing-in-the-world, which has nothing to do with any determinate \ncharacter restricted beforehand to a worldless subject. \nDe-severance and directionality, as constitutive characteristics of Being\u00ad\nin, are determinative for Dasein's spatiality-for its being concernfully \nand circumspectively in space, in a space discovered and within-the-world. \nOnly the explication we have just given for the spatiality of the ready-to\u00ad\nhand within-the-world and the spatiality of Being-in-the-world, will \nprovide the prerequisites for working out the phenomenon of the world's \nspatiality and formulating the ontological problem of space. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n in und aus einem je schon sein bei einer \"bekannten\" Welt.'

This discovery, which is founded upon the worldhood of the world, \nis one which we have characterized as freeing entities for a totality of \ninvolvements. Freeing something and letting it be involved, is accom\u00ad\nplished by way of referring or assigning oneself circumspectively, and this \nin turn is based upon one's previously understanding significance. We \nhave now shown that circumspective Being-in-the-world is spatial. And \nonly because Dasein is spatial in the way of de-severanc\u01f4 and directionality \ncan what is ready-to-hand within-the-world be encountered in its spat\u00ad\niality. To free a totality of involvements is, equiprimordially, to let some\u00ad\nthing be involved at a region, and to do so by de-severing and giving \ndirectionality; this amounts to freeing the spatial belonging-somewhere of \nthe ready-to-hand. In that significance with which Dasein (as concernful \nBeing-in) is familiar, lies the essential co-disclosedness of space.1 \nThe space which is thus disclosed with the worldhood of the world still \nlacks the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions. In this disclosedness \nwhich is closest to us, space, as the pure \"wherein\" in which positions are \nordered by measurement and the situations of things are determined, still \nremains hidden. In the phenomenon of the region we have already indi\u00ad\ncated that on the basis of which space is discovered beforehand in Dasein. \nBy a 'region\" we have understood the \"whither\" to which an equipment\u00ad\ncontext ready-to-hand might possibly belong, when that context is of \nsuch a sort that it can be encountered as directionally desevered-that \nis, as having been placed. 2 This belongingness [Gehorigkeit] is determined \nI I I \nin terms of the significance which is constitutive for the world, and it \nArticulates the \"hither\" and \"thither\" within the possible \"whither\". In \ngeneral the \"whither\" gets prescribed by a referential totality which has \nbeen made fast in a \"for-the-sake-of-which\" of concern, and within which \nletting something be involved by freeing it, assigns itself. With anything \nencountered as ready-to-hand there is always an involvement in [bei] a \nregion. To the totality of involvements which makes up the Being of the \nready-to-hand within-the-world, there belongs a spatial involvement \nwhich has the character of a region. By reason of such an involvement, \nthe ready-to-hand becomes something which we can come across and \nascertain as having form and direction. 3 With the facti cal Being of \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n die wesenhafte Miterschlossenheit des Raumes.' \n2 'Wir verstehen sie als das Wohin der moglichen Zugehorigkeit des zuhandenen \nZeugzusammenhanges, der als ausgerichtet entfernter, d. h. platzierter sol! begegnen \nkonnen.' \n3 'Auf deren Grunde wird das Zuhandene nach Form und Rich tung vorfindlich und \nbestimmbar'.

To characterize \nthese ontologically is to do so existentially. We must therefore pose the \nquestion correctly and outline the procedure for bringing into view a \nbroader phenomenal domain of Dasein's everydayness. By directing our \nresearches towards the phenomenon which is to provide us with an answer \nto the question of the \"who\", we shall be led to certain structures ofDasein \nwhich are equiprimordial with Being-in-the-world: Being-with and Dasein-\nwith [Mitsein und Mitdasein]. In this kind of Being is grounded the mode \nof everyday Being-one's-Self [Selbstsein] ; the explication of this mode wil \n1 'Das Man'. In German one may write 'man glaubt' where in French one would \nwrite 'on croit', or in English 'they believe', 'one believes', or 'it is believed'. But the \nGerman 'man' and the French 'on' are specialized for. such co\u016estructio\u016f in !' .way i_n \nwhich the pronouns 'they', 'one', and 'it' are not. There IS accordmgly no smgl\u0170 1rl;iomauc \ntranslation for the German 'man' which will not sometimes lend itself to amb1gwty, and \nin general we have chosen whichever construction seems the most appropriate in its \ncontext. But when Heidegger introduces this word with a definite ru:ticle and .writes :das \nMan', as he does very often in this chapter, we shall translate th1s expres1on as the \n\"they\" ', trusting that the reader will not take this too literally. \n"

An Approach to the Existential Question of the \" Who\" of Dasein \nThe answer to the question of who Dasein is, is one that was seemingly \ngiven in Section g, where we indicated formally the basic characteristics \nof Dasein. Dasein is an entity which is in each case I myself; its Being is \nin each case mine. This definition indicates an ontologically constitutive state, \nbut it does no more than indicate it. At the same time this tells us ontically \n(though in a rough and ready fashion) that in each case an \"I\"-not \nOthers-is this entity. The question of the \"who\" answers itself in terms \nof the \"I\" itself, the 'subject', the 'Self'.1 The \"who\" is what maintains \nitself as something identical throughout changes in its Experiences and \nways of behaviour, and which relates itself to this changing multiplicity \nin so doing. Ontologically we understand it as something which is in \neach case already constantly present-at-hand, both in and for a closed \nrealm, and which lies at the basis, in a very special sense, as the subjectum. \nAs something selfsame in manifold otherness, 2 it has the character of the \nSelf. Even if one rejects the \"soul substance\" and the Thinghood of con\u00ad\nsciousness, or denies that a person is an object, ontologically one is still \npositing something whose Being retains the meaning of present-at-hand, \nwhether it does so explicitly or not. Substantiality is the ontological clue \nfor determining which entity is to provide the answer to the question of \nthe \"who\". Dasein is tacitly conceived in advance as something present-\n! I 5 \nat-hand. This meaning of Being is always implicated in any case where \nthe Being of Dasein has been left indefinite. Yet presence-at-hand is the \nkind of Being which belongs to entities whose character is not that of Dasein. \nThe assertion that it is I who in each case Dasein is, is ontically obvious; \nbut this must not mislead us into supposing that the route for an onto\u00ad\nlogical Interpretation of what is 'given' in this way has thus been unmis\u00ad\ntakably prescribed. Indeed it remains questionable whether even the mere \nontical content of the above assertion does proper justice to the stock of \nphenomena belonging to everyday Dasein. It could be that the \"who\" of \neveryday Dasein just is not the \"I myself\". \n1 'dem \"Selbst\" '. While we shall ordinarily translate the intensivt 'selbst' by the corre\u00ad\nsponding English intensi\":es 'itself', 'oneself', 'myself', etc., according to the context, we \nshall translate the substantwe 'Selbst' by the substantive 'Self' with a capital. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n als Selbiges in der vielfaltigen Andersheit . .  .' While the words 'identisch' and \n's\u00ccl\u032big' .\nare virtually synonyms in ordinary- German, Heidegger seems to be intimating a \nd1stmctwn between them. We shall accordmgly translate the former by 'identical' and the \nlatter by 'selfsame' to show its etymological connection with 'selbst'. Cf. H. 130 below. \n"

And what is more indubitable than the givenness of the \"I\" ? \nAnd does not this givenness tell us that if we aim to work this out prim\u00ad\nordially, we must disregard everything else that is 'given'-not only a \n'world' that is [einer seienden \"Welt\"], but even the Being of other 'l's ? \nThe kind of \"giving\" we have here is the mere, formal, reflective \nawareness of the \"I\" ; and perhaps what it gives is indeed evident.1 This \ninsight even affords access to a phenomenological problematic in its own \nright, which has in principle the signification of providing a framework \nas a 'formal phenomenology of consciousness'. \nIn this context of an existential analytic of factical Dasein, the question \narises whether giving the \"I\" in the way we have mentioned discloses \nDasein in its everydayness, if it discloses Dasein at all. Is it then obvious \na priori that access to Dasein must be gained only by mere reflective \nawareness of the \"I\" of actions? What if this kind of 'giving-itself' on \nthe part of Dasein should lead our existential analytic astray and do so, \nindeed, in a manner grounded in the Being ofDasein itself? Perhaps when \nDasein addresses itself in the way which is closest to itself, it always says \n\"I am this entity\", and in the long run says this loudest when it is 'not' \nthis entity. Dasein is in each case mine, and this is its constitution; but \nwhat if this should be the very reason why, proximally and for the most \nI I 6 \npart, Dasein is not itself? What if the aforementioned approach, starting \nwith the givenness of the \"I\" to Dasein itself, and with a rather patent self\u00ad\ninterpretation of Dasein, should lead the existential analytic, as it were, \ninto a pitfall? If that which is accessible by mere \"giving\" can be deter\u00ad\nmined, there is presumably an ontological horizon for determining it; \nbut what if this horizon should remain in principle undetermined ? It may \nwell be that it is always ontically correct to say of this entity that 'I' am it. \nYet the ontological analytic which makes use of such assertions must make \ncertain reservations about them in principle. The word 'I' is to be \n1 'Vielleicht ist in der Tat das, was diese Art von Gebung, das schlichte, formale, \nreflektive Ichvemehmen gibt, evident.' \n"

In clarifying Being-in-the-world we have shown that \na bare subject without a world never 'is' proximally, nor is it ever given. \nAnd so in the end an isolated \"I\" without Others is just as far from being \nproximally given.i If, however, 'the Others' already are there with us [mit \ndasind] in Being-in-the-world, and ifthis is ascertained phenomenally, even \nthis should not mislead us into supposing that the ontological structure of \nwhat is thus 'given' is obvious, requiring no investigation. Our task is to \nmake visible phenomenally the species to which this Dasein-with in closest \neverydayness belongs, and to Interpret it in a way which is ontologically \nappropriate. \nJust as the ontical obviousness of the Being-in-itself of entities within\u00ad\nthe-world misleads us into the conviction that the meaning of this Being \nis obvious ontologically, and makes us overlook the phenomenon of the \nworld, the ontical obviousness of the fact that Dasein is in each case mine, \nalso hides the possibility that the ontological problematic which belongs \nto it has been led astray.

Certainly not. Of \nthe ways in which we formally indicated the constitution of Dasein's Being \nin Sections 9 and 12 above, the one we have been discussing does not, of \ncourse, function so well as such a clue as does the one according to which \nDasein's 'Essence' is grounded in its existence.1 If the 'I' is an Essential \ncharacteristic of Dasein, then it is one which must be Interpreted existentially. In \nthat case the \"Who ?\" is to be answered only by exhibiting phenomenally \na definite kind of Being which Dasein possesses. If in each case Dasein is \nits Self only in existing, then the constancy of the Self no less than the \n1 'as such a clue' : here we read 'a Is solcher', following the later editions. The earliest \neditions have 'als solche', which has been corrected in the list of errata. \n\"Essence\": while we ordinarily use 'ess ence' and 'essential' to translate 'Wesen' and \n'wesenhaft', we shall usc ' Essence' and '\u00b7 Essential' (with initial capitals) to translate the \npresumably synonymous but far less frequent 'Essenz' and 'essenticll'. \nThe two 'formal indications' to which Hcideggcr refers are to be found on H. 42 above. \n"

The boat anchored at the shore is assigned in its \nBeing-in-itself to an acquaintance who undertakes voyages with it; but \neven if it is a 'boat which is strange to us', it still is indicative of Others. \nThe Others who are thus 'encountered' in a ready-to-hand, environ\u00ad\nmental context of equipment, are not somehow added on in thought to \nsome Thing which is proximally just present-at-hand; such 'Things' are \nencountered from out of the world in which they are ready-to-hand for \nOthers-a world which is always mine too in advance. In our previous \nanalysis, the range of what is encountered within-the-world was, in the \nfirst instance, narrowed down to equipment ready-to-hand or Nature \npresent-at-hand, and thus to entities with a character other than that of \nDasein. This restriction was necessary not only for the purpose of simpli\u00ad\nfying our explication but above all because the kind ofBeingwhich belongs \nto the Dasein of Others, as we encounter it within-the-world, differs from \nreadiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand. Thus Dasein's world frees \nentities which not only are quite distinct from equipment and Things, but \nwhich also-in accordance with their kind of Being as Dasein themselves\u00ad\nare 'in' the world in which they are at the same time encountered within\u00ad\nthe-world, and are 'in' it by way of Being-in-the-world.1 These entities \nare neither present-at-hand nor ready-to-hand ; on the contrary, they are \nlike the very Dasein which frees them, in that they are there too, and there \nwith it. So if one should want to identify the world in general with \nentities within-the-world, one would have to say that Dasein too is \n'world'.2 \nThus in characterizing the encountering of Others, one is again still \noriented by that Dasein which is in each case one's own. But even in this \ncharacterization does one not start by marking out and isolating the 'I' \nso that one must then seek some way of getting over to the Others from \nthis isolated subject ? To avoid this misunderstanding we must notice in \nwhat sense we are talking about 'the Others'. By 'Others' we do not mean \neveryone else but me-those over against whom the \"I\" stands out. They \nare rather those from whom, for the most part, one does not distinguish \noneself-those among whom one is too. This Being-there-too [Auch-da\u00ad\nsein] with them does not have the ontological character of a Being-present\u00ad\nat-hand-along-'with' them within a world. This 'with' is something of the \ncharacter of Dasein; the 'too' means a sameness of Being as circum\u00ad\nspectively concernf11l Being-in-the-world.

Their Being-in-themselves within-the-world is Dasein-with [Mit\u00ad\ndasein]. \nWhen Others are encountered, it is not the case that one's own subject \nI I 9 \nis proximally present-at-hand and that the rest of the subjects, which are \nlikewise occurrents, get discriminated beforehand and then apprehended ; \nnor are they encountered by a primary act of looking at oneself in such \na way that the opposite pole of a distinction first gets ascertained. They \nare encountered from out of the world, in which concernfully circumspec-\ntive Dasein essentially dwells. Theoretically concocted 'explanations' of \nthe Being-present-at-hand of Others urge themselves upon us all too \neasily ; but over against such explanations we must hold fast to the pheno\u00ad\nmenal facts of the case which we have pointed out, namely, that Others \nare encountered environmentally. This elemental worldly kind of encounter-\ning, which belongs to Dasein and is closest to it, goes so far that even one's \nown Dasein becomes something that it can itself proximally 'come across' \nonly when it looks away from 'Experiences' and the 'centre of its actions', \nor does not as yet 'see' them at all. Dasein finds 'itself' proximally in \nwhat it does, uses, expects, avoids-in those things environmentally ready\u00ad\nto-hand with which it is proximally concerned. \nAnd even when Dasein explicitly addresses itself as \"I here\", this \nlocative personal designation must be understood in terms of Dasein's \nexistential spatiality. In Interpreting this (See Section 23) we have \nalready intimated that this \"1-here\" does not mean a certain privileged \npoint-that of an !-Thing-but is to be understood as Being-in in terms \nof the \"yonder\" of the world that is ready-to-hand-the \"yonder\" which \nis the dwelling-place of Dasein as concern.1 \nW. von Humboldtll has alluded to certain languages which express the \n'I' by 'here', the 'thou' by 'there', the 'he' by 'yonder', thus rendering the \npersonal pronouns by locative adverbs, to put it grammatically. It is con\u00ad\ntroversial whether indeed the primordial signification of locative expres\u00ad\nsions is adverbial or pronominal. But this dispute loses its basis if one \nnotes that locative adverbs have a relationship to the \"I\" qua Dasein. The \n'here' and the 'there' and the 'yonder' are primarily not mere ways of \ndesignating the location of entities present-at-hand within-the-world at \npositions in space ; they are rather characteristics of Dasein's primordial \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n dass dieses Ich-hier nicht einen ausgezeichneten Punkt des Ichdinges meint, \nsondern sich versteht als In-sein aus dem Dort dcr zuhandenen Welt, bei dem Dasein \nals Besorgen sich aufhalt.'

Yet Being-\nI 2 I \nalone 'among' many does not mean that with regard to their Being they \nare merely present-at-hand there alongside us. Even in our Being 'among \nthem' they are there with us; their Dasein-with is encountered in a mode \nin which they are indifferent and alien. Being missing and 'Being away' \n[Das Fehlen und \"Fortsein\"] are modes of Dasein-with, and are possible \nonly because Dasein as Being-with lets the Dasein of Others be en\u00ad\ncountered in its world. Being-with is in every case a characteristic of one's \nown Dasein; Dasein-with characterizes the Dasein of Others to the extent \nthat it is freed by its world for a Being-with.

Concern is a character-of-Being which Being-with \ncannot have as its own, even though Being-with, like concern, is a Being \ntowards entities encountered within-the-world. But those entities towards \nwhich Dasein as Being-with comports itself do not have the kind of Being \nwhich belongs to equipment ready-to-hand ; they are themselves Dasein. \nThese entities are not objects of concern, but rather of solicitude. 4 \n1 Italics supplied in the later editions. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n Mitdasein charakterisiert das Dasein anderer, sofern es fiir ein Mitsein durch \ndessen Welt freigegeben ist.

The more \nliteral 'caring-for' has the connotation of 'being fond of', which we do not want here; \n'personal care' suggests personal hygiene; 'personal concern' suggests one's personal \nbusiness or affairs. 'Fiirsorge' is rather the kind of care which we find in 'prenatal care' or \n'taking care of the children', or even the kind of care which is administered by welfare \nagencies. Indeed the word 'Fiirsorge' is regularly used in contexts where we would speak \nof 'welfare work' or 'social welfare; this is the usage which Heidegger has in mind in his \ndiscussion of 'Fiirsorge' as 'a factical social arrangement'.

For example, 'welfare work' [\"Fi.irsorge\"], as a factical social \narrangement, is grounded in Dasein's state of Being as Being-with. Its \nfactical urgency gets its motivation in that Dasein maintains itself proxi\u00ad\nmally and for the most part in the deficient modes of solicitude. Being for, \nagainst, or without one another, passing one another by, not \"mattering\" \nto one another-these are possible ways of solicitude. And it is precisely \nthese last-named deficient and Indifferent modes that characterize \neveryday, average Being-with-one-another. These modes of Being show \nagain the characteristics of inconspicuousness and obviousness which \nbelong just as much to the everyday Dasein-with of Others within-the\u00ad\nworld as to the readiness-to-hand of the equipment with which one is \ndaily concerned. These Indifferent modes of Being-with-one-another may \neasily mislead ontological Interpretation into interpreting this kind of \nBeing, in the first instance, as the mere Being-present-at-hand of several \nsubjects.

It can, as it were, take away 'care' from the Other and put itself \nin his position in concern : it can leap in for him.1 This kind of solicitude \ntakes over for the Other that with which he is to concern himself. The \nOther is thus thrown out of his own position; he steps back so that after\u00ad\nwards, when the matter has been attended to, he can either take it over as \nsomething finished and at his disposal, 2 or disburden himself of it com\u00ad\npletely. In such solicitude the Other can become one who is dominated \nand dependent, even if this domination is a tacit one and remains hidden \nfrom him. This kind of solicitude, which leaps in and takes away 'care', is \nto a large extent determinative for Being with one another, and pertains \nfor the most part to our concern with the ready-to-hand. \nIn contrast to this, there is also the possibility of a kind of solicitude \nwhich does not so much leap in for the Other as leap ahead of him [ihm \n1 ' \u2022\n.\n.\n si.ch an seine Stelle setzen, fiir ihn einsprin./ten.' Here, as on H. 100 (See our note 2, \np. 133), 1t would be more idiomatic to translate 'fiir ihn einspringen' as 'intervene \nfor him', 'stand in for him' or 'serve as deputy for him' ; but since 'einspringcn' is to be \ncontr\u00fbted with 'vorspringen', 'vorausspringcn' and perhaps even 'entspringen' in the \nfollowm\u00fc paragraphs, we have chosen a translation which suggests the etymological \nconnection. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n urn nachtraglich das Besorgte als fertig Verfiigbares zu iibernehmen \u2022\n.\n.\n ' \n"

This kind of solicitude pertains essentially to authentic care \n-that is, to the existence of the Other, not to a \"what\" with which he is \nconcerned; it helps the Other to become transparent to himself in his care \nand to become free for it. \nSolicitude proves to be a state of Dasein's Being--one which, in \naccordance with its different possibilities, is bound up with its Being \ntowards the world of its concern, and likewise with its authentic Being \ntowards itself. Being with one another is based proximally and often \nexclusively upon what is a matter of common concern in such Being. \nA Being-with-one-another which arises [entspringt] from one's doing the \nsame thing as someone else, not only keeps for the most part within the \nouter limits, but enters the mode of distance and reserve. The Being\u00ad\nwith-one-another of those who are hired for the same affair often thrives \nonly on mistrust. On the other hand, when they devote themselves to the \nsame affair in common, their doing so is determined by the manner in \nwhich their Dasein, each in its own way, has been taken hold of.l They \nthus become authentically bound together, and this makes possible the right \nkind of objectivity [die rechte Sachlichkeit], which frees the Other in his \nfreedom for himself. \nEveryday Being-with-one-another maintains itself between the two \nextremes of positive solicitude-that which leaps in and dominates, and \nthat which leaps forth and liberates [vorspringend-befreienden] . It brings \nnumerous mixed forms to maturity;2 to describe these and classify them \nwould take us beyond the limits of this investigation. \nJust as circumspection belongs to concern as a way of discovering what is \n1 23 \nready-to-hand, solicitude is guided by considerateness and forbearance. 3 \nLike solicitude, these can range through their respective deficient and \nIndifferent modes up to the point of inconsiderateness or the perfunctoriness \nfor which indifference leads the way.4 \n1 'Umgekehrt ist das gemeinsame Sicheinsetzen fiir dieselbe Sache aus dem je eigens \nergriffenen Dasein bestimmt.' \n2 Reading ' . . .  und zeitigt mannigfache Mischformen . .  .' with the older editions.

But Dasein's ownmost meaning of Being is such that this entity \n(which has been freed environmentally) is Being-in in the same world in \nwhich, as encounterable for Others, it is there with them. We have \ninterpreted worldhood as that referential totality which constitutes \nsignificance (Section 18). In Being-familiar with this significance and \npreviously understanding it, Dasein lets what is ready-to-hand be en\u00ad\ncountered as discovered in its involvement. InDasein'sBeing, the context of \nreferences or assignments which significance implies is tied upwithDasein's \nownmost Being-a Being which essentially can have no involvement, \nbut which is rather that Being for the sake of which Dasein itself is as \nit is. \nAccording to the analysis which we have now completed, Being with \nOthers belongs to the Being of Dasein, which is an issue for Dasein in its \nvery Being.1 Thus as Being-with, Dasein 'is' essentially for the sake of \nOthers. This must be understood as an existential statement as to its \nessence. Even if the particular factical Dasein does not turn to Others, and \nsupposes that it has no need of them or manages to get along without \nthem, it is in the way of Being-with. In Being-with, as the existential \"for\u00ad\nthe-sake-of\" of Others, these have already been disclosed in their Dasein. \nWith their Being-with, their disclosedness has been constituted before\u00ad\nhand ; accordingly, this disclosedness also goes to make up significance\u00ad\nthat is to say, worldhood. And, significance, as worldhood, is tied up with \nthe existential \"for-the-sake-of-which\". 2 Since the world hood of that world \nin which every Dasein essentially is already, is thus constituted, it accord\u00ad\ningly lets us encounter what is environmentally ready-to-hand as some\u00ad\nthing with which we are circumspectively concerned, and it does so in \nsuch a way that together with it we encounter the Dasein-with of Others. \nThe structure of the world's worldhood is such that Others are not \nproximally present\u025eat-hand as free-floating subjects along with other \nThings, but show themselves in the world in their special environmental \nBeing, and do so in terms of what is ready-to-hand in that world. \nBeing-with is such that the disclosedness of the Dasein-with of Others \nakin to 'Nachsicht', means to 'inspect' or 'check' something; but it often means to do this \nin a very perfunctory manner, and this latter sense may well be the one which Heidegger \nhas in mind. \n1 ' . \n. \n\u2022 zum Sein des Daseins, urn das es ihm in seinem Sein selbst geht . \u2022 \n.' \nThe older editions have 'darum' instead of'um das'. \nZ 'Diese mit dem Mitscin vorgiingig konstituierte Erschlossenheit der Anderen macht \ndemnach auch die Bedeutsamkeit, d.h. die Weltlichkeit mit aus, als welche sie im \nexistenzialen Worum-willen festgemacht ist.'

It operates proximally in \naccordance with the kind of Being which is closest to us-Being-in-the-\nworld as Being-with ; and it does so by an acquaintance with that which \nDasein, along with the Others, comes across in its environmental circum\u00ad\nspection and concerns itself with-an acquaintance in which Dasein \nunderstands. Solicitous concern is understood in terms of what we are \nconcerned with, and along with our understanding of it. Thus in con\u00ad\ncernful solicitude the Other is proximally disclosed. \nBut because solicitude dwells proximally and for the most part in the \ndeficient or at least the Indifferent modes (in the indifference of passing \none another by), the kind of knowing-oneself which is essential and \nclosest, demands that one become acquainted with oneself. 2 And when, \nindeed, one's knowing-oneself gets lost in such ways as aloofness, hiding \noneself away, or putting on a disguise, Being-with-one-another must \nfollow special routes of its own in order to come close to Others, or even \nto 'see through them' [\"hinter sie\" zu kommen]. \nBut just as opening oneself up [Sichoffenbaren] or closing oneself off is \ngrounded in one's having Being-with-one-another as one's kind of Being \nat the time, and indeed is nothing else but this, even the explicit dis\u00ad\nclosure of the Other in solicitude grows only out of one's primarily Being \nwith him in each case. Such a disclosure of the Other (which is indeed \nthematic, but not in the manner of theoretical psychology) easily becomes \nthe phenomenon which proximally comes to view when one considers the \ntheoretical problematic of understanding the 'psychical life of Others' \n[\"fremden Seelenlebens\"]. In this phenomenally 'proximal' manner it \nthus presents a way of Being with one another understandingly; but at \nthe same time it gets taken as that which, primordially and 'in the \nbeginning', constitutes Being towards Others and makes it possible at all. \n1 'Dieses Verstehen ist, wie Verstehen iiberhaupt, nicht eine aus Erkennen erwachsene \nKenntnis, sondern eine urspriinglich existenziale Seinsart die Erkennen und Kenntnis \nallererst moglich macht'. While we have here translated 'Kenntnis' as 'acquaintance' and \n'Erkennen' as 'knowledge about', these terms must not be understood in the special \nsenses exploited by Lord Russell and C. I. Lewis.

The entity which is 'other' \nhas itself the same kind of Being as Dasein. In Being with and towards \nOthers, there is thus a relationship ofBeing [Seinsverhaltnis) from Dasein \nto Dasein. But it might be said that this relationship is already constitutive \nfor one's own Dasein, which, in its own right, has an understanding of \nBeing, and which thus relates itselfl towards Dasein. The relationship-of\u00ad\nBeing which one has towards Others would then become a Projection2 \nof one's own Being-towards-oneself 'into something else'. The Other \nwould be a duplicate of the Self. \nBut while these deliberations seem obvious enough, it is easy to see that \nthey have little ground to stand on. The presupposition which this argu\u00ad\nment demands-that Dasein's Being towards an Other is its Being towards \nitself-fails to hold. As long as the legitimacy of this presupposition has not \nturned out to be evident, one may still be puzzled as to how Dasein's \nrelationship to itself is thus to be disclosed to the Other as Other. \nNot only is Being towards Others an autonomous, irreducible relation\u00ad\nship of Being: this relationship, as Being-with, is one which, with Dasein's \nBeing, already is. 3 Of course it is indisputable that a lively mutual \nacquaintanceship on the basis of Being-with, often depends upon how far \none's own Dasein has understood itself at the time ; but this means that it \ndepends only upon how far one's essential Being with Others has made \nitself transparent and has not disguised itself. 4 And that is possible only if \nDasein, as Being-in-the-world, already is with Others. 'Empathy' does not \nfirst constitute Being-with; only on the basis of Being-with does 'empathy' \nbecome possible : it gets its motivation from the unsociability of the \ndominant modes of Being-with. 5 \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n sich . . .  verhalt . .  .' We have often translated this expression as 'comports' \nitself', compromising between two other possible meanings : 'relates itself' and 'behaves \nor 'conducts itself'. In this pasage, however, and in many others where this expression is \ntied up with 'Verhaltnis' ('relationship') rather than with 'Verhalten' ('behaviour or \n'conduct'), only 'relates itself' seems appropriate. \n2 'Projektion'. Here we are dealing with 'projection' in the familiar psychological sense, \nnot in the sense which would be expressed by 'Entwurf'. See H. 145 ff. \n3 'Das Sein zu Anderen ist nicht nur ein eigenstandiger, irreduktibler Seinsbezug, er \nist als Mitsein mit dem Sein des Daseins schon seiend.' \n\u009b ' . . .  wie weit es das wesenhafte Mitsein mit anderen sich durchsichtig gemacht \nund nicht verstellt hat . . .  ' (The older editions have ' . . .  sich nicht undurchsichtig \ngemacht und verstellt hat . .  .'.) \n6 ' \"Einfli.hlung\" konstituiert nicht erst das Mitsein, sondem ist auf dessen Grunde \nerst moglich und durch die vorherschenden defizienten Modi des Mitseins in ihrer \nUnumganglichkeit motiviert.' \n"

Dasein-with has proved to be a kind of \nBeing \nwhich \nentities \nencountered \nwithin-the-world \nhave \nas \ntheir \nown.

There 'here' of an \n'1-here' is always understood in relation to a 'yonder' ready-to-hand, in \nthe sense of a Being towards this 'yonder'-a Being which is de-severant, \ndirectional, and concernful. Dasein's existential spatiality, which thus \ndetermines its 'location', is itself grounded in Being-in-the-world. The \n\"yonder\" belongs definitely to something encountered within-the-world. \n'Here' and 'yonder' are possible only in a 'there'-that is to say, only if \nthere is an entity which has made a disclosure of spatiality as the Being of \nthe 'there'. This entity carries in its ownmost Being the character of not \nbeing closed off. In the expression 'there' we have in view this essential \ndisclosedness. By reason of this disclosedness, this entity (Dasein), together \nwith the Being-there1 of the world, is 'there' for itself. \nWhen we talk in an ontically figurative way of the lumen naturale in \n133 \nman, we have in mind nothing other than the existential-ontological \nstructure of this entity, that it is in such a way as to be its \"there\". To say \nthat it is 'illuminated' [\"erleuchtet\"] means that as Being-in-the-world \nit is cleared [gelichtet] in itself, not through any other entity, but in such \na way that it is itself the clearing. 2 Only for an entity which is existentially \ncleared in this way does that which is present-at-hand become accessible in \nthe light or hidden in the dark.

Dasein is its disclosedness. \nWe are to set forth the Constitution of this Being. But in so far as the \nessence of this entity is existence, the existential proposition, 'Dasein is its \ndisclosedness', means at the same time that the Being which is an issue for \nthis entity in its very Being is to be its 'there'. In addition to characterizing \nthe primary Constitution of the Being of disclosedness, we will require, in \nconformity with the course of the analysis, an Interpretation of the kind \nof Being in which this entity is its \"there\" in an everyday manner. \nThis chapter, in which we shall undertake the explication of Being-in as \nsuch (that is to say, of the Being of the \"there\"), breaks up into two parts : \nA. the existential Constitution of the \"there\" ; B. the everyday Being of the \n\"there\", and the falling of Dasein. \nIn understanding and state-of-mind, we shall see the two constitutive ways \n1 'Da-sein'. See our note 1, p. 27, H. 7 above. \n2 'Lichtung'. This word is customarily used to stand for a 'clearing' in the woods, not \nfor a 'clarification' ;  the verb 'lichten' is similarly used.

In the evasion itself the \"there\" \nis something disclosed. \nThis characteristic of Dasein's Being-this 'that it is'-is veiled in its \n\"whence\" and \"whither\", yet disclosed in itself all the more unveiledly; \nwe call it the \"thrownness\" 1 of this entity into its \"there''; indeed, it is \nthrown in such a way that, as Being-in-the-world, it is the \"there\". The \nexpression \"thrownness\" is meant to suggest the facticity of its being \ndelivered over. 2 The 'that it is and has to be' which is disclosed in Dasein's \nstate-of-mind is not the same 'that-it-is' which expresses ontologico\u00ad\ncategorially the factuality belonging to presence-at-hand. This factuality \nbecomes accessible only if we ascertain it by looking at it. The \"that-it-is\" \nwhich is disclosed in Dasein's state-of-mind must rather be conceived as \nan existential attribute of the entity which has Being-in-the-world as its \nway of Being. Facticity is not the factuality of the factum brutum of some\u00ad\nthing present-at-hand, but a characteristic of Dasein' s Being-one which has been \ntaken up into existence, even if proximally it has been thrust aside. The \"that-it-is\" \nof facticity never becomes something that we can come across by behold\u00ad\ning it. \nAn entity of the character of Dasein is its \"there\" in such a way that, \nwhether explicitly or not, it finds itself [sich befindet] in its thrownness. \nIn a state-of-mind Dasein is always brought before itself, and has . \nalways found itself, not in the sense of coming across itself by perceiving \nitself, but in the sense of finding itself in the mood that it has. 3 & an entity \nwhich has been delivered over to its Being, it remains also delivered over \nto the fact that it must always have found itself-but found itself in a \nway of finding which arises not so much from a direct seeking as rather \nfrom a fleeing. The way in which the mood discloses is not one in which \nwe look at thrownness, but one in which we turn towards or turn away \n[An- und Abkehr]. For the most part the mood does not turn towards \nthe burdensome character of Dasein which is manifest in it, and least of all \ndoes it do so in the mood of elation when this burden has been alleviated. \nIt is always by way of a state-of-mind that this turning-away is what it is. \n1 'Gewo\u02b9fenheit'. This important term, which Heidegger introduces here, is further \ndiscussed in Section 38. \n2 'Der Ausdruck Geworfenheit soil die Faktizitiit der Oberantwortung andeuten.' On the \ndistinction between 'facticity' and 'factuality', see H. 56 above. \n3 In this sentence there is a contrast between 'wahrnehmendes Sich-vorfinden' ('coming \nacross itself by perceiving') and 'gestimmtes Sichbefinden' ('finding itself in the mood \nthat it has'). In the next sentence, on the other hand, 'found' and 'finding' represent \n'gefunden' and 'Finden'. \n"

Even if Dasein is 'assured' in its \n1 36\nbelief about its 'whither', or if, in rational enlightenment, it supposes \nitself to know about its \"whence\", all this counts for nothing as against \nthe phenomenal facts of the case : for the mood brings Dasein before the \n\"that-it-is\" of its \"there\", which, as such, stares it in the face with the \ninexorability of an enigma.1 From the existential-ontological point of view, \nthere is not the slightest justification for minimizing what is 'evident' in \nstates-of-mind, by measuring it against the apodictic certainty of a theo\u00ad\nretical cognition of something which is purely present-at-hand. However \nthe phenomena are no less falsified when they are banished to the sanc-\ntuary of the irrational. When irrationalism, as the counterplay of ration-\nalism, talks about the things to which ration11lism is blind, it does so only \nwith a squint. \n\u00b7 \nFactically, Dasein can, should, and must, through knowledge and will, \nbecome master of its moods ; in certain possible ways of existing, this may \nsignify a priority of volition and cognition. Only we must not be misled \nby this into denying that ontologically mood is a primordial kind of Being \nfor Dasein, in which Dasein is disclosed to itself prior to all cognition and \nvolition, and beyond their range of disclosure. And furthermore, when we \nmaster a mood, we do so by way of a counter-mood ; we are never free \nof moods. Ontologically, we thus obtain as the .first essential characteristic \nof states-of-mind that they disclose Dasein in its thrownness, and-proximally and \nfor the most part-in the manner of an evasive turning-away. \nFrom what has been said we can see already that a state-of-mind is \nvery remote from anything like coming across a psychical condition by \nthe kind of apprehending which first turns round and then back. Indeed \nit is so far from this, that only because the \"there\" has already been dis\u00ad\nclosed in a state-of-mind can immanent reflection come across 'Experiences' \nat all. The 'bare mood' discloses the \"there\" more primordially, but corre\u00ad\nspondingly it closes it off more stubbornly than any not-perceiving. \nThis is shown by bad moods. In these, Dasein becomes blind to itself, \nthe environment with which it is concerned veils itself, the circumspection \nof concern gets led astray. States-of-mind are so far from being reflected \nupon, that precisely what they do is to assail Dasein in its unreflecting \ndevotion to the 'world' with which it is concerned and on which it expends \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n so verschliigt das alles nichts gegen den phiinomenalen Tatbestand, dass die \nStimmung das Dasein vor das Dass seines Da bringt, als welches es ihm in unerbittlicher \nRiitselhaftigkeit entgegenstarrt.'

It is not an accident that \nthe earliest systematic Interpretation of affects that has come down to us \nis not treated in the framework of 'psychology'. Aristotle investigates the \n'TaOTJ (affects] in the second book of his Rhetoric. Contrary to the tradi\u00ad\ntional orientation, according to which rhetoric is conceived as the kind of \nthing we 'learn in school', this work of Aristotle must be taken as the first \nsystematic hermeneutic of the everydayness of Being with one another. \nPublicness, as the kind of Being which belongs to the \"they\" (Cf. Section \n27), not only has in general its own way of having a mood, but needs \nmoods and 'makes' them for itself. It is into such a mood and out of such \n1 39 \na mood that the orator speaks. He must understand the possibilities of \nmoods in order to rouse them and guide them aright. \nHow the Interpretation of the affects was carried further in the Stoa, \nand how it was handed down to modem times through patristic and \nscholastic theology, is well known. What has escaped notice is that the \nbasic ontological Interpretation of the affective life in general has been able \nto make scarcely one forward step worthy of mention since Aristotle. On \nthe contrary, affects and feelings come under the theme of psychical \nphenomena, functioning as a third class of these, usually along with idea\u00ad\ntion [Vorstellen] and volition. They sink to the level of accompanying \nphenomena. \nIt has been one of the merits of phenomenological research that it has \nagain brought these phenomena more unrestrictedly into our sight. Not \nonly that: Scheler, accepting the challenges of Augustine and Pascal,v \nhas guided the problematic to a consideration of how acts which 'repre\u00ad\nsent' and acts which 'take an interest' are interconnected in their founda\u00ad\ntions. But even here the existential-ontological foundations of the \nphenomenon of the act in general are admittedly still obscure. \nA state-of-mind not only discloses Dasein in its thrownness and its \nsubmission to that world which is already disclosed with its own Being ; \nit is itself the existential kind of Being in which Dasein constantly sur\u00ad\nrenders itself to the 'world' and lets the 'world' \"matter\" to it in such a \nway that somehow Dasein evades its very self. The existential constitution \nof such evasion will become clear in the phenomenon of falling. \nA state-of-mind is a basic existential way in which Dasein is its \"there\". \nIt not only characterizes Dasein ontologically, but, because of what it \ndiscloses, it is at the same time methodologically significant in principle \n"

On \nthe other hand, 'understanding' in the sense of one possible kind of cog\u00ad\nnizing among others (as distinguished, for instance, from 'explaining'), \nmust, like explaining, be Interpreted as an existential derivative of that \nprimary understanding which is one of the constituents of the Being of \nthe \"there\" in general. \nWe have, after all, already come up against this primordial under\u00ad\nstanding in our previous investigations, though we did not allow it to be \nincluded explicitly in the theme under discussion. To say that in existing, \nDasein is its \"there\", is equivalent to saying that the world is 'there' ; its \nBeing-there is Being-in. And the latter is likewise 'there', as that for the sake \nof which Dasein is. In the \"for-the-sake-of-which\", existing Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld is disclosed as such, and this disclosedness we have called \"under\u00ad\nstanding\".vii In the understanding of the \"for-the-sake-of-which\", the \nsignificance which is grounded therein, is disclosed along with it. The \ndisclosedness of understanding, as the disclosedness of the \"for-the-sake\u00ad\nof-which\" and of significance equiprimordially, pertains to the entirety of \nBeing-in-the-world. Significance is that on the basis of which the world is \ndisclosed as such. To say that the \"for-the-sake-of-which\" and significance \nare both disclosed in Dasein, means that Dasein is that entity which, as \nBeing-in-the-world, is an issue for itself. \n1 ' \u2022\n.\n.\n im ontischen Sinne einer faktischen, \"vereinzelten\" Veranlagung . . .' While the \nverb 'vereinzeln' often means 'to isolate', Heidegger does not ordinarily use it in this \nsense. Indeed he contrasts it with the verb 'isolieren'. Cf. H. 188 below. \n"

The kind of Being which \nDasein has, as potentiality-for-Being, lies existentially in understanding. \nDasein is not something present-at-hand which possesses its competence \nfor something by way of an extra; it is primarily Being-possible. Dasein is \nin every case what it can be, and in the way in which it is its possibility. \nThe Being-possible which is essential for Dasein, pertains to the ways of \nits solicitude for Others and of its concern with the 'world', as we have \ncharacterized them; and in all these, and always, it pertains to Dasein's \npotentiality-for-Being towards itself, for the sake of itself. The Being\u00ad\npossible which Dasein is existentially in every case, is to be sharply \ndistinguished both from empty logical possibility and from the contingency \nof something present-at-hand, so far as with the present-at-hand this or \nthat can 'come to pass'.2 As a modal category of presence-at-hand, \npossibility signifies what is not yet actual and what is not at any time necessary. \nIt characterizes the merely possible. Ontologically it is on a lower level than \nactuality and necessity. On the other hand, possibility as an existentiale is \nthe most primordial and ultimate positive way in which Dasein is \n144 \ncharacterized ontologically. As with existentiality in general, we can, in \nthe first instance, only prepare for the problem of possibility. The phenom-\nenal basis for seeing it at all is provided by the understanding as a dis\u00ad\nclosive potentiality-for-Being. \nPossibility, as an existentiale, does not signify a free-floating potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being in the sense of the 'liberty of indifference' (libertas indiferentiae). \nIn every case Dasein, as essentially having a state-of-mind, has already \ngot itself into definite possibilities. As the potentiality-for-Being which is \nis, it has let such possibilities pass by; it is constantly waiving the pos\u00ad\nsibilities of its Being, or else it seizes upon them and makes mistakes. 3 But \nthis means that Dasein is Being-possible which has been delivered over to \nitself-thrown possibility through and through. Dasein is the possibility of \nBeing-free for its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. Its Being-possible is \ntransparent to itself in different possible ways and degrees. \nUnderstanding . is the Being of such potentiality-for-Being, which is \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n in der Bedeutung von \"einer Sache \n,\nvo;stehen kiin?e\u0227\", \"ih; gewach\u0228en. sein\", \n\"etwas kiinnen\" .'

The char\u00ad\nacter of understanding as projection is constitutive for Being-in-the-world \nwith regard to the disclosedness of its existentially constitutive state-of\u00ad\nBeing by which the factical potentiality-for-Being gets its leeway \n[Spielraum] . And as thrown, Dasein is thrown into the kind of Being \nwhich we call \"projecting\". Projecting has nothing to do with comporting \noneself towards a plan that has been thought out, and in accordance with \nwhich Dasein arranges its Being. On the contrary, any Dasein has, as \nDasein, already projected itself; and as long as it is, it is projecting. As \nlong as it is, Dasein always has understood itself and always will under\u00ad\nstand itself in terms of possibilities. Furthermore, the character of under\u00ad\nstanding as projection is such that the understanding does not grasp \nthematically that upon which it projects-that is to say, possibilities. \nGrasping it in such a manner would take away from what is projected its \nvery character as a possibility, and would reduce it to the given contents \nwhich we have in mind ; whereas projection, in throwing, throws before \nitself the possibility as possibility, and lets it be as such. 2 As projecting, \nunderstanding is the kind of Being of Dasein in which it is its possibilities \nas possibilities. \nBecause of the kind of Being which is constituted by the existentiale of \nprojection, Dasein is constantly 'more' than it factually is, supposing that \none might want to make an inventory of it as something-at-hand and list \nthe contents of its Being, and supposing that one were able to do so. But \nDasein is never more than it factically is, for to its facticity its potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being belongs essentially. Yet as Being-possible, moreover, Dasein is \nnever anything less ; that is to say, it is existentially that which, in its \n1 'Entwurf'. The basic meaning of this noun and the cognate verb 'entwerfen' is that of \n'throwing' something 'off' or 'away' from one; but in ordinary German usage, and often \nin Heidegger, they take on the sense of'designing' or 'sketching' some 'project' which is to \nbe carried through ; and they may also be used in the more special sense of'projection' in \nwhich a geometer is said to 'project' a curve 'upon' a plane. The words 'projection' and \n'project' accordingly lend themselves rather well to translating these words in many \ncontexts, especially since their root meanings are very similar to those of 'Entwurf' and \n'entwerfen' ;  but while the root meaning of 'throwing- off' is still very much alive in \nHeidegger's German, it has almost entirely died out in the ordinary English usage of \n'projection' and 'project', which in turn have taken on some connotations not felt in the \nGerman. Thus when in the English translation Dasein is said to 'project' entities, or \npossibilities, or even its own Being 'upon' something, the reader should bear in mind \nthat the root meaning of 'throwing' is more strongly felt in the German than in the \ntranslation. \ns \u2022  \n\u2022\n\u2022\n.\n zieht es herab zu einem gegebenen, gemeinten Bestand, wahrend der Entwurfim \nWerfen die Miiglichkeit als Miiglichkeit sich vorwirft und als solche sein !asst.' The expres\u00ad\nsion 'einem etwas vorwerfen' means literally to 'throw something forward to someone', \nbut often has the connotation of 'reproaching him with something', or 'throwing some\u00ad\nthing in his teeth'. Heidegger may have more than one of these significations in mind. \n"

Understanding can devote itself primarily to the dis\u00ad\nclosedness of the world; that is, Dasein can, proximally and for the most \npart, understand itself in terms of its world. Or else understanding throws \nitself primarily into the \"for-the-sake-of-which\" ; that is, Dasein exists as \nitself. Understanding is either authentic, arising out of one's own Self as \nsuch, or inauthentic. The 'in-' of \"inauthentic\" does not mean that \nDasein cuts itself off from its Self and understands 'only' the world. The \nworld belongs to Being-one's-Self as Being-in-the-world. On the other \nhand, authentic understanding, no less than that which is inauthentic, \ncan be either genuine or not genuine. As potentiality-for-Being, under\u00ad\nstanding is altogether permeated with possibility. When one is diverted \ninto [Sichverlegen in] one of these basic possibilities of understanding, the \nother is not laid aside [legt . . .  nicht ab]. Because understanding, in every case, \npertains rather to Dasein' s full disclosedness as Being-in-the-world, this diversion \nof the understanding is an existential modification of projection as a whole. In under\u00ad\nstanding the world, Being-in is always understood along with it, while \nunderstanding of existence as such is always an understanding of the world. \nAs factical Dasein, any Dasein has already diverted its potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing into a possibility of understanding. \nIn its projective character, understanding goes to make up existentially \nwhat we call Dasein's \"sight\" [Sicht] . With the disclosedness of the \"there\", \nthis sight is existentially [existenzial seiende] ; and Dasein is this sight \nequiprimordially in each of those basic ways of its Being which we have \nalready noted : as the circumspection [Umsicht] of concern, as the con\u00ad\nsiderateness [Rucksicht] of solicitude, and as that sight which is directed \nupon Being as such [Sicht auf das Sein als solches], for the sake of which \nany Dasein is as it is. The sight which is related primarily and on the whole \nto existence we call \"transparency\" [Durchsichtigkeit]. We choose this term \nto designate 'knowledge of the Self'1 in a sense which is well understood, \n1 '  \"Selbsterkenntnis\" '. This should be carefully distinguished from the 'Sichkennen' \ndiscussed on H. 124\u00b71 25. Perhaps this distinction can be expresed-though rather crudely \n-by pointing out that we are here concerned with a full and sophisticated knowledge of \nthe Self in all its implications, while in the earlier passage we were concerned with the \nkind of 'self-knowledge' which one loses when one 'forgets oneself' or does something so \nout of character that one 'no longer knows oneself'. \n"

In existing, \nentities sight 'themselves' [sichtet \"sich\"] only in so far as they have \nbecome transparent to themselves with equal primordiality in those items \nwhich are constitutive for their existence : their Being-alongside the \nworld and their Being-with Others. \nOn the other hand, Dasein's opaqueness [Undurchsichtigkeit] is not \nrooted primarily and solely in 'egocentric' self-deceptions ; it is rooted just \nas much in lack of acquaintance with the world. \nWe must, to be sure, guard against a misunderstanding of the expression \n147 \n'sight'.

'Intuition' and 'thinking' are both derivatives of understanding, \nand already rather remote ones. Even the phenomenological 'intuition of \nessences' [\"Wesensschau\"] is grounded in existential understanding.

The ready-to-hand \ncomes explicitly into the sight which understands. Al preparing, putting to \nrights, repairing, improving, rounding-out, are accomplished in the \nfollowing way : we take apart2 in its \"in-order-to\" that which is circum-\n149 \nspectively ready-to-hand, and we concern ourselves with it in accordance \nwith what becomes visible through this process. That which has been \ncircumspectively taken apart with regard to its \"in-order-to\", and taken \napart as such-that which is explicitly understood-has the structure of \nsomething as something.

That which is disclosed in understanding-\nthat which is understood-is already accessible in such a way that its 'as \nwhich' can be made to stand out explicitly. The 'as' makes up the struc-\nture of the explicitness of something that is understood. It constitutes the \ninterpretation. In dealing with what is environmentally ready-to-hand \nby interpreting it circumspectively, we 'see' it as a table, a door, a car-\nriage, or a bridge ; but what we have thus interpreted [Ausgelegte] need \nnot necessarily be also taken apart [auseinander zu legen] by making an \nassertion which definitely characterizes it. Any mere pre-predicative seeing \nof the ready-to-hand is, in itself, something which already understands \nand interprets. But does not the absence of such an 'as' make up the \nmereness of any pure perception of something? Whenever we see with this \nkind of sight, we already do so understandingly and interpretatively. In \nthe mere encountering of something, it is understood in terms of a totality \nof involvements ; and such seeing hides in itself the explicitness of the \nassignment-relations (of the \"in-order-to\") which belong to that totality. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n gibt sich \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n zu verstehen, welche Bewandtnis es je mit dem Begegnenden haben \nkann.' \n2 'auseinandergelegt'.

In such an assertion the 'as' does not \nturn up for the first time ; it just gets expressed for the first time, and this \nis possible only in that it lies before us as something expressible.1 The fact \nthat when we look at something, the explicitness of assertion can be absent, \ndoes not justify our denying that there is any Articulative interpretation \nin such mere seeing, and hence that there is any as-structure in it. When \nwe have to do with anything, the mere seeing of the Things which are \nclosest to us bears in itself the structure of interpretation, and in so primor\u00ad\ndial a manner that just to grasp something free, as it were, of the \"as\", \nrequires a certain readjustment. When we merely stare at something, our \njust-having-it-before-us lies before us as a failure to understand it any more. \nThis grasping which is free of the \"as\", is a privation ofthe kind of seeing \nin which one merelJ understands. It is not more primordial than that kind \nof seeing, but is derived from it. If the 'as' is ontically unexpressed, this \nmust not seduce us into overlooking it as a constitutive state for under\u00ad\nstanding, existential and a priori. \nBut if we never perceive equipment that is ready-to-hand without \nalready understanding and interpreting it, and if such perception lets us \nI 50 \ncircumspectively encounter something as something, does this not mean \nthat in the first instance we have experienced something purely present\u00ad\nat-hand, and then taken it as a door, as a house ? This would be a \nmisunderstanding of the specific way in which interpretation functions as \ndisclosure. In interpreting, we do not, so to speak, throw a 'signification' \nover some naked thing which is present-at-hand, we do not stick a value \non it; but when something within-the-world is encountered as such, the \n1 ' \u2022\n.\n.\n was allein so moglich ist, dass es als Aussprechbares vor-Iiegt.' Here we follow the \nreading of the earlier editions. The hyphen in 'vor-liegt' comes at the end of the line in the \nlater editions, but is undoubtedly meant to suggest (like the italicization of the 'vor' in \nthe previous sentence) that this verb is to be interpreted with unusual literalness. \nThis paragraph is noteworthy for an exploitation of the prefix 'aus' ('out'), which fails \nto \u01a4how up in our translation. Literally an 'Aussage' ('assertion') is something which is \n'srud out' ; an 'Auslegung' ('interpretation'} is a 'laying-out' ; that which is 'ausdriicklich' \n('explicit') is something that has been 'pressed out' ; that which is 'aussprechbar' (our \n'expressible') is something that can be 'spoken out'. \nThe verbs 'ausdriicken' and 'aussprechen' are roughly synonymous; but 'aussprechen' \noften has the more specific connotations of 'pronunciation', 'pronouncing oneself', 'speak\u00ad\ning one's mind', 'finishing what one has to say', etc. While it would be possible to reserve \n'express' for 'ausdricken' and translate 'aussprechen' by some such phrase as 'speak out', \nit is more convenient to use 'express' for both verbs, especially since 'aussprechen' and its \nderivatives have occurred very seldom before the present chapter, in which 'ausdriicken' \nrarely appears. On the other hand, we can easily distinguish between the more frequent \n'ausdriicklich' and 'ausgesprochen' by translating the latter as 'expressed' or 'expressly', \nand reserving 'explicit' for both 'ausdriicklich' and 'explizit'. \n"

The character of the possibility corresponds, on each occasion, \nwith the kind of Being of the entity which is understood. Entities within\u00ad\nthe-world generally are projected upon the world-that is, upon a whole \nof significance, to whose reference-relations concern, as Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, has been tied up in advance. When entities within-the-world are \ndiscovered along with the Being ofDasein-that is, when they have come \nto be understood-we say that they have meaning [Sinn]. But that which \nis understood, taken strictly is not the meaning but the entity, or \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n eines Vorgegebenen.' Here, as in many other passages, we have translated \n'vorgeben' by various forms of the verb 'to present' ; but it would perhaps be more in line \nwith Heidegger's discussion of the prefix 'vor-' to write ' . . .  of something fore-given'. \n"

That which can be Articulated in a \ndisclosure by which we understand, we call \"meaning\". The concept of \nmeaning embraces the formal existential framework of what necessarily \nbelongs to that which an understanding interpretation Articulates. \nMeaning is the \"upon-which\" of a projection in terms of which something becomes \nintelligible as something; it gets its structure from a fore-having, a fore-sight, and \na fore-conception.1 In so far as understanding and interpretation make up \nthe existential state of Being of the \"there\", \"meaning\" must be conceived \nas the formal-existential framework of the disclosedness which belongs to \nunderstanding. Meaning is an existentiale of Dasein, not a property \nattaching to entities, lying 'behind' them, or floating somewhere as an \n'intermediate domain'. Dasein only 'has' meaning, so far as the \ndisclosedness of Being-in-the-world can be 'filled in' by the entities dis\u00ad\n\u0207overable in that disclosedness. 2 Hence only Dasein can be meaningful [sinn\u00ad\nJOlt] or meaningless [sinnlos]. That is to say, its own Being and the entities \n:lisclosed with its Being can be appropriated in understanding, or can \n:emain relegated to non-understanding. \nThis Interpretation of the concept of 'meaning' is one which is onto-\n152 \ntogico-cxistential in principle; if we adhere to it, then all entities whose \nkind of Being is of a character other than Dasein's must be conceived as \nunmeaning [unsinniges], essentially devoid of any meaning at all. Here \n'unmeaning' does not signify that we are saying anything about the \nvalue of such entities, but it gives expression to an ontological \ncharacteristic. And only that which is unmeaning can be absurd [ widersinnig]. \nThe present-at-hand, as Dasein encounters it, can, as it were, assault \nDasein's Being; natural events, for instance, can break in upon us and \ndestroy us. \nAnd if we are inquiring about the meaning of Being, our investigation \ndoes not then become a \"deep\" one [tiefsinnig], nor does it puzzle out \nwhat stands behind Being. It asks about Being itself in so far as Being \nenters into the intelligibility ofDasein. The meaning of Being can never be \n1 'Sinn ist das durch Vorhabe, Vorsicht und Vorgijf strukturierte Woraufhin des Entwurjs, aus \ndem her etwas als etwas verstiindlich wird.' (Notice that our usual translation of 'verstandlich, \nand 'Verstandlichkeit' as 'intelligible' and 'intelligibility', fails to show the connection of \nthe words with 'Verstandnis', etc. This connection could have been brought out \neffectively by writing 'understandable,' 'understandability', etc., but only at the cost of \nawkwardness.) \n2 'Sinn \"hat\" nur das Dasein, sofern die Erschlossenheit des In-der-Welt-seins durch \ndas in ihr entdeckbare Seiende \"erftillbar\" ist.' The point of this puzzling and ambiguous \nsentence may become somewhat clearer if the reader recalls that here as elsewhere (see \nH. 75 above) the verb 'erschliessen' ('disclose') is used in the sense of 'opening something \n!JP' so that its contents can be 'discovered'. What thus gets 'opened up' will then be 'filled \nIn' as more and more of its contents get discovered. \nG \n"

In every understanding of the world, \nexistence is understood with it, and vice versa. All interpretation, moreover, \noperates in the fore-structure, which we have already characterized. Any \ninterpretation which is to contribute understanding, must already have \nunderstood what is to be interpreted. This is a fact that has always been \nremarked, even if only in the area of derivative ways of understanding and \ninterpretation, such as philological Interpretation. The latter belongs \nwithin the range of scientific knowledge. Such knowledge demands the \nrigour of a demonstration to provide grounds for it. In a scientific proof, \nwe may not presuppose what it is our task to provide grounds for. But if \ninterpretation must in any case already operate in that which is under\u00ad\nstood, and if it must draw its nurture from this, how is it to bring any \nscientific results to maturity without moving in a circle, especially if, \nmoreover, the understanding which is presupposed still operates within \nour common information about man and the world ?

Historiology is permitted \nto compensate for this defect to some extent through the 'spiritual sig\u00ad\nnification' of its 'objects'. But even in the opinion of the historian himself, \nit would admittedly be more ideal if the circle could be avoided and if \nthere remained the hope of creating some time a historiology which would \nbe as independent of the standpoint of the observer as our knowledge of \nNature is supposed to be. \n153 \nBut if we see this circle as a vicious one and look out for ways of avoiding it, even if \nwe just 'sense' it as an inevitable imperfection, then the act of understanding \nhas been misunderstood from the ground up. The assimilation of understanding \nand interpretation to a definite ideal of knowledge is not the issue here. \nSuch an ideal is itself only a subspecies of understanding-a subspecies \nwhich has strayed into the legitimate task of grasping the present-at\u00ad\nhand in its essential unintelligibility [Unverstandlichkeit].

In the circle is hidden a positive possibility of \nthe most primordial kind of knowing. To be sure, we genuinely take hold \nof this possibility only when, in our interpretation, we have understood \nthat our first, last, and constant task is never to allow our fore-having, \nfore-sight, and fore-conception to be presented to us by fancies and \npopular conceptions, but rather to make the scientific theme secure by \nworking out these fore-structures in terms of the things themselves. \nBecause understanding, in accordance with its existential meaning, is \nDasein's own potentiality-for-Being, the oliltological presuppositions of \nhistoriological knowledge transcend in principle the idea of rigour held \nin the most exact sciences. Mathematics is not more rigorous than his\u00ad\ntoriology, but only narrower, because the existential foundations relevant \nfor it lie within a narrower range. \nThe 'circle' in understanding belongs to the structure of meaning, and \nthe latter phenomenon is rooted in the existential constitution ofDasein\u00ad\nthat is, in the understanding which interprets.

It remains to ask with what justification we have \ntaken assertion as a mode of interpretation at all. If it is something of \nthis sort, then the essential structures of interpretation must recur in it. \nThe pointing-out which assertion does is performed on the basis of what \nhas already been disclosed in understanding or discovered circumspec\u00ad\ntively. Assertion is not a free-floating kind of behaviour which, in its own \nright, might be capable of disclosing entities in general in a primary way : \non the contrary it always maintains itself on the basis of Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld. What we have shown earlierlx in relation to knowing the world, \nholds just as well as assertion.

To any assertion as a communication which gives something \na definite character there belongs, moreover, an Articulation of what is \npointed out, and this Articulation is in accordance with significations. \nSuch an assertion will operate with a definite way of conceiving : \"The \nhammer is heavy\", \"Heaviness belongs to the hammer\", \"The hammer \nhas the property of heaviness\". When an assertion is made, some fore\u00ad\nconception is always implied ; but it remains for the most part incon\u00ad\nspicuous, because the language already hides in itself a developed way \nof conceiving.

Prior to all \nanalysis, logic has already understood 'logically' what it takes as a theme \nunder the heading of the \"categorical statement\"-for instance, 'The \nhammer is heavy'. The unexplained presupposition is that the 'meaning' \nof this sentence is to be taken as: \"This Thing-a hammer-has the \nproperty of heaviness\". In concernful circumspection there are no such \nassertions 'at first'. But such circumspection has of course its specific ways \nof interpreting, and these, as .compared with the 'theoretical judgment' \njust mentioned, may take some such form as 'The hammer is too heavy', \nor rather just 'Too heavy !', 'Hand me the other hammer !' Interpretation \nis carried out primordially not in a theoretical statement but in an action \nof circumspective concern-laying aside the unsuitable tool, or exchanging \nit, 'without wasting words'. From the fact that words are absent, it may \nnot be concluded that interpretation is absent.

The ..\\oyos gets experienced as \nsomething present-at-hand and Interpreted as such, while at the same \ntime the entities which it points out have the meaning of presence-at\u00ad\nhand. This meaning of Being is left undifferentiated and uncontrasted \nwith other possibilities of Being, so that Being in the sense of a formal \nBeing-something becomes fused with it simultaneously, and we are unable \neven to obtain a clear-cut division between these two realms. \n1f 34\u00b7 Being-there and Discourse. Language \nThe fundamental existentialia which constitute the Being of the \"there\", \nthe disclosedness of Being-in-the-world, are states-of-mind and under\u00ad\nstanding. In understanding, there lurks the possibility of interpretation-\nthat is, of appropriating what is understood. In so far as a state-of-mind \nis equiprimordial with an act of understanding, it maintains itself in a \ncertain understanding. Thus there corresponds to it a certain capacity \nfor getting interpreted. We have seen that assertion is derived from \ninterpretation, and is an extreme case of it. In clarifying the third significa-\ntion of assertion as communication (speaking forth), we were led to the \nconcepts of \"saying\" and \"speaking\", to which we had purposely given \nno attention up to that point. The fact that language now becomes our \ntheme for the first time will indicate that this phenomenon has its roots in \nthe existential constitution of Dasein's disclosedness. The existential\u00ad\nontological foundation of language is discourse or talk.1 This phenomenon is \n161 \none of which we have been making constant use already in our foregoing \nInterpretation of state-of-mind, understanding, interpretation, and asser-\ntion; but we have, as it were, kept it suppressed in our thematic analysis. \nDiscourse is existentially equiprimordial with state-of-mind and understanding. \nThe intelligibility of something has always been articulated, even before \nthere is any appropriative interpretation of it. Discourse is the Articulation \n1 '&de'. As we have pointed out earlier (see our note 3, p. 47, H. 25 above) , we have \n\u0229anslated this word either as 'discourse' or 'talk', as the context seems to demand, some\u00ad\ntimes compromising with the hendiadys 'discourse or talk'. But in some contexts 'dis\u00ad\ncourse' is too formal while 'talk' is too colloquial ; the reader must remember that there is \nno good English equivalent for 'Rede'. For a previous discussion see Section 7 B above \n(H. 32-34). \n"

The fact that they \noften do not receive 'verbal' expression, is merely an index of some definite \nkind of discourse which, in so far as it is discourse, must in every case lie \nwithin the totality of the structures we have mentioned. \nAttempts to grasp the 'essence of language' have always taken their \norientation from one or another of these items; and the clues to their \nconceptions of language have been the ideas of 'expression', of 'symbolic \nform', of communication as 'assertion', 1 of the 'making-knoWn' of experi\u00ad\nences, of the 'patterning' of life.

If we have not heard 'aright', it is not by accident \nthat we say we have not 'understood'. Hearing is constitutive for discourse. \nAnd just as linguistic utterance is based on discourse, so is acoustic \nperception on hearing. Listening to . . .  is Dasein's existential way of \nBeing-open as Being-with for Others. Indeed, hearing constitutes the \nprimary and authentic way in which Dasein is open for its ownmost \npotentiality-for-Being-as in hearing the voice of the friend whom every \nDasein carries with it. Dasein hears, because it understands. As a Being\u00ad\nin-the-world with Others, a Being which understands, Dasein is 'in thrall' \nto Dasein-with and to itself; and in this thraldom it \"belongs\" to these. 2 \nBeing-with develops in listening to one another [Aufeinander-horen], \nwhich can be done in several possible ways : following, 3 going along with, \n1 ' .\n\u2022\n.\n der Mitteilung als \"Aussage\" .\n\u2022\n .'

Idle talk is the possibility of understanding every\u00ad\nthing without previously making the thing one's own. If this were done, idle \ntalk would founder; and it already guards against such a danger. Idle talk \nis something which anyone can rake up ; it not only releases one from the \ntask of genuinely understanding, but develops an undifferentiated kind of \nintelligibility, for which nothing is closed off any longer. \nDiscourse, which belongs to the essential state of Dasein's Being and has a \nshare in constituting Dasein's disclosedness, has the possibility of becoming \nidle talk. And when it does so, it serves not so much to keep Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld open for us in an articulated understanding, as rather to close it \noff, and cover up the entities within-the-world. To do this, one need not \naim to deceive. Idle talk does not have the kind of Being which belongs to \nconsciously passing of something as something else. The fact that something \nhas been said groundlessly, and then gets passed along in further retelling, \namounts to perverting the act of disclosing [Erchliessen] into an act of \nclosing off [Verschliessen] . For what is said is always understood proxim\u00ad\nally as 'saying' something-that is, an uncovering something. Thus, by \nits very nature, idle talk is a closing-off, since to go back to the ground of \nwhat is talked about is something which it leaves undone. \nThis closing-off is aggravated afresh by the fact that an understanding \nof what is talked about is supposedly reached in idle talk. Because of this, \nidle talk discourages any new inquiry and any disputation, and in a \npeculiar way suppresses them and holds them back. \nThis way in which things have been interpreted in idle talk has already \nestablished itself in Dasein. There are many things with which we first \nbecome acquainted in this way, and there is not a little which never gets \nbeyond such an average understanding. This everyday way in which \nthings have been interpreted is one into which Dasein has grown in the \nfirst instance, with never a possibility of extrication. In it, out of it, and \nagainst it, all genuine understanding, interpreting, and communicating, \nall re-discovering and appropriating anew, are performed. In no case is a \nDasein, untouched and unseduced by this way in which things have been \ninterpreted, set before the open country of a 'world-in-itself, so that it just \nbeholds what it encounters. The dominance of the public way in which \nthings have been interpreted has already been decisive even for the \npossibilities of having a mood-that is, for the basic way in which Dasein \n1 70 \nlets the world \"matter\" to it.1 The \"they\" prescribes one's state-of-mind, \nand determines what and how one 'sees'. \n1 \u2022. \n\u2022 \n\u2022 tiber die Moglichkeiten des Gestimmtseins entschieden, das heisst tiber die \nGrundart, in der sich das Dasein von der Welt angehen liisst.'

The \nHegelian dialectic found in it its motivating conception, and is possible \nonly on the basis of it. \nThe remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augus\u00ad\ntine, in connection with his Interpretation of concupiscentia.xU \"Ad oculos \nenim videre proprie pertinet.\" (\"Seeing belongs properly to the eyes.\") \n\"Utimur autem hoc verbo etiam in ceteris sensibus cum eos ad cognoscendum \nintendimus.\" (\"But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when \nwe devote them to cognizing.\") \"Neque enim dicimus: audi quid rutilet; aut, \nolfac quam niteat; aut, gusta quam splendeat; aut, palpa quam Julgeat: videri enim \ndicuntur haec omnia.\" (\"For we do not say 'Hear how it glows', or 'Smell \nhow it glistens', or 'Taste how it shines', or 'Feel how it flashes' ; but we \nsay of each, 'See' ; we say that all this is seen.\") \"Dicimus autem non solum, \nvide quid luceat, quod soli oculi sentire possunt.\" (\"We not only say, 'See how \nthat shines', when the eyes alone can perceive it ;\") \"sed etiam, vide quid \nsonet; vide quid oleat; vide quid sapiat; vide quam durum sit;\" (\"but we even \nsay, 'See how that sounds', 'See how that is scented', 'See how that tastes', \n'See how hard that is'.\") \"ldeoque generalis experientia sensuum concupiscentia \nsicut dictum est oculorum vocatur, quia videndi officium in quo primatum oculi \ntenent, etiam ceteri sensus sibi de similitudine usurpant, cum aliquid cognitionis \nexplorant.\" (\"Therefore the experience of the senses in general is designated \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n nicht in der verengten Orientierung am Erkennen, das schon fruh und in der \ngriechischen Philosophie nicht zufallig aus der \"Lust zu sehen\" begriffen wird.' The \nearlier editions have ' . . .  am Erkennen, als welches schon fruh . . .

The most usual version is: 'For thinking \nand being are the same.' Heidegger, however, goes back to the original meaning of vo<iv \nas 'to perceive with the eyes'. \n"

Curiosity is everywhere and nowhere. This mode of \nBeing-in-the-world reveals a new kind of Being of everyday Dasein-a \nkind in \u018fhich Dasein is constantly uprooting itself. \nIdle talk controls even the ways in which one may be curious. It says \nwhat one \"must\" have read and seen. In being everywhere and nowhere, \ncuriosity is delivered over to idle talk. These two everyday modes of \nBeing for discourse and sight are not just present-at-hand side by side in \ntheir tendency to uproot, but either of these ways-to-be drags the other one \nwith it. Curiosity, for which nothing is closed off, and idle talk, for which \nthere is nothing that is not understood, provide themselves (that is, the \nDasein which is in this manner [dem so seienden Dasein]) with the guar\u00ad\nantee of a 'life' which, supposedly, is genuinely 'lively'. But with this \nsupposition a third phenomenon now shows itself, by which the disclosed\u00ad\nness of everyday Dasein is characterized. \nfJ 37\u00b7 Ambiguiry \nWhen, in our everyday Being-with-one-another, we encounter the sort \nof thing which is accessible to everyone, and about which anyone can \nsay anything, it soon becomes impossible to decide what is disclosed in a \ngenuine understanding, and what is not. This ambiguity [Zweideutigkeit] \nextends not only to the world, but just as much to Being-with-one-another \nas such, and even to Dasein's Being towards itself. \nEverything looks as if it were genuinely understood, genuinely taken \nhold of, genuinely spoken, though at bottom it is not; or else it does not \nlook so, and yet at bottom it is. Ambiguity not only affects the way we \navail ourselves of what is accessible for use and enjoyment, and the way \nwe manage it; ambiguity has already established itself in the under\u00ad\nstanding as a potentiality-for-Being, and in the way Dasein projects itself \nand presents itself with possibilities.1 Everyone is acquainted with what \nis up for discussion and what occurs,2 and everyone discusses it; but \neveryone also knows already how to talk about what has to happen first\u00ad\nabout what is not yet up for discussion but 'really' must be done. Already \neveryone has surmised and scented out in advance what Others have also \nsurmised and scented out.

Indeed \nthis interest persists, in a kind of curiosity and idle talk, only so long as \nthere is a possibility of a non-committal just-surmising-with-someone-else. \nBeing \"in on it\" with someone [ das Mit-dabei-sein] when one is on the \nscent, and so long as one is on it, precludes one's allegiance when what \nhas been surmised gets carried out. For in such a case Dasein is in every \ncase forced back on itself. Idle talk and curiosity lose their power, and are \nalready exacting their penalty. 2 When confronted with the carrying\u00ad\nthrough of what \"they\" have surmised together, idle talk readily estab\u00ad\nlishes that \"they\" \"could have done that too\"-for \"they\" have indeed \nsurmised it together. In the end, idle talk is even indignant that what it \nhas surmised and constantly demanded now actualry happens. In that case, \nindeed, the opportunity to keep on surmising has been snatched away. \u00b7 \nBut when Dasein goes in for something in the reticence of carrying it \nthrough or even of genuinely breaking down on it, its time is a different \ntime and, as seen by the public, an essentially slower time than that of \nidle talk, which 'lives at a faster rate'. Idle talk will thus long since have \ngone on to something else which is currently the very newest thing. That \nwhich was earlier surmise and has now been carried through, has come too \nlate if one looks at that which is newest. Idle talk and curiosity take care \nin their ambiguity to ensure that what is genuinely and newly created is \nout of date as soon as it emerges before the public. Such a new creation \ncan become free in its positive possibilities only if the idle talk which covers \nit up has become ineffective, and if the 'common' interest has died away. \nIn the ambiguity of the way things have been publicly interpreted, \ntalking about things ahead of the game and making surmises about them \ncuriously, gets passed off as what is really happening, while taking action \nand carrying something through get stamped as something merely sub\u00ad\nsequent and unimportant. Thus Dasein's understanding in the \"they\" is \nconstantly going wrong [versieht sich] in its projects, as regards the genuine \npossibilities of Being. Dasein is always ambiguously 'there'-that is to say, \nin that public disclosedness of Being-with-one-another where the loudest \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n ist die verfanglichste Weise, in der die Zweideutigkeit Miiglichkeiten des Daseins \nvorgibt, um sie auch schon in ihrer Kraft zu ersticken.'

This \"absorption in . . .  \n\" [Aufgehen bei . . .  \n] has mostly the \ncharacter of Being-lost in the publicness of the \"they\". Dasein has, in the \nfirst instance, fallen away [abgefallen] from itself as an authentic pot\u00ad\nentiality for Being its Self, and has fallen into the 'world'.1 \"Fallenness\" \ninto the 'world' means an absorption in Being-with-one-another, in so far \nas the latter is guided by idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity. Through the \nInterpretation of falling, what we have called the \"inauthenticity\" of \nDaseinx111 may now be defined more precisely. On no account, however, \ndo the terms \"inauthentic\" and \"non-authentic\" signify 'really not', 2 as \nif in this mode of Being, Dasein were altogether to lose its Being. \"In\u00ad\nauthenticity\" does not mean anything like Being-no-longer-in-the-world, \nbut amounts rather to a quite distinctive kind of Being-in-the-world-the \nkind which is completely fascinated by the 'world' and by the Dasein\u00ad\nwith of Others in the \"they\". Not-Being-its-self [Das Nicht-es-selbst-sein] \nfunctions as a positive possibility of that entity which, in its essential con\u00ad\ncern, is absorbed in a world. This kind of not-Being has to be conceived as \nthat kind of Being which is closest to Dasein and in which Dasein main\u00ad\ntains itself for the most part. \nSo neither must we take the fallenness of Dasein as a 'fall' from a purer \nand higher 'primal status'. Not only do we lack any experience of this \nontically, but ontologically we lack any possibilities or clues for Inter\u00ad\npreting it. \nIn falling, Dasein itself as factical Being-in-the-world, is something from \nwhich it has already fallen away. And it has not fallen into some entity \nwhich it comes upon for the first time in the course of its Being, or even \none which it has not come upon at all ; it has fallen into the world, which \nitself belongs to its Being. Falling is a definite existential characteristic \nof Dasein itself. It makes no assertion about Dasein as something present\u00ad\nat-hand, or about present-at-hand relations to entities from which Dasein \n'is descended' or with which Dasein has subsequently wound up in some \nsort of commercium. \nWe would also misunderstand the ontologico-existential structure of \nfalling3 if we were to ascribe to it the sense of a bad and deplorable \nontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of human \nculture might be able to rid themselves. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n und an die \"Welt\" verfallen.' While we shall follow English idioms by translating \n'an die \"Welt\" ' as 'into the \"world\" ' in contexts such as this, the preposition 'into' is \nhardly the correct one. The idea is rather that of falling at the world or collapsing against it. \n2 'Un- und nichteigentlich, bedeutet aber keineswegs \"eigentlich nicht\" \u2022\n.\n .' \n3 'Die ontologisch-existenziale Struktur des Verfallens \u2022\n.\n .'

The alienation of \nfalling-at once tempting and tranquillizing-leads by its own movement, \nto Dasein's getting entangled [verjangt] in itself. \nThe phenomena we have pointed out-temptation, tranquillizing, \nalienation and self-entangling ( entanglement)-characterize the specific \nkind of Being which belongs to falling. This 'movement' of Dasein in its \nown Being, we call its \"downward plunge\" [Absturz]. Dasein plunges out \nof itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic \neverydayness. But this plunge remains hidden from Dasein by 'the way \nthings have been publicly interpreted, so much so, indeed, that it gets \ninterpreted as a way of 'ascending' and 'living concretely'. \nThis downward plunge into and within the groundlessness of the in\u00ad\nauthentic Being of the \"they\", has a kind of motion which constantly \ntears the understanding away from the projecting of authentic possibil\u00ad\nities, and into the tranquilized supposition that it possesses everything, \nor that everything is within its reach. Since the understanding is thus \nconstantly torn away from authenticity and into the \"they\" (though \nalways with a sham of authenticity), the movement of falling is charac\u00ad\nterized by turbulence [Wirbel]. \nFalling is not only existentially determinative for Being-in-the-world. \n1 79 \nAt the same time turbulence makes manifest that the thrownness which \ncan obtrude itself upon Dasein in its state-of-mind, has the character of \nthrowing and of movement. Thrownness is neither a 'fact that is finished' \nnor a Fact that is settled.1 Dasein's facticity is such that as long as it is \nwhat it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and is sucked into the turbulence \nof the \"they's\" inauthenticity. Thrownness, in which facticity lets itself \nbe seen phenomenally, belongs to Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very \nBeing is an issue. Dasein exists factically. \nBut now that falling has been exhibited, have we not set forth a phe\u00ad\nnomenon which speaks directly against the definition we have used in \nindicating the formal idea of existence? Can Dasein be conceived as an \nentity for which, in its Being, its potentiality-for-Being is an issue, if this \nentity, in its very everydayness, has lost itself, and, in falling, 'lives' away \nfrom itself? But falling into the world would be phenomenal 'evidence' \nagainst the existentiality of Dasein only if Dasein were regarded as an \nisolated \"I\" or subject, as a self-point from which it moves away. In that \ncase, the world would be an Object. Falling into the world would then \nhave to be re-Interpreted ontologically as Being-present-at-hand in the \nmanner of an entity within-the-world.

Does our present approach via \nthe existential analytic provide us an avenue for arriving at this Being \nphenomenally? \nTo put it negatively, it is beyond question that the totality of the \nstructural whole is not to be reached by building it up out of elements. \nFor this we would need an architect's plan. The Being of Dasein, upon \nwhich the structural whole as such is ontologically supported, becomes \naccessible to us when we look all the way through this whole to a single \nprimordially unitary phenomenon which is already in this whole in such \na way that it provides the ontological foundation for each structural item \nin its structural possibility. Thus we canot Interpret this 'comprehen\u00ad\nsively' by a process of gathering up what we have hitherto gained and \ntaking it all together. The question of Dasein's basic existeniial character \nis essentially different from that of the Being of something present-at\u00ad\nhand.

On the other hand, Dasein's Being is not be to \ndeduced from an idea of man. Does the Interpretation ofDasein which we \nhave hitherto given permit us to infer what Dasein,from its own standpoint, \ndemands as the only appropriate ontico-ontological way of access to itself? \nAn understanding of Being belongs to Dasein's ontological structure. \nAs something that is [Seiend], it is disclosed to itself in its Being. The \nkind of Being which belongs to this disclosedness is constituted by state\u00ad\nof-mind and understanding. Is there in Dasein an understanding state\u00ad\nof-mind in which Dasein has been disclosed to itself in some distinctive \nway? \nIf the existential analytic of Dasein is to retain clarity in principle as to \nits function in fundamental ontology, then in order to master its provis\u00ad\nional task of exhibiting Dasein's Being, it must seek for one of the most far\u00ad\nreaching and most primordial possibilities of disclosure-me that lies in \nDasein itself.

But one is not necessarily \nfleeing whenever one shrinks back in the face of something or turns away \nfrom it.

The only threatening which can be \nx86 \n'fearsome' and which gets discovered in fear, always comes from entities \nwithin-the-world. \nThus the turning-away offalling is not a fleeing that is founded upon a \nfear of entities within-the-world. Fleeing that is so grounded is still less \na character of this turning-away, when what this turning-away does is \nprecisely to tum thither towards entities within-the-world by absorbing \nitself in them. The turning-away of falling is grounded rather in anxiety, which in \nturn is what first makes fear possible. \nTo understand this talk about Dasein's fleeing in the face of itself in \nfalling, we must recall that Being-in-the-world is a basic state of Dasein. \nThat in the face of which one has anxiety [ das Wovor der Angst] is Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld as such.

That in the \nface of which one is anxious is completely indefinite. Not only does this \nindefiniteness leave factically undecided which entity within-the-world is \nthreatening us, but it also tells us that entities within-the-world are not \n'relevant' at al.

In anxiety one does not encounter this thing or that thing \nwhich, as something threatening, must have an involvement. \nAccordingly, when something threatening brings itself close, anxiety \ndoes not 'see' any definite 'here' or 'yonder' from which it comes.

So if the \"nothing\"-that is, the world as such\u00ad\nexhibits itself as that in the face of which one has anxiety, this means \nthat Being-in-the-world itself is that in the face of which anxiery is anxious. \nBeing-anxious discloses, primordially and directly, the world as world. \nIt is not the case, say, that the world first gets thought of by deliberating \nabout it, just by itself, without regard for the entities within-the-world, \nand that, in the face of this world, anxiety then arises ; what is rather the \ncase is that the world as world is disclosed first and foremost by anxiety, as \na mode of state-of-mind. This does not signify, however, that in anxiety \nthe worldhood of the world gets conceptualized. \nAnxiety is not only anxiety in the face of something, but, as a state-of\u00ad\nmind, it is also anxiery about something. That which anxiety is profoundly \nanxious [sich abangstet] about is not a definite kind of Being for Dasein or \na definite possibility for it. Indeed the threat itself is indefinite, and there\u00ad\nfore cannot penetrate threateningly to this or that factically concrete \npotentiality-for-Being. That which anxiety is anxious about is Being-in\u00ad\nthe world itself. In anxiety what is environmentally ready-to-hand sinks \naway, and so, in general, do entities within-the-world. The 'world' can \noffer nothing more, and neither can the Dasein-with of Others. Anxiety \nthus takes away from Dasein the possibility of understanding itself, as it \nfalls, in terms of the 'world' and the way things have been publicly inter\u00ad\npreted. Anxiety throws Dasein back upon that which it is anxious about \n-its authentic potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world. Anxiety individualizes \nDasein for its ownmost Being-in-the-world, which as something that under\u00ad\nstands, projects itself essentially upon possibilities. Therefore, with that \n188 \nwhich it is anxious about, anxiety discloses Dasein as Being-possible, and \nindeed as the only kind of thing which it can be of its own accord as \nsomething individualized in individualization [vereinzeltes in der Verein\u00ad\nzelung]. \nAnxiety makes manifest in Dasein its Being towards its ownmost poten\u00ad\ntiality-for-Being-that is, its Being-free for the freedom of choosing itself \nand taking hold of itself. Anxiety brings Dasein face to face with its Being\u00ad\nfree for (propensio in \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ) the authenticity of its Being, and for this authen\u00ad\nticity as a possibility which it always is. 2 But at the same time, this is the \n1 'Allein dieses Nichts von Zuhandenem, das die alltiigliche umsichtige Rede einzig \nversteht, ist kein totales Nichts.'

The \nphrase 'is an issue' has been made plain in the state-of-Being of under\u00ad\nstanding-of understanding as self-projective Being towards its ownmost \npotentiality-for-Being. This poten#ality is that for the sake of which any \nDasein is as it is. In each case Dasein has already compared itself, in its \nBeing, with a possibility of itself. Being-free for one's ownmost potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being, and therewith for the possibility of authenticity and inauthen\u00ad\nticity, is shown, with a primordial, elemental concreteness, in anxiety. \nBut ontologically, Being towards one's ownmost potentiality-for-Being \nmeans that in each case Dasein is already ahead of itself [ihm selbst . . .  \n192 \nvorweg] in its Being. Dasein is always 'beyond itself' [\"iiber sich hinaus\"), \nnot as a way of behaving towards other entities which it is not, but as \nBeing towards the potentiality-for-Being which it is itself.

In the phenomenon of willing, the under\u00ad\nlying totality of care shows through. \nAs something factical, Dasein's projection of itself understandingly is \nin each case already alongside a world that has been discovered. From \nthis world it takes its possibilities, and it does so first in accordance with \nthe way things have been interpreted by the \"they\".

The \"ahead\u00ad\nof-itself-in-Being-already-in \n\u2022\n.\n.\n \" is correspondingly modified.

IfDasein, as it were, sinks into an addiction \nthen there is not merely an addiction present-at-hand, but the entire \nstructure of care has been modified. Dasein has become blind, and puts \nall possibilities into the service of the addiction. \nOn the other hand, the urge 'to live' is something 'towards' which one \nis impelled, and it brings the impulsion along with it of its own accord. 3 \nIt is 'towards this at any price'. The urge seeks to crowd out [verdrangen] \nother possibilities.

The urge can outrun one's current state-of-mind \nI g6 \nand one's understanding. But then Dasein is not-and never is-a 'mere \nurge' to which other kinds of controlling or guiding behaviour are added \nfrom time to time; rather, as a modification of the entirety of Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world, it is always care already. \nIn pure urge, care has not yet become free, though care first makes it \nontologically possible for Dasein to be urged on by itself.'

But because these are both grounded ontologically in care, and only \nbecause of this, they are both to be modified in an ontical and existentiell \nmanner by care-by care as something authentic. \nWith the expression 'care' we have in mind a basic existential-onto\u00ad\nlogical phenomenon, which all the same is not simple in its structure.

To do this it was necessary from the outset \nto change the direction of our analysis from the approach presented by the \ntraditional definition of \"man\"-an approach which has not been \nclarified ontologically and is in principle questionable.

'Being-in-the-world' has the stamp of 'care', which \naccords with its Being. It gets the name \"homo\" not in consideration of its \nBeing but in relation to that of which it consists (humus). The decision as \nto wherein the 'primordial' Being of this creature is to be seen, is left to \nSaturn, 'Time'.vl Thus the pre-ontological characterization of man's \n199 \nessence expressed in this fable, has brought to view in advance the kind \nof Being which dominates his temporal sojourn in the world, and does so \nthrough and through. \nThe history of the signification of the ontical concept of 'care' permits \nus to see still further basic structures ofDasein. Burdach vu calls attention \nto a double meaning of the term 'cura' according to which it signifies not \nonly 'anxious exertion' but also 'carefulness' and 'devotedness' [\"Sorg\u00ad\nfalt\", \"Hingabe\"]. Thus Seneca writes in his last epistle (Ep. 124) : \n'Among the four existent Natures (trees, beasts, man, and God), the latter \ntwo, which alone are endowed with reason, are distinguished in that God \nis immortal while man is mortal. Now when it comes to these, the good \nof the one, namely God, is fulfilled by his Nature; but that of the other, \nman, is fulfilled by care (cura) : \"unius bonum natura perjicit, dei scilicet, \nalterius cura, hominis.\" \nMan's perfectio-his transformation into that which he can be in Being\u00ad\nfree for his ownmost possibilities (projection)-is 'accomplished' by 'care'. \nBut with equal primordiality 'care' determines what is basically specific \nin this entity, according to which it has been surrendered to the world \nof its concern (thrownness). In the 'double meaning' of 'care', what we \nhave in view is a single basic state in its essentially twofold structure of \nthrown projection. \nAs compared with this ontical interpretation, the existential-ontological \nInterpretation is not, let us say, merely an ontical generalization which is \ntheoretical in character. That would just mean that ontically all man's \nways of behaving are 'full of care' and are guided by his 'devotedness' to \ncorrespond strictly to the double quotation marks in Heidegger's version; some of these \nare not found in Burdach's translation, which, except for two entirely trivial changes, \nHeidegger has otherwise reproduced very accurately. (On Biicheler and Burdach, see \nHeidegger's note v, ad Joe.) Our translation is a compromise between Burdach and the \noriginal Latin. \n"

Our analysis ofDasein's disclosedness showed further that, with \nthis disclosedness, Dasein, in its basic state of Being-in-the-world, has been \nrevealed equiprimordially with regard to the world, Being-in, and the \nSelf. Furthermore, in the factical disclosedness of the world, entities \nwithin-the-world are discovered too. This implies that the Being of these \nentities is always understood in a certain manner, even if it is not conceived \nin a way which is appropriately ontological. To be sure, the pre-onto-\n201 \nlogical understanding of Being embraces all entities which are essentially \ndisclosed in Dasein ; but the understanding of Being has not yet Arti\u00ad\nculated itself in a way which corresponds to the various modes of Being. \nAt the same time our interpretation of understanding has shown that, \nin accordance with its falling kind ofBeing,-it has, proximally and for the \nmost part, diverted itself [sich \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n verlegt] into an understanding of the \n'world'. Even where the issue is not only one of ontical experience but \nalso one of ontological understanding, the interpretation of Being takes its \norientation in the first instance from the Being of entities within-the\u00ad\nworld. Thereby the Being of what is proximally ready-to-hand gets passed \nover, and entities are first conceived as a context ofThings (res) which are \npresent-at-hand. \"Being\" acquires the meaning of \"Realiry\".v111 Sub\u00ad\nstantiality becomes the basic characteristic of Being. Corresponding to this \nway in which the understanding of Being' has been diverted, even the \nontological understanding of Dasein moves into the horizon of this con\u00ad\nception of Being. Like any other entity, Dasein too is present-at-hand as Real. \nIn this way \"Being in general\" acquires the meaning of\"Realiry\". Accord\u00ad\ningly the concept of Reality has a peculiar priority in the ontological \nproblematic. By this priority the route to a genuine existential analytic \nofDasein gets diverted, and so too does our very view of the Being of what \nis proximally ready-to-hand within-the-world. It finally forces the general \nproblematic of Being into a direction that lies off the course. The other \nmodes of Being become defined negatively and privatively with regard to \nReality. \nThus not only the analytic ofDasein but the working-out of the question \nof the meaning of Being in general must be turned away from a one-sided \norientation with regard to Being in the sense of Reality. We must demon\u00ad\nstrate that Reality is not only one kind of Being among others, but that onto\u00ad\nlogically it has a definite connection in its foundations with Dasein, the \nworld, and readiness-to-hand. To demonstrate this we must discuss in \nprinciple the problem of Realiry, its conditions and its limits. \nUnder the heading 'problem of Reality' various questions are clustered : \n(I) whether any entities which supposedly 'transcend our consciousness' \n"

Thus from the very beginning, \nBeing-in-a-world is disposed to \"take things\" in some way [Auffassen], to \nsuppose, to be certain, to have faith-a way of behaving which itself is \nalways a founded mode of Being-in-the-world. \nThe 'problem of Reality' in the sense ofthe question whether an external \nworld is present-at-hand and whether such a world can be proved, turns \nout to be an impossible one, not because its consequences lead to inextric\u00ad\nable impasses, but because the very entity which serves as its theme, is \none which, as it were, repudiates any such formulation of the question. \nOur task is not to prove that an 'external world' is present-at-hand or to \nshow how it is present-at-hand, but to point out why Dasein, as Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world, has the tendency to bury the 'external world' in nullity \n'epistemologically' before going on to prove it.1 The reason for this lies \nin Dasein's falling and in the way in which the primary understanding of \nBeing has been diverted to Being as presence-at-hand-a diversion which \nis motivated by that falling itself. If one formulates the question 'critically' \nwith such an ontological orientation, then what one finds present-at\u00ad\nhand as proximally and solely certain, is something merely 'inner'. Mter \nthe primordial phenomenon of Being-in-the-world has been shattered, \nthe isolated subject is all that remains, and this becomes the basis on which \nit gets joined together with a 'world'. \nIn this investigation we cannot discuss at length the many attempts to \nsolve the 'problem of Reality' which have been developed in various \nkinds of realism and idealism and in positions which mediate between \n207 \nthem. Certainly a grain of genuine inquiry is to be found in each of these ; \nbut certain as this is, it would be just as perverse if one should want to \nachieve a tenable solution of the problem by reckoning up how much \nhas been correct in each case. What is needed rather is the basic insight \nthat while the different epistemological directions which have been pur\u00ad\nsued have not gone so very far off epistemologically, their neglect of any \nexistential analytic of Dasein has kept them from obtaining any basis for \na well secured phenomenal problematic.

He writes: 'For the \"it\" which here \"gives\" is Being itself. \nThe \"gives\", however, designates the essence of Being, which gives and which confers its \ntruth.'

Together with this we must clarify the ontological meaning \nof the kind of talk in which we say that 'there is truth', and we must \nalso clarify the kind of necessity with which 'we must presuppose' that \n'there is' truth (c). \n(a) The Traditional Conception of Truth, and its Ontological Foundations \nThere are three theses which characterize the way in which the essence \nof truth has been traditionally taken and the way it is supposed to have \nbeen first defined: (1) that the 'locus' of truth is assertion (judgment) ; \n(2) that the essence of truth lies in the 'agreement' of thV judgment with \nits object; (3) that Aristotle, the father of logic, not only has assigned \ntruth to the judgment as its primordial locus but has set going the defini\u00ad\ntion of \"truth\" as 'agreement' . 1  \nHere it is not our aim to provide a history of the concept of truth, which \ncould be presented only on the basis of a history of ontology. We shall \nintroduce our analytical discussions by alluding to some familiar matters. \nAristotle says that the 7TaO\u011fp,ara Tfj!; ifivxfj!; are TWV 7Tpayp,arwv op,oulJ\u00ad\np.araXXix_that the soul's 'Experiences', its vo\u011fp,ara ('representations'), \nare likenings of Things. This assertion, which is by no means proposed as \nan explicit definition of the essence of truth, has also given occasion for \ndeveloping the later formulation of the essence of truth ' as adaequatio \nintellectus et rei. 2 Thomas Aquinas,xxx who refers this definition to Avicenna \n(who, in turn, has taken it over from Isaac Israeli's tenth-century 'Book of \nDefinitions') also uses for \"adaequatio\" (likening) the terms \"correspondentia\" \n(\"correspondence\") and \"convenientia\" (\" coming together\"). \n1 Here we follow the older editions in reading ' . . .  hat sowohl die Wahrheit dem Urteil \nals ihrem urspriinglichen Ort zugewiesen als auch die Definition der Wahrheit als \n\"Ubereinstimmung\" in Gang gebracht.' The newer editions read ' .\n.\n\u2022\n hat sowohl \u2022\n.\n.\n \nzugewiesen, er hat auch . .  \n.' \n2 This is usually translated as 'adequation of the intellect and the thing'. Heidegger \nmakes the connection seem closer by translating both the Latin adaequatio and the Greek \nOJLolwp.a by the word 'Angleichung', which we have somewhat arbitrarily translated as \n'likening'. \n"

But Kant too adhered to this conception of truth, so much so \nthat he did not even bring it up for discussion; this has been overlooked, \nthough Brentano has already called our attenti<.n to it. 'The old and \ncelebrated question with which it was supposed that one might drive the \nlogicians into a corner is this: \"what is truth?\" The explanation of the \nname of truth-namely, that it is the agreement of knowledge with its \nobject-will here be granted and presupposed . .  ;xxt. \n'If truth consists in the agreement ofknowledge with its object, then this \nobject must thus be distinguished from others; for knowledge is false if it \ndoes not agree with the object to which it is related, even if it should \ncontain something which might well be valid for other objects.'xxU And \nin the introduction to the \"Transcendental Dialectic\" Kant states : 'Truth \nand illusion are not in the object so far as it is intuited, but in the judg\u00ad\nment about it so far as it is thought. \u2022xxtu \nOf course this characterization of truth as 'agreement', adaequatio, \nOJLolwcns, is very general and empty. Yet it will still have some justifica\u00ad\ntion if it can hold its own without prejudice to any of the most various \nInterpretations which that distinctive predicate \"knowledge\" will support. \nWe are now inquiring into the foundations of this 'relation'. What else is \ntacit(\u00bb posited in this relational totaliry of the adaequatio intellectus et rei? \nAnd what ontological character does that which is thus posited have itself? \nWhat in general does one have in view when one uses the term 'agree\u00ad\nment' ? The agreement of something with something has the formal \ncharacter of.a relation of something to something. Every agreement, and \ntherefore 'truth' as well, is a relation. But not every relation is an agree\u00ad\nment. A sign points at what is indicated.1 Such indicating is a relation, \nbut not an agreement of the sign with what is indicated. Yet manifestly \nnot every agreement is a convenientia of the kind that is fixed upon in the \ndefinition of \"truth\". The number \"6\" agrees with \"16 minus 10\". These \n2 16 \nnumbers agree; they are equal with regard to the question of \"how \nmuch ?\" Equality is one way of agreeing. Its structure is such that something \nlike a 'with-regard-to' belongs to it. In the adaequatio something gets \nrelated; what is that with regard to which it agrees ? In clarifying the \n'truth-relation' we must notice also what is peculiar to the terms of this \nrelation. With regard to what do intellectus and res agree ? In their kind of \nBeing and their essential content do they give us anything at all with \n1 'Ein Zeichen zeigt auf das Gezeigte.' \n"

What \nmakes this very uncovering possible must necessarily be called 'true' in \na still more primordial sense. The most primordial phenomenon of truth is first \nshown by the existential-ontological foundations of uncovering. \nUncovering is a way of Being for Being-in-the-world.

They are 'true' in a second sense. What is primarily \n'true'-that is, uncovering-is Dasein. \"Truth\" in the second sense does \nnot mean Being-uncovering* (uncovering), but Being-uncovered (un\u00ad\ncoveredness). \nOur earlier analysis of the worldhood of the world and of entities within\u00ad\nthe-world has shown, however, that the uncoveredness of entities within\u00ad\nthe-world is grounrled in the world's disclosedness.

Our version reflects the ambiguity of the \nGerman, which leaves the grammatical function of the pronoun 'sie' obscure and permits \nit to refer either to 'the disclosedness of Dasein', to 'care', or-perhaps most likely-to \n'the structure of care'. \n"

As something that understands, Dasein \ncan understand itself in terms of the 'world' and Others or in terms of its \nownmost potentiality-for-Being. 2 The possibility just mentioned means \nthat Dasein discloses itself to itself in and as its ownmost potentiality-for \nBeing. This authentic disclosedness shows the phenomenon of the most \nprimordial truth in the mode of authenticity. The most primordial, and \nindeed the most authentic, disclosedness in which Dasein, as a potent\u00ad\niality-for-Being, can be, is the truth of existence.

Its absorption in the \n\"they\" signifies that it is dominated by the way things are publicly \ninterpreted. That which has been uncovered and disclosed stands in a \nmode in which it has been disguised and closed off by idle talk, curiosity, \nand ambiguity. Being towards entities has not been extinguished, but it \nhas been uprooted. Entities have not been completely hidden ; they are \nprecisely the sort of thing that has been uncovered, but at the same time \nthey have been disguised. They show themselves, but in the mode of \nsemblance. Likewise what has formerly been uncovered sinks back again, \nhidden and disguised. Because Dasein is essentially falling, its state of Being is \nsuch that it is in 'untruth'. This term, like the expression 'falling', is here \nused ontologically.

Thus the \nroots of the truth of assertion reach back to the disclosedness of the under\u00db \nstanding.xl But over and above these indications of how the truth of \nassertion has originated, the phenomenon of agreement must not be \nexhibited explicit[y in its derivative character. \nOur Being alongside entities within-the-world is concern, and this is \nBeing which uncovers. To Dasein's disclosedness, however, discourse \nbelongs essentially.xll Dasein expresses itself [spricht sich a us] : it expresses \n224 \nitself as a Being-towards entities-a Being-towards which uncovers. And \nin assertion it expresses itself as such about entities which have been \nuncovered. Assertion communicates entities in the \"how\" of their un\u00dc \ncoveredness.

What is expressed \nbecomes, as it were, something ready-to-hand within-the-world which can \nbe taken up and spoken again.1 Because the uncoveredness has been \npreserved, that which is expressed (which thus is ready-to-hand) has in \nitself a relation to any entities about which it is, an assertion. Any un\u00ad\ncoveredness is an uncoveredness of something. Even when Dasein speaks \nover again what someone else has said, it comes into a Being-towards the \nvery entities which have been discussed. 3 But it has been exempted from \nhaving to uncover them again, primordially, and it holds that it has \nbeen thus exempted. \nDasein need not bring itself face to face with entities themselves in an \n'original' experience ; but it nevertheless remains in a Being-towards these \nentities. In a large measure uncoveredness gets appropriated not by one's \nown uncovering, but rather by hearsay of something that has been said. \n1 'Das Ausgesprochene wird gleichsam zu einem innerweldich Zuhandenen, das \naufgenommen und weitergesprochen werden kann.'

As long as such a proof is still outstanding, this principle \nremains a fanciful contention which does not gain in legitimacy from \nhaving philosophers commonly 'believe' it. \nBecause the kind of Being that is essential to truth is of the character of Dasein, \nall truth is relative to Dasein's Being. Does this relativity signify that all truth \nis 'subjective' ?  If one Interprets 'subjective' as 'left to the subject's discre\u00ad\ntion', then it certainly does not. For uncovering, in the sense which is most \nits own, takes asserting out of the province of 'subjective' discretion, and \nbrings the uncovering Dasein face to face with the entities themselves. \nAnd only because 'truth', as uncovering, is a kind of Being which belongs to \nDasein, can it be taken out of the province of Dasein's discretion. Even the \n'universal validity' of truth is rooted solely in the fact that Dasein can \nuncover entities in themselves and free them. Only so can these entities \nin themselves be binding for every possible assertion-that is, for \nevery way of pointing them out.1 If truth has been correctly under\u00ad\nstood, is it in the least impaired by the fact that it is ontically possible \nonly in the 'subject' and that it stands and falls with the Being of that \n'subject' ? \nNow that we have an existential conception of the kind of Being that \nbelongs to truth, the meaning of \"presupposing the truth11 also becomes \nintelligible. Why must we presuppose that there is truth? What is 'presupposing' ? \nWhat do we have in mind with the 'must' and the 'we' ? What does it \nmean to say 'there is truth' ? 'We' presuppose truth because 'we', being \nin the kind of Being which Dasein possesses, are 'in the truth'. We do not \npresuppose it as something 'outside' us and 'above' us, towards which, \nalong with other 'values', we comport ourselves. It is not we who pre\u00ad\nsuppose 'truth' ; but it is 'truth' that makes it at all possible ontologically \n228 \nfor us to be able to be such that we 'presuppose' anything at all. Truth is \nwhat first makes possible anything like presupposing. \nWhat does it mean to 'presuppose' ? It is to understand something as \nthe ground for the Being of some other entity. Such understanding of an \nentity in its interconnections of Being, is possible only on the ground of \ndisclosedness-that is, on the ground of Dasein's Being something which \nuncovers. Thus to presuppose 'truth' means to understand it as something \nfor the sake of which Dasein i s. But Dasein is already ahead of itself in \neach case ; this is implied in its state-of-Being as care. It is an entity for \nwhich, in its Being, its ownmost potentiality-for-Being is an issue.

In \nDasein's state-of-Being as care, in Being-ahead-of-itself, lies the most \nprimordial 'presupposing'. Because this presupposing of itself belongs to Dasein' s \nBeing, 'we' must also presuppose 'ourselves' as having the attribute of disclosedness. \nThere are also entities with a character other than that of Dasein, but the \n'presupposing' which lies in Dasein's Being does not relate itself to these ; \nit relates itself solely to Dasein itself. The truth which has been pre\u00ad\nsupposed, or the 'there is' by which its Being is to be defined, has that \nkind of Being-or meaning of Being-which belongs to Dasein itself. We \nmust 'make' the presupposition of truth because it is one that has been \n'made' already with the Being of the 'we'. \nWe must presuppose truth. Dasein itself, as in each case m y  Dasein and \nthis Dasein, must be ; and in the same way the truth, as Dasein's dis\u00ad\nclosedness, must be.

The usual refutation of that scepticism which denies \neither the Being of 'truth' or its cognizability, stops half way. What it \nshows, as a formal argument, is simply that if anything gets judged, truth \nhas been presupposed. This suggests that 'truth' belongs to assertion-\nthat pointing something out is, by its very meaning, an uncovering.

And if any sceptic of the kind who denies the truth, factically is, \nhe does not even need to be refuted. In so far as he is, and has understood \nhimself in this Being, he has obliterated Dasein in the desperation of \nsuicide; and in doing so, he has also obliterated truth. Because Dasein, \nfor its own part, cannot first be subjected to proof, the necessity of truth \ncannot be proved either.

This end, which belongs to the potent\u00ad\niality-for-Being-that is to say, to existence-limits and determines m \nevery case whatever totality is possible for Dasein. If, however, Dasein's \nBeing-at-an-end 1 in death, and therewith its Being-a-whole, are to be \nincluded in the discussion of its possibly Being-a-whole, and if this is to be \ndone in a way which is appropriate to the phenomena, then we must have \nobtained an ontologically adequate conception of death-that is to say \nan exister:ztial conception of it. But as something of the character of Dasein, \ndeath is only in an existentiell Being towards death [Sein \u0135um Tode]. The \nexistential structure of such Being proves to be the ontologically constitu\u00ad\ntive state of Dasein's potentiality-for-Being-a-whole. Thus the whole \nexisting Dasein allows itself to be brought into our existential fore-having. \nBut can Dasein also exist authentically as a whole ? How is the authenticity \nof existence to be determined at all, if not with regard to authentic \nexisting? Where do we get our criterion for this ? Manifestly, Dasein \nitself must, in its Being, present us with the possibility and the manner of \nits authentic existence, unless such existence is something that can be \nimposed upon it ontically, or ontologically fabricated. But an authentic \npotentiality-for-Being is attested by the conscience. And conscience, as a \nphenomenon of Dasein, demands, like death, a genuinely existential \nInterpretation. Such an Interpretation leads to the insight that Dasein has \nan authentic potentiality-for-Being in that it wants to have a conscience. But \nthis is an existentiell possibility which tends, from the very meaning of its \nBeing, to be made definite in an existentiell way by Being-towards-death. \nBy pointing out that Dasein has an authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole, \nthe existential analytic acquires assurance as to the constitution ofDasein's \nprimordial Being. But at the same time the authentic potentiality-for-Being\u00ad\na-whole becomes visible as a mode of care. And therewith the pheno\u00ad\nmenally adequate ground for a primordial Interpretation of the meaning \nof Dasein's Being has also been assured. \nBut the primordial ontological basis for Dasein's existentiality is tem\u00ad\nporality. In terms of temporality, the articulated structural totality of \nDasein's Being as care first becomes existentially intelligible. The Inter\u00ad\npretation of the meaning of Dasein's Being cannot stop with this demon\u00ad\nstration. The existential-temporal analysis of this entity needs to be \nconfirmed concretely. We must go back and lay bare in their temporal \nmeaning the ontological structures of Dasein which we have previously \nobtained. Everydayness reveals itself as a mode of temporality. But by \nthus recapitulating our preparatory fundamental analysis of Dasein, we \n1 'Zu-Ende-sein'. This expression is to be distinguished from 'Sein-zum-Ende', which \nwe shall translate as 'Being-towards-the-end'. \n"

It is necessary for us \n236 \nto bring the whole Dasein into our fore-having. We must accordingly ask \nwhether this entity, as something existing, can ever become accessible in \nits Being-a-whole. In Dasein's very state of Being, there are important \nreasons which seem to speak against the possibility of having it presented \n[Vorgabe] in the manner required. \nThe possibility of this entity's Being-a-whole is manifestly inconsistent \nwith the ontological meaning of care, and care is that which forms the \ntotality of Dasein's structural whole. Yet the primary item in care is \nthe 'ahead-of-itself', and this means that in every case Dasein exists for the \nsake of itself. 'As long as it is', right to its end, it comports itself towards its \npotentiality-for-Being. Even when it still exists but has nothing more \n'before it' and has 'settled [ abgeschlossen] its account', its Being is still \ndetermined by the 'ahead-of-itself'. Hopelessness, for instance, does not \ntear Dasein away from its possibilities, but is only one of its own modes of \nBeing towards these possibilities. Even when one is without Illusions and \n'is ready for an.ything' [\"Gefasstsein auf Alles\"], here too the 'ahead-of\u00ad\nitself' lies hidden. The 'ahead-of-itself', as an item in the structure of care, \ntells us unambiguously that in Dasein there is always something still \noutstanding, 1 which, as a potentiality-for-Being for Dasein itself, has not \nyet become 'actual'. It is essential to the basic constitution ofDasein that \nthere is constantly something still to be settled [eine stiindige Unabgeschlossenheit]. \nSuch a lack of totality signifies that there is something still outstanding in \none's potentiality-for-Being. \n1 ' . . .  im Dasein immer noch etwas aussteht .\n\u2022\n .' The verb 'ausstehen' and the noun \n'Ausstand' (which we usually translate as 'something still outstanding', etc.), are ordin\u00ad\narily used in German to apply to a debt or a bank deposit which, from the point of view \nof the lender or depositor, has yet to be repaid to him, liquidated, or withdrawn. \n"

I \nwill guarantee the possibility of an ontological Interpretation of death. \nBut even if the analysis of Dasein's end and totality takes on so broad \nan orientation, this cannot mean that the existential concepts of end and \ntotality are to be obtained by way of a deduction. On the contrary, the \ne:ristential meaning of Dasein's coming-to-an-end must be taken from \nDasein itself, and we must show how such 'ending' can constitute Being\u00ad\na-whole for the entity which exists. \nWe may formulate in three theses the discussion of death up to this \npoint : 1 .  there belongs to Dasein, as long as it is, a \"not-yet\" which it \nwill be-that which is constantly still outstanding; 2. the coming-to-its-end \nof what-is-not-yet-at-an-end (in which what is still outstanding is liquid\u00ad\nated as regards its Being) has the character ofno-longer-Dasein ; 3\u00b7 coming\u00ad\nto-an-end implies a mode of Being in which the particular Dasein simply \ncannot be represented by someone else. \nIn Dasein there is undeniably a constant 'lack of totality' which finds \nan end with death. This \"not-yet\" 'belongs' to Dasein as long as it is ; \nthis is how things stand phenomenally. Is this to be Interpreted as still \noutstanding?1 With relation to what entities do we talk about that which \nis still outstanding ? When we use this expression we have in view that \nwhich indeed 'belongs' to an entity, but is still missing. Outstanding, as a \nway of being missing, is grounded upon a belonging-to. 2 For instance, the \nremainder yet to be received when a debt is to be balanced off, is still \noutstanding. That which is still outstanding is not yet at one's disposal. \nWhen the 'debt' gets paid off, that which is still outstanding gets liquid\u00ad\nated ; this signifies that the money 'comes in', or, in other words, that the \nremainder comes successively along. By this procedure the \"not-yet\" gets \nfilled up, as it were, until the sum that is owed is \"all together\". 3 There\u00ad\nfore, to be still outstanding means that what belongs together is not yet \nall together. Ontologically, this implies the un-readiness-to-hand of those \nportions which have yet to be contributed. These portions have the same \nkind of Being as those which are ready-to-hand already ; and the latter, \nfor their part, do not have their kind of Being modified by having the \nremainder come in. Whatever \"lack-of-togetherness\" remains [Das beste\u00ad\nhende Unzusammen] gets \"paid off' by a cumulative piecing-together. \nEntities for which anything is still outstanding have the kind of Being of something \n1 'Aber darf der phanomenale Tatbestand, dass zum Dasein, solange es ist, dieses \nNoch-nicht \"gehort\", als Ausstand interpretiert werden ?'

But in doing \nso, has it necessarily exhausted its specific possibilities ? Rather, are not \nthese precisely what gets taken away from Dasein? Even 'unfulfilled' \nDasein ends. On the other hand, so little is it the case that Dasein comes \nto its ripeness only with death, that Dasein may well have passed its \nripeness before the end. 3 For the most part, Dasein ends in unfulfilment, \nor else by having disintegrated and been used up. \n1 'Die noch nicht volle Summe ist als Zuhandenes gegen den fehlenden unzuhand'enen \nRest \"gleichgiiltig\".

Notice that the verb 'vollenden', which we \nhere translate as 'fulfil', involves the verb 'enden' ('to end'). While 'vollenden' may mean \n'to bring fully to an end' or 'to terminate', it may also mean 'to complete' or 'to perfect'. \n3 While we have translated 'Reife' by its cognate 'ripeness', this word applies generally \nto almost any kind of maturity, even that of Dasein-not merely the maturity of fruits \nand vegetables, \n"

It thus becomes \nmore urgent to ask in what sense, if any, death must he conceived as the ending \nof Dasein. \nIn the first instance, \"ending\" signifies \"stopping\", and it signifies this \nin senses which are ontologically different. The rain stops. It is no longer \npresent-at-hand. The road stops. Such an ending does not make the road \ndisappear, but such a stopping is determinative for the road as this one, \nwhich is present-at-hand. Hence ending, as stopping, can signify either \n245 \n\"passing over into non-presence-at-hand\" or else \"Being-present-at-hand \nonly when the end comes\". The latter kind of ending, in turn, may either \nbe determinative for something which is present-at-hand in an unfinished \nway, as a road breaks off when one finds it under construction; or it may \nrather constitute the 'finishedness\" of something present-at-hand, as the \npainting is finished with the last stroke of the brush. \nBut ending as \"getting finished\" does not include fulfilling. On the \nother hand, whatever has got to be fulfilled must indeed reach the finished\u00ad\nness that is possible for it. Fulfilling is a mode of 'finishedness', and is \nfounded upon it. Finishedness is itself possible only as a determinate form \nof something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand. \nEven ending in the sense of \"disappearing\" can still have its modifica\u00ad\ntions according to the kind of Being which an entity may have. The rain \nis at an end-that is to say it has disappeared. The bread is at an end\u00ad\nthat is to say, it has been used up and is no longer available as something \nready-to-hand. \nBy none of these modes of ending can death he suitably characterized as the \"end\" \nof Dasein. If dying, as Being-at-an-end, were understood in the sense of an \nending of the kind we have discussed, then Dasein would thereby be \ntreated as something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand. In death, Dasein \nhas not been fulfilled nor has it simply disappeared ; it has not become \nfinished nor is it wholly at one's disposal as something ready-to-hand. \nOn the contrary, just as Dasein is already its \"not-yet\", and is its \n\"not-yet\" constantly as long as it is, it is already its end too. The \"ending\" \nwhich we have in view when we speak of death, does not signify Dasein's \nBeing-at-an-end [Zu-Ende-sein], but a Being-towards-the-end [Sein zum \nEnde] of this entity. Death is a way to be, which Dasein takes over as soon \nas it is. \"As soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die.'iv \nEnding, as Being-towards-the-end, must be clarified ontologically in \nterms of Dasein's kind of Being. And presumably the possibility of an \nexistent Being of that \"not-yet\" which lies 'before' the 'end', 1 will become \n1 ' .\n\u2022\n.\n die Mi:iglichkeit eines existierenden Seins des Noch-nicht, das \"vor\" dem \"Ende\" \nliegt .\n\u2022\n.\n ' The earlier editions have ' .\n\u2022\n.\n das ja \"vor\" dem \"Ende\" . . .

The 'kinds' of death, the causes, 'contrivances' \nand ways in which it makes its entry, can be explored.v \nUnderlying this biological-ontical exploration of death is a problematic \nthat is ontological. We still have to ask how the ontological essence of \ndeath is defined in terms of that of life. In a certain way, this has always \n247 \nbeen decided already in the on tical investigation of death. Such investiga-\ntions operate with preliminary conceptions of life and death, which have \nbeen more or less clarified. These preliminary conceptions need to be \nsketched out by the ontology of Dasein. Within the ontology of Dasein, \nwhich is superordinate to an ontology of life, the existential analysis of death \nis, in turn, subordinate to a characterization of Dasein's basic state. The \nending of that which lives we have called 'perishing'. Dasein too 'has' its \ndeath, of the kind appropriate to anything that lives ; and it has it, not in \nontical isolation, but as codetermined by its primordial kind of Being. \nIn so far as this is the case, Dasein too can end without authentically \ndying, though on the other hand, qua Dasein, it does not simply perish. \nWe designate this intermediate phenomenon as its \"demise\".1 Let the term \n\"dying\" stand for that way of Being in which Dasein is towards its death. 2 \nAccordingly we must say that Dasein never perishes. Dasein, however, \ncan demise only as long as it is dying. Medical and biological investiga-\ntion into \"demising\" can obtain results which may even become significant \nontologically if the basic orientation for an existential Interpretation of \ndeath has been made secure. Or must sickness and death in general-\neven from a medical point of view-be primarily conceived as existential \nphenomena ? \nThe existential Interpretation of death takes precedence over any \nbiology and ontology oflife. But it is also the foundation for any investiga\u00ad\ntion of death which is biographical or historiological, ethnological or \npsychological. In any 'typology' of 'dying', as a characterization of the \nconditions under which a demise is 'Experienced' and of the ways in \nwhich it is 'Experienced', the concept of death is already presupposed. \nMoreover, a psychology of 'dying' gives information about the 'living' of \nthe person who is 'dying', rather than about dying itself. This simply \nreflects thefact thatwhen Daseindies-and even when it dies authentically \n-it does not have to do so with an Experience of its factical demising, or \nin such an Experience. Likewise the ways in which death is taken among \n1 'Abkben'. This term, which literally means something like 'living out' one's life, is \nused in ordinary German as a rather legalistic term for a person's death. We shall translate \nit as 'demise' (both as a noun and as a verb), which also has legalistic connotations. But \nthis translation is an arbitrary one, and does not adequately express the meaning which \nHeidegger is explaining. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n Seinsweise, in der das Dasein zu seinem Tode ist.' \n"

If\"death\" is defined as the 'end' ofDasein-that is to say, of Being\u00ad\nin-the-world-this does not imply any ontical decision whether 'after \ndeath' still another Being is possible, either higher or lower, or whether \n248 \nDasein 'lives on' or even 'outlasts' itself and is 'immortal'. Nor is anything \ndecided ontically about the 'other-worldly' and its possibility, any more \nthan about the 'this-worldly' ; 1 it is not as if norms and rules for comporting \noneself towards death were to be proposed for 'edification'. But our \nanalysis of death remains purely 'this-worldly' in so far as it Interprets \nthat phenomenon merely in the way in which it enters into any particular \nDasein as a possibility of its Being. Only when death is conceived in its full \nontological essence can we have any methodological assurance in even asking \nwhat may be after death; only then can we do so with meaning and justifica\u00ad\ntion. Whether such a question is a possible theoretical question at all will \nnot be decided here. The this-worldly ontological Interpretation of death \ntakes precedence over any ontical other-worldly speculation. \nFinally, what might be discussed under the topic of a 'metaphysic of \ndeath' lies outside the domain of an existential analysis of death. Questions \nof how and when death 'came into the world', what 'meaning' it can \nhave and is to have as an evil and affliction in the aggregate of entities\u00ad\nthese are questions which necessarily presuppose an understanding not \nonly of the character of Being which belongs to death, but of the ontology \nof the aggregate of entities as a whole, and especially of the ontological \nclarification of evil and negativity in general. \nMethodologically, the existential analysis is superordinate to the ques\u00ad\ntions of a biology, psychology, theodicy, or theology of death. Taken \nontically, the results of the analysis show the peculiar formality and empti\u00ad\nness of any ontological characterization. However, that must not blind us \nto the rich and complicated structure of the phenomenon. If Dasein in \ngeneral never becomes accessible as something present-at-hand, because \nBeing-possible belongs in its own way to Dasein's kind of Being, even less \nmay we expect that we can simply read off the ontological structure of \ndeath, if death is indeed a distinctive possibility of Dasein. \nOn the other hand, the analysis cannot keep clinging to an idea of death \n1 'Ober das ''Jenseits\" und seine Moglichkeit wird ebensowenig ontisch entschicden \nwie iiber das \"Dicscits\" \u2022\n\u2022\n .'

Preliminary Sketch of the Existential-ontological Structure of Death \nFrom our considerations of totality, end, and that which is still out\u00ad\nstanding, there has emerged the necessity of lnterpreting the phenomenon \nof death as Being-towards-the-end, and of doing so in terms of Dasein's \nbasic state. Only so can it be made plain to what extent Being-a-whole, \nas constituted by Being towards-the-end, is possible in Dasein itself in \nconformity with the structure of its Being. We have seen that care is the \nbasic state of Dasein. The ontological signification of the expression \n\"care\" has been expressed in the 'definition' : \"ahead-of-itself-Being\u00ad\nalready-in (the world) as Being-alongside entities which we encounter \n(within-the-world)\".vll In this are expressed the fundamental character-\nistics ofDasein's Being : existence, in the \"ahead-of-itself\" ; facticity, in the \n250 \n\"Being-already-in\" ; falling, in the \"Being-alongside\". If indeed death \nbelongs in a distinctive sense to the Being ofDasein, then death (or Being\u00ad\ntowards-the-end) must be defined in terms of these characteristics. \nWe must, in the first instance, make plain in a preliminary sketch how \nDasein's existence, facticity, and falling reveal themselves in the pheno\u00ad\nmenon of death. \nThe Interpretation in which the \"not-yet-and with it even the utter\u00ad\nmost \"not-yet\", the end of Dasein-:-was taken in the sense of something \nstill outstanding, has been rejected as inappropriate in that it included the \nontological perversion of making Dasein something present-at-hand. \nBeing-at-an-end implies existentially Being-towards-the-end. The utter\u00ad\nmost \"not-yet\" has the character of something towards which Dasein \ncomports itself. The end is impending [steht . . .  bevor] for Dasein. Death is \nnot something not yet present-at-hand, nor is it that which is ultimately \n1 'Urn so ausdriicklicher muss mit der existenzialen Begriffsbestimmung die existen\u00b7 \nzielle Unverbindlichkeit zusammengehen . .  .' \n"

On the contrary, if Dasein exists, \nit has already been thrown into this possibility. Dasein does not, proximally \nand for the most part, have any explicit or even any theoretical knowledge \nof the fact that it has been delivered over to its death, and that death thus \nbelongs to Being-in-the-world. Thrownness into death reveals itself to \nDasein in a more primordial and impressive manner in that state-of-mind \nwhich we have called \"anxiety\". viii Anxiety in the face of death is anxiety \n'in the face of' that potentiality-for-Being which is one's ownmost, non\u00ad\nrelational, and not to be outstripped. That in the face of which one has \nanxiety is Being-in-the-world itself. That about which one has this anxiety \nis simply Dasein's potentiality-for-Being. Anxiety in the face of death \nmust not be confused with fear in the face of one's demise. This anxiety \nis not an accidental or random mood of 'weakness' in some individual ; \nbut, as a basic state-of-mind of Dasein, it amounts to the disclosedness of \nthe fact that Dasein exists as thrown Being towards its end. Thus the \nexistential conception of \"dying\" is made clear as thrown Being towards \nits ownmost potentiality-for-Being, which is non-relational and not to be \noutstripped. Precision is gained by distinguishing this from pure dis\u00ad\nappearance, and also from merely perishing, and finally from the 'Experi\u00ad\nencing' of a demise.l \nBeing-towards-the-end does not first arise through some attitude which \noccasionally emerges, nor does it arise as such an attitude ; it belongs \nessentially to Dasein's thrownness, which reveals itself in a state-of-mind \n(mood) in one way or another. The factical 'knowledge' or 'ignorance' \nwhich prevails in any Dasein as to its ownmost' Being-towards-the-end, is \nonly the expression of the existentiell possibility that there are different \nways of maintaining oneself in this Being. Factically, there are many who, \nproximally and for the most part, do not know about death; but this must \nnot be passed off as a ground for proving that Being-towards-death does not \nbelong to Dasein 'universally'. It only proves that proximally and for the \nmost part Dasein covers up its ownmost Being-towards-death, fleeing in \nthe face of it. Factically, Dasein is dying as long as it exists, but proximally \nand for the most part, it does so by way ofjalling. For factical existing is \n252 \nnot only generally and without further differentiation a thrown poten\u00ad\ntiality-for-Being-in-the-world, but it has always likewise been absorbed in \nthe 'world' of its concern.

The foundation of any interpretation \nis an act of understanding, which is always accompanied by a state-of\u00ad\nmind, or, in other words, which has a mood. So we must ask how Being\u00ad\ntowards-death is disclosed by the kind of understanding which, with its \nstate-of-mind, lurks in the idle talk , of the \"they\". How does the \"they\" \ncomport itself understandingly towards that ownmost possibility ofDasein, \nwhich is non-relational and is not to be outstripped ? What state-of-mind \ndiscloses to the \"they\" that it has been delivered over to death, and in \nwhat way? \nIn the publicness with which we are with one another in our everyday \nmanner, death is 'known' as a mishap which is constantly occurring-as \n253 \na 'case of death'. 3 Someone or other 'dies', be he neighbour or stranger \n1 '0 \n0 0 dann muss es auch-wenngleich zunachst uneigentlich-in der Alltaglichkeit \naufweisbar seino' The earlier editions have another 'auch' just before 'in der Alltaglichkeit'o \n2 'o .\n. das sich in der iiffentlichen Ausgelegtheit konstituiert, die sich im Gerede auss\u00ad\nprichto' The earlier editions have ' \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n konstituiert.

The \"they\" \nhas already stowed away [gesichert] an interpretation for this event. It \ntalks of it in a 'fugitive' manner, either expressly or else in a way which is \nmostly inhibited, as if to say, \"One of these days one will die too, in the \nend ; but right now it has nothing to do with us.\"l \nThe analysis of the phrase 'one dies' reveals unambiguously the kind \nof Being which belongs to everyday Being-towards-death. In such a way \nof talking, death is understood as an indefinite something which, above all, \nmust duly arrive from somewhere or other, but which is proximally not \nyet present-at-hand for oneself, and is therefore no threat. The expression \n'one dies' spreads abroad the opinion that what gets reached, as it were, \nby death, is the \"they\". In Dasein's public way of interpreting, it is said \nthat 'one dies', because everyone else and oneself can talk himself into \nsaying that \"in no case is it I myself\", for this \"one\" is the \"nobody\".2 \n'Dying' is levelled off to an occurrence which reaches Dasein, to be sure, \nbut belongs to nobody in particular. If idle talk is always ambiguous, so \nis this manner of talking about death. Dying, which is essentially mine \nin such a way that no one can be my representative, is perverted into an \nevent of public occurrence which the \"they\" encounters. In the way of \ntalking which we have characterized, death is spoken of as a 'case' which \nis constantly occurring. Death gets passed off as always something 'actual' ;  \nits character as a possibility gets concealed, and so are the other two \nitems that belong to it-the fact that it is non-relational and that it is not \nto be outstripped. By such ambiguity, Dasein puts itself in the position \nof losing itself in the \"they\" as regards a distinctive potentiality-for-Being \nwhich belongs to Dasein's ownmost Self. The \"they\" gives its approval, \nand aggravates the temptation to cover up from oneself one's ownmost \nBeing-towards-death.xl \nThis evasive concealment in the face of death \ndominates everydayness so stubbornly that, in Being with one another, the \n'neighbours' often still keep talking the 'dying person' into the belief that \nhe will escape death and soon return to the tranquillized everydayness of \nthe world of his concern. Such 'solicitude' is meant to 'console' him. It \ninsists upon bringing him back into Dasein, while in addition it helps him \n1 ' . . .  man stirbt am Ende auch einmal, aber zunachst bleibt man selbst unbetroffen.' \n2 'Die iiffentliche Daseinsauslegung sagt: \"man stirbt\", weil damit jeder andere und \nman selbst sich einreden kann : je nicht gerade ich ; denn dieses Man ist das Niemand.' \nWhile we have usually followed the convention of translating the indefinite pronoun \n'man' as 'one' and the expression 'das Man' as 'the \"they\" ', to do so here would obscure \nthe point. \n"

Everyday Being-towards-the-end, and the Full Existential Conception of \nDeath \nIn our preliminary existential sketch, Being-towards-the-end has been \ndefined as Being towards one's ownmost potentiality-for-Being, which is \nnon-relational and is not to be outstripped. Being towards this possibility, \nas a Being which exists, is brought face to face with the absolute impos\u00ad\nsibility of existence. Beyond this seemingly empty characterization of \nBeing-towards-death, there has been revealed the concretion of this Being \nin the mode of everydayness. In accordance with the tendency to falling, \nwhich is essential to everydayness, Being-towards-death has turned out to \nbe an evasion in the face of death-an evasion which conceals. While our \ninvestigation has hitherto passed from a formal sketch of the ontological \nstructure of death to the concrete analysis of everyday Being-towards-the\u00ad\nend, the direction is now to be reversed, and we shall arrive at the full \nexistential conception of death by rounding out our Interpretation of \neveryday Being-towards-the-end. \nIn explicating everyday Being-towards-death we have clung to the idle \ntalk of the \"they\" to the effect that \"one dies too, sometime, but not right \naway.\"2 All that we have Interpreted thus far is the 'one dies' as such. In \nthe 'sometime, but not right away', everydayness concedes something like \na certainty of death. Nobody doubts that one dies. On the other hand, this \n'not doubting' need no\u00e7 imply that kind of Being-certain which corre\u00ad\nsponds to the way death-in the sense of the distinctive possibility char\u00ad\nacterized above-enters into Dasein. Everydayness confines itself to \n1 ' .\n.\n\u2022\n wenn auch nur im Modus des Besorgens einer unbehelligten Gleichgiiltigkeit gegen die \niiusserste M oglichkeit seiner Existenz.' Ordinarily the expression 'Gleichgiiltigkeit gegen' \nmeans simply 'indifference towards'. But Heidegger's use of boldface type suggests that \nhere he also has in mind that 'gegen' may mean 'against' or 'in opposition to'. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 man stirbt aucb einmal, aber vorlaufig noch nicht.' \n"

What are \nwe to say about the 'certainty of death' ? \nTo be certain of an entity means to hold it for true as something true.1 \nBut \"truth\" signifies the uncoveredness of some entity, and all uncovered\u00ad\nness is grounded ontologically in the most primordial truth, the disclosed\u00ad\nness ofDasein.xtv As an entity which is both disclosed and disclosing, and \none which uncovers, Dasein is essentially 'in the truth'. But certainry is \ngrounded in the truth, or belongs to it equiprimordially. The expression 'certainty', \nlike the term 'truth', has a double signification. Primordially \"truth\" \nmeans the same as \"Being-disclosive\", as a way in which Dasein behaves. \nFrom this comes the derivative signification: \"the uncoveredness of \nentities\". Correspondingly, \"certainty\", in its primordial signification, is \ntantamount to \"Being-certain\", as a kind of Being which belongs to \nDasein. However, in a derivative signification, any entity of which \nDasein can be certain will also get called something 'certain'. \nOne mode of certainty is conviction. In conviction, Dasein lets the testi\u00ad\nmony of the thing itself which has been uncovered (the true thing itself) \nbe the sole determinant for its Being towards that thing understandingly. 2 \nHolding something for true is adequate as a way of maintaining oneself \nin the truth, if it is grounded in the uncovered entity itself, and if, as \nBeing towards the entity so uncovered, it has become transparent to itself \nas regards its appropriateness to that entity. In any arbitrary fiction or in \nmerely having some 'view' [\"Ansicht\"] about an entity, this sort of thing \nis lacking. \nThe adequacy of holding-for-true is measured according to the truth\u00ad\nclaim to which it belongs. Such a claim gets its justification from the kind \nof Being of the entity to be disclosed, and from the direction of the dis\u00ad\nclosure. The kind of truth, and along with it, the certainty, varies with \nthe way entities differ, and accords with the guiding tendency and extent \nof the disclosure. Our present considerations will be restricted to an \n1 'Eines Seienden gewiss-sein besagt : es als wahres ftir wahr halten.' The earlier editions \nhave 'Gewisssein' instead of 'gewiss-sein'. Our literal but rather unidiomatic translation \nof the phrase 'ftir wahr hal ten' seems desirable in view of Heidegger's extensive use of the \nverb 'halten' ('hold') in subsequent passages where this phrase occurs, though this is \no_bscured br o\u00d8 \u00d9anslatin\u00da 'hot;n sich i\u00db \n\u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ' as 'maintain itself in \u2022\n\u2022\n .' and 'halten \ns1ch an . . \u2022 as clmg to . . . or suck to .\n.\n.\n\u2022\n \nll 'In ihr llisst sich das Dasein einzig durch das Zeugnis der entdeckten (wahre) Sache \nselbst sein verstehendes Sein zu dieser bestimmen.'

In \nconcernfully Being out for something possible, there is a tendency to \nannihilate the possibility of the possible by making it available to us. But the \nconcernful actualization of equipment which is ready-to-hand (as in \nproducing it, getting it ready, readjusting it, and so on) is always merely \nrelative, since even that which has been actualized is still characterized \nin terms of some involvements-indeed this is precisely what characterizes \nits Being. Even though actualized, it remains, as actual, something pos-\nsible for doing something; it is characterized by an \"in-order-to\".

For one \nthing, death as possible is not something possible which is ready-to-hand \nor present-at-hand, but a possibility of Dasein's Being. So to concern \noneself with actualizing what is thus possible would have to signify, \n\"bringing about one's demise\", But if this were done, Dasein would \ndeprive itself of the very ground for an existing Being-towards-death. \nThus, ifby \"Being towards death\" we do not have in view an 'actuali\u00ad\nzing' of death, neitheX: can we mean \"dwelling upon the end in its pos\u00ad\nsibility\". This is the way one comports oneself when one 'thinks about \ndeath', pondering over when and how this possibility may perhaps be \nactualized. Of course such brooding over death does not fully take away \nfrom it its character as a possibility.

On the other hand, if Being\u00ad\ntowards-death has to disclose understandingly the possibility which we \nhave characterized, and if it is to disclose it as a possibility, then in such \nBeing-towards-death this possibility must not be weakened : it must be \nunderstood as a possibility, it must be cultivated as a possibility, and we must \nput up with it as a possibility, in the way we comport ourselves towards it. \nHowever, Dasein comports itself towards something possible in its \npossibility by expecting it [im Erwarten]. Anyone who is intent on something \n262 \npossible, may encounter it unimpeded and undiminished in its 'whether \nit comes or does not, or whether it comes after all' .1 But with this pheno\u00ad\nmenon of expecting, has not our analysis reached the same kind of Being \ntowards the possible to which we have already called attention in our \ndescription of \"Being out for something\" concernfully? To expect some\u00ad\nthing possible is always to understand it and to 'have' it with regard to \nwhether and when and how it will be actually present-at-hand. Expecting \nis not just an occasional looking-away from the possible to its possible \nactualization, but is essentially a waiting for that actualization [ ein Warten \nauf diese]. Even in expecting, one leaps away from the possible and gets a \nfoothold in the actual. It is for its actuality that what is expected is \nexpected. By the very nature of expecting, the possible is drawn into the \nactual, arising out of the actual and returning to it. 2 \nBut Being towards this possibility, as Being-towards-death, is so to \ncomport ourselves towards death that in this Being, and for it, death \nreveals itself as a possibility. Our terminology for such Being towards this \npossibility is \"anticipation\" of this possibility. 3 But in this way of behaving \ndoes there not lurk a coming-close to the possible, and when one is close \nto the possible, does not its actualization emerge ? In this kind of coming \nclose, however, one does not tend towards concernfully making available \nsomething actual ; but as one comes closer understandingly, the pos\u00ad\nsibility of the possible just becomes 'greater'. The closest closeness which one \nmay have in Being towards death as a possibility, is as far as possible from anything \n1 'Fur ein Gespanntsein auf es vermag ein Mogliches in seinem \"ob oder nicht oder \nschliesslich doch\" ungehindert und ungeschmalert zu begegnen.' \n2 'Auch im Erwarten liegt ein Abspringen vom Moglichen und Fussfasen im Wirk\u00ad\nlichen, dafiir das Erwartete erwartet ist. Vom Wirklichen aus und auf es zu wird das \nMogliche in das Wirkliche erwartungsmasig hereingezogen.' \n3 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n Vorlaufen in die M oglichkeit.' While we have used 'anticipate' to translate 'vor\u00ad\ngreifen', which occurs rather seldom, we shall also use it-les literally-to translate \n'vorlaufen', which appears very often in the following pages, and which has the special \nconnotation of 'running ahead'. But as Heidegger's remarks have indicated, the kind of \n'anticipation' which is involved in Being-towards-death, does not consist in 'waiting for' \ndeath or 'dwelling upon it' or :actualizing' it before it normally comes; nor does \n'running ahead into it' in this se\u02fee mean that we 'rush headlong into it'. \n"

It is \nthe possibility of the impossibility of every way of comporting oneself \ntowards anything, of every way of existing. In the anticipation of this \npossibility it becomes 'greater and greater' ; that is to say, the possibility \nreveals itself to be such that it knows no measure at all, no more or less, \nbut signifies the possibility of the measureless impossibility of existence. \nIn accordance with its essence, this possibility offers no support for \nbecoming intent on something, 'picturing' to oneself the actuality which \nis possible, and so forgetting its possibility. Being-towards-death, as anti\u00ad\ncipation of possibility, is what first makes this possibility possible, and sets \nit free as possibility. \nBeing-towards-death is the anticipation of a potentiality-for-Being of \nthat entity whose kind of Being is anticipation itself. 1 In the anticipatory \nrevealing of this potentiality-for-Being, Dasein discloses itself to itself as \nregards its uttermost possibility.

Being towards this possibility dis\u00ad\ncloses to Dasein its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, in which its very Being is \nthe issue. Here it can become manifest to Dasein that in this distinctive \npossibility of its own self, it has been wrenched away from the \"they\". \nThis means that in anticipation any Dasein can have wrenched itself away \nfrom the \"they\" already.

Death does not just 'belong' \nto one's own Dasein in an undifferentiated way; death lays claim to it as \nan individual Dasein. The non-relational character of death, as understood \nin anticipation, individualizes Dasein down to itself. This individualizing \nis a way in which the 'there' is disclosed for existence. It makes xnanifest \nthat all Being-alongside the things with which we concern ourselves, and \nal Being-with Others, will fail us when our ownmost potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing is the issue. Dasein .can be authentically itself only if it xnakes this \npossible for itself of its own accord. But if concern and solicitude fail us, \nthis does not signify at al that these ways of Dasein have been cut off \nfrom its authentically Being-its-Self. As structures essential to Dasein's \nconstitution, these have a share in conditioning the possibility of any \nexistence whatsoever. Dasein is authentically itself only to the extent that, \nas concernful Being-alongside and solicitous Being-with, it projects itself \nupon its ownmost potentiality-for-Being rather than upon the possibility \nofthe they-self.

Being \ntowards this possibility enables Dasein to understand that giving itself up \nimpends for it as the uttermost possibility of its existence. Anticipation, \nhowever, unlike inauthentic Being-towards-death, does not evade the \nfact that death is not to be outstripped; instead, anticipation frees itself \nfor accepting this. When, by anticipation, one becomes free for one's own \ndeath, one is liberated from one's lostness in those possibilities which may \naccidentally thrust theonselves upon one ; and one is liberated in such a \nway that for the first time one can authentically understand and choose \namong the factical possibilities lying ahead of that possibility which is \nnot to be outstripped.1 Anticipation discloses to existence that its utter\u00ad\nmost possibility lies in giving itself up, and thus it shatters all one's tena\u00ad\nciousness to whatever existence one has reached. In anticipation, Dasein \nguards itself anainst falling back behind itself, or behind the potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being which it has understood. It guards itself against 'becoming too \nold for its victories' (Nietzsche) . Free for its ownmost possibilities, which \nare determined by the end and so are understood as finite [endliche], Dasein \ndispels the danger that it may, by its own finite understanding of existence, \nfail to recognize that it is getting outstripped by the existence-possibilities \nof Others, or rather that it may explain these possibilities wrongly and \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n die der uniiberholbaren vorgelagert sind.'

Dasein's mood brings it face to face with the \nthrownness of its 'that it is there' ,xi.X But the state-of-mind which can hold \nopen the utter and constant threat to itself arising from Dasein' s ownmost individual-\n266 \ni.{.ed Being, is anxiety.xx 1 In this state-of-mind, Dasein finds itself face to face \nwith the \"nothing\" of the possible impossibility of its existence. Anxiety \nis anxious about the potentiality-for-Being of the entity so destined [des so \nbestimmten Seienden], and in this way it discloses the uttermost pos\u00ad\nsibility. Anticipation utterly individualizes Dasein, and allows it, in this \nindividualization of itself, to become certain of the totality of its potenti\u00ad\nality-for-Being. For this reason, anxiety as a basic state-of-mind belongs \nto such a self-understanding of Dasein on the basis of Dasein itself. 2 \nBeing-towards-death is essentially anxiety. This is attested unmistakably, \nthough 'only' indirectly, by Being-towards-death as we have described it, \n1 'Die Bejindlichlr.eit-aber, welche die stiindige und schlechthinnige, aus dem eigensten vereinzelten \nSein des Dasiens aufsteigende Bedrohung seiner selbst offen zu halten vermag, ist die Angst.' Notice \nthat 'welche' may be construed either as the subject or as the direct object of the relative \nclause. \n2 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n gehort zu diesem Sichverstehen des Daseins a us seinem Grunde die Gnmd-. \nbefindlichkeit der Angst.' It is not grammatically clear whether 'seinem' refers to \u00b7s,ch\u00ad\nverstehen' or to 'Daseins'. \n"

The existen\u00ad\ntial projection in which anticipation has been delimited, has made visible \nthe ontological possibility of an existentiell Being-towards-death which is \nauthentic. Therewith, however, the possibility of Dasein's having an \nauthentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole emerges, but only as an ontological \npossibility. In our existential projection of anticipation, we have of course \nclung to those structures of Dasein which we have arrived at earlier, and \nwe have, as it were, let Dasein itself project itself upon this possibility, \nwithout holding up to Dasein an ideal of existence with any special 'con\u00ad\ntent', or forcing any such ideal upon it 'from outside'. Nevertheless, this \nexistentially 'possible' Being-towards-death remains, from the existentiell \npoint of view, a fantastical exaction. The fact that an authentic potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being-a-whole is ontologically possible for Dasein, signifies nothing, so \nlong as a corresponding ontical potentiality-for-Being has not been demon\u00ad\nstrated in Dasein itself. Does Dasein ever factically throw itself into such \na Being-towards-death ? Does Dasein demand, even by reason of its own\u00ad\nmostBeing, an authentic potentiality-for-Being determined by anticipation? \nBefore answering these questions, we must investigate whether to any \n267 \nextent and in anyway Dasein gives testimony, from its ownmost potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being, as to a possible authenticity of its existence, so that it not only \nmakes known that in an existentiell manner such authenticity is possible, \nbut demands this of itself. \nThe question of Dasein's authentic Being-a-whole and of its existential \nconstitution still hangs in mid-air. It can be put on a phenomenal basis \nwhich will stand the test only if it can cling to a possible authenticity of \nits Being which is attested by Dasein itself. If we succeed in uncovering \nthat attestation phenomenologically, together with what it attests, then \nthe problem will arise anew as to whether the anticipation of [zum] death, \nwhich we have hitherto projected only in its ontological possibility, has an essential \nconnection with that authentic potentiality-for-Being which has been attested. \n"

This perversion, however, is one that is shared by every \n\"superior\" criticism in which conscience is taken as something just \noccurring from time to time rather than as a 'universally established and \nascertainable fact'. Among such proofs and counterproofs, the Fact of \nconscience cannot present itself at all. This is no lack in it, but merely a \nsign by which we can recognize it as ontologically of a different kind from \nwhat is environmentally present-at-hand. \nConscience gives us 'something' to understand; it discloses. By \ncharacterizing this phenomenon formally in this way, we find ourselves \nenjoined to take it back into the disclosedness of Dasein. This disclosedness, \nas a basic state of that entity which we ourselves are, is constituted by \nstate-of-mind, understanding, falling, and discourse. If we analyse con\u00ad\nscience more penetratingly, it is revealed as a call [RuJJ. Calling is a mode \nof discourse. The call of conscience has the character of an appeal to Dasein \nby calling it to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self; and this is \ndone by way of summoning it to its ownmost Being-guilty.1 \nThis existential Interpretation is necessarily a far cry from everyday \nontical common sense, though it sets forth the ontological foundations of \nwhat the ordinary way of interpreting conscience has always understood \nwithin certain limits and has conceptualized as a 'theory' of conscience. \nAccordingly our existential Interpretation needs to be confirmed by a \ncritique of the way in which conscience is ordinarily interpreted. When \nthis phenomenon has been exhibited, we can bring out the extent to which \nit attests an authentic potentiality-for-Being of Dasein. To the call of \n270 \nconscience there corresponds a possible hearing. Our understanding of \nthe appeal unveils itself as our wanting to have a conscience [Gewissenhaben\u00ad\nwollen]. But in this phenomenon lies that existentiell choosing which we \nseek-the choosing to choose a kind of Being-one's-Selfwhich, in accord\u00ad\nance with its existential structure, we call \"resoluteness\". 2 Thus we can see \nhow the analyses of this chapter are divided up: the existential-onto-\n1 'Der Gewissensruf hat den Charakter des Anrufs des Daseins auf sein eigenstes Selb\u00ad\nstseinkonnen und das in der Weise des Aufrufs zum eigensten Schuldigsein.' Our transla\u00ad\ntion of 'Anruf' as 'appeal' and of 'Aufruf' as 'summoning' conceals the etymological \nconnection of these expressions with 'Ruf', which we here translate as 'call'-a word which \nwe have already used in translating expressions such as 'nennen', 'heissen', and a number \nof others. The verb 'anrufen' ('appeal') means literally 'to call to' ; 'einen auf etwas \nanrufen' means 'to call to someone and call him to something'. Similarly 'aujrufen' \n('summon') means 'to call up' ; 'einen zu etwas aufrufen' means 'to call someone up to \nsomething which he is to do', in the sense of challenging him or 'calling' him to a higher \nlevel of performance. \n11 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n das gesuchte existenzielle Wahlen der Wahl cines Se!bstseins, das wir, seiner \nexistentialen Struktur entsprechend, die Entschlossenheit nennen.' While our version \npreserves the grammatical ambiguity of the German, it seems clear from H. 298 that the \nantecedent of the second relative clause is 'Selbstsein' ('a kind of Being-one's-self'), not \n'Wahlen' ('choosing'). \n"

Our analysis \nof it takes its departure from this finding. Conscience discloses, and thus \nbelongs within the range of those existential phenomena which constitute \nthe Being of the \"there\" as disclosedness.tv We have analysed the most \nuniversal structures of state-of-mind, understanding, discourse and falling. \nIf we now bring conscience into this phenomenal context, this is not a \nmatter of applying these structures schematically to a special 'case' of \nDasein's disclosure. On the contrary, our Interpretation of conscience not \nonly will carry further our earlier analysis of the disclosedness of the \n\"there\", but it will also grasp it more primordially with regard to \nDasein's authentic Being. \nThrough disclosedness, that entity which we call \"Dasein\" is in the \npossibility of being its \"there\". With its world, it is there for itself, and \nindeed-proximally and for the most part-in such a way that it has \ndisclosed to itself its potentiality-for-Being in terms of the 'world' of its \nconcern. Dasein exists as a potentiality-for-Being which has, in each case, \nalready abandoned itself to definite possibilities.1 And it has abandoned \nitself to these possibilities because it is an entity which has been thrown, \nand an entity whose thrownness gets disclosed more or less plainly and \nimpressively by its having a mood. To any state-of-mind or mood, under\u00ad\nstanding belongs equiprimordially. In this way Dasein 'knows' what it is \nitself capable of [woran es mit ihm selbst ist], inasmuch as it has either \nprojected itself upon possibilities of its own or has been so absorbed in the \n\"they\" that it has let such possibilities be presented to it by the way in \nwhich the \"they\" has publicly interpreted things. The presenting of these \npossibilities, however, is made possible existentially through the fact \nthat Dasein, as a Being-with which understands, can listen to Others. \n27 1 \nLosing itself in the publicness and the idle talk of the \"they\", it fails to hear \n[uberhort] its own Self in listening to the they-self. If Dasein is to be able \nto get brought back from this lostness of failing to hear itself, and if this \nis to be done through itself, then it must first be able to find itself-to find \n1 'Das Seinkonnen, als welches das Dasein existiert, hat sich je schon bestimmten \nMoglichkeiten iiberlassen.' \n"

If in \nthis lost hearing, one has been fascinated with the 'hubbub' of the manifold \nambiguity which idle talk possesses in its everyday 'newness', then the call \nmust do its calling without any hubbub and unambiguously, leaving \nno foothold for curiosity. That which, by calling in this manner, gives us to \nunderstand, is the conscience. \nWe take calling as a mode of discourse. Discourse articulates \nintelligibility. Characterizing conscience as a call is not just giving a \n'picture', like the Kantian representation of the conscience as a court of \njustice. Vocal utterance, however, is not essential for discourse, and there\u00ad\nfore not for the call either ; this must not be overlooked. Discourse is \nalready presupposed in any expressing or 'proclaiming' [\"Ausrufen\"]. \nIf the everyday interpretation knows a 'voice' of conscience, then one is \nnot so much thinking of an utterance (for this is something which facti\u00ad\ncally one never comes across) ; the 'voice' is taken rather as a giving-to\u00ad\nunderstand. In the tendency to disclosure which belongs to the call, lies \nthe momentum of a push-of an abrupt arousal. The call is from afar unto \nafar. It reaches him who wants to be brought back. \nBut by this characterization of the conscience we have only traced the \nphenomenal horizon for analysing ,its existential structure. We are not \n1 ' .\n\u2022\n.\n sich selbst, das sich iiberhort hat und iiberhort im Hinhiiren auf das Man.' In this \npassage, Heidegger has been exploiting three variations on the verb 'horen': 'horen auf . \u2022  .' \n(our 'listen to . .  .'), 'iiberhoren' ('fail to hear'), and 'hinhoren' ('listen away'). The \nverb 'iiberhoren' has two quite distinct uses. It may mean the 'hearing' which a teacher \ndoes when he 'hears' a pupil recite his lesson; but it may also mean to 'fail to hear', even \nto 'ignore' what one hears. This is the meaning which Heidegger seems to have uppermost \nin mind; but perhaps he is also suggesting that when one is lost in the \"they\", one 'hears' \none's own Self only in the manner of a perfunctory teacher who 'hears' a recitation with\u00ad\nout 'really lisfening to it'. In ordinary German the verb 'hinhoren' means hardly more \nthan to 'listen' ; but Heidegger is emphasizing the prefix 'hin-', which suggests that one is \nlistening to something other than oneself-listening away, in this case listening to the \n\"they\". On other verbs of hearing and listening, see Section 34 above, especially H. 163 ff. \n2 'Dieses Hinhoren muss gebrochen, das heisst es muss vom Dasein selbst die Moglich\u00ad\nkeit eines Horens gegeben werden, das jenes unterbricht.' \n8 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n zum verlorenen Horen . . .

In considering this we have from the beginning avoided \nthe first route which offers itself for an Interpretation of conscience \n-that of tracing it back to some psychical faculty such as under\u00ad\nstanding, will, or feeling, or of explaining it as some sort of mixture of \nthese. When one is confronted with such a phenomenon as conscience, \none is str.uck by the ontologico-anthropological inadequacy of a free-floating \n2 72 \nframework of psychical faculties or personal actions all duly classified.vi \n\u0282 56. The Character of Conscience as a Call \nTo any discourse there belongs that which is talked about in it. Dis\u00ad\ncourse gives information about something, and does so in some definite \nregard. From what is thus talked about, it draws whatever it is saying as \nthis particular discourse-what is said in the talk as such. In discourse as \ncommunication, this becomes accessible to the Dasein-with of Others, \nfor the most part by way of uttering it in language. \nIn the call of conscience, what is it that is talked about-in other words, \nto what is the appeal made ? Manifestly Dasein itself. This answer is as \nincontestable as it is indefinite. If the call has so vague a target, then it \nmight at most remain an occasion for Dasein to pay attention to itself. \nBut it is essential to Dasein that along with the disclosedness of its world \nit has been disclosed to itself, so that it always understands itself. The call \nreaches Dasein in this understanding of itself which it always has, and \nwhich is concernful in an everyday, average manner. The call reaches \nthe they-self of concernful Being with Others. \nAnd to what is one called when one is thus appealed to ?1 To one's \n273 \nown Self. Not to what Dasein counts-fer, can do, or concerns itself with in \nbeing with one another publicly, nor to what it has taken hold of, set \nabout, or let itself be carried along with. The sort of Dasein which is \nunderstood after the manner of the 'world both for Others and for itself, \ngets passed over in this appeal; this is something of which the call to the \nSelf takes not the slightest cognizance. And because only the Self of the \nthey-self gets appealed to and brought to hear, the \"they\" collapses. But \nthe fact that the call passes over both the \"they\" and the manner in which \nDasein has been publicly interpreted, does not by any means signify that \nthe \"they\" is not reached too. Precisely in passing over the \"they\" (keen as it \nis for public repute) the call pushes it into insignificance [Bedeutungs\u00ad\nlosigkeit]. But the Self, which the appeal has robbed of this lodgement \nand hiding-place, gets brought to itself by the call. \n1 'Und woraufhin wird es angerufen?' \n"

The call passes over \neverything like this and disperses it, so as to appeal solely to that Self \nwhich, notwithstanding, is in no other way than Being-in-the-world. \nBut how are we to determine what is said in the talk that belongs to this \nkind of discourse? What does the conscience call to him to whom it appeals ? \nTaken strictly, nothing. The call asserts nothing, gives no information \nabout world-events, has nothing to tell. Least of all does it try to set going \na 'soliloquy' in the Self to which it has appealed. 'Nothing' gets called to \n[\u00dbu-gerufen] this Self, but it has been summoned [azifgeruftn] to itself-that \nis, to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. The tendency of the call is not \nsuch as to put up for 'trial' the Self to which the appeal is made; but it \ncalls Dasein forth (and 'forward') into its ownmost possibilities, as a \nsummons to its ownmost potentialiry-for-Being-its-Self. 2 \nThe call dispenses with any kind of utterance. It does not put itself \ninto words at all; yet it remains nothing less than obscure and indefinite. \nConscience_ discourses solely and constantly in the mode of keeping silent. In this \nway it not only loses none of its perceptibility, but forces the Dasein which \nhas been appealed to and summoned, into the reticence of itself. The fact \n274 \nthat what is called in the call has not been formulated in words, does not \ngive this phenomenon the indefiniteness of a mysterious voice, but merely \nindicates that our understanding of what is 'called' is not to be tied up \nwith an expectation of anything like a communication. \nYet what the call discloses is unequivocal, even though it may undergo \na different interpretation in the individual Dasein in accordance with its \nown possibilities of understanding. While the content of the call is seem\u00ad\ningly indefinite, the direction it takes is a sure one and is not to be over\u00ad\nlooked. The cal does not require us to search gropingly for him to whom \nit appeals, nor does it require any sign by which we can recognize that he \nis or is not the one who is meant. When 'delusions' arise in the conscience, \nthey do so not because the call has committed some oversight (has mis\u00ad\ncalled),3 but only because the call gets heard in such a way that instead of \n1 'Aufdas Selbst wird das Man-selbst angerufen.' \nz 'Der Ruf stellt, seiner Ruftendenz entsprechend, das angerufene Selbst nicht zu einer \n\"Verhandlung\", sondern als Aufruf zum eigensten Selbstseinkonnen ist er ein Vor-(nach\u00ad\n\"vorne\"-)Rufen des Daseins in seine eigensten Moglichkeiten.'

Understanding the Appeal, and Guilt \nTo grasp phenomenally what one hears in understanding the appeal, \nwe must go back to the appeal anew. The appeal to the they-self signifies \nsumoning one's ownmost Self to its potentiality-for-Being, and of course \nas Dasein-that is, as concernful Being-in-the-world and Being with \nOthers. Thus in Interpreting existentially that towards which the call \nsumons us, we cannot seek to delimit any concrete single possibility of \nexistence as long as we correctly understand the methodological possibili\u00ad\nties and tasks which such an Interpretation implies. That which can be \nestablished, and which seeks to be established, is not what gets called in \nand to each particular Dasein from an existentiell standpoint, but is \nrather what belongs to the existential condition for the possibility of its factical\u00ad\nexistentiell potentiality-for-Being.\u2022 \nWhen the call is understood with an existentiell kind of hearing, such \nunderstanding is more authentic the more non-relationally Dasein hears \nand understands its own Being-appealed-to, and the less the meaning of \nthe call gets perverted by what one says or by what is fitting and accepted \n[was sich gehOrt und gilt].

The call points forward to Dasein's potentiality-for-Being, \nand it does this as a call which comes from uncanniness. 3 The caller is, \nto be sure, indefinite; but the \"whence\" from which it calls does not \nremain a matter of indifference for the caling.

What has been called must first be concep\u00ad\ntualized if we are to understand what the call of'Guilty!' means, and why \nand how it becomes perverted in its signification by the everyday way of \ninterpreting it. \nEveryday common sense first takes 'Being-guilty' in the sense of 'owing', \nof 'having something due on account'.1 One is to give back to the Other \nsomething to which the latter has a claim. This 'Being-guilty' as 'having \ndebts' [\"Schulden haben\"] is a way of Being with Others in the field of \nconcern, as in providing something or bringing it along. Other modes of \nsuch concern are: depriving, borrowing, withholding, taking, stealing\u00ad\nfailing to satisfy, in some way or other, the claims which Others have \nmade as to their possessions. This kind of Being-guilty is related to \n282 \nthat with which one can concern oneself. \n\"Being-guilty\" also has the signification of 'being responsible for' [\"schuld \nsein an\"]-that is, being the cause or author of something, or even 'being \nthe occasion' for something. In this sense of 'having responsibility' for \nsomething, one can 'be guilty' of something without 'owing' anything to \nsomeone else or coming to 'owe' him. On the other hand, one can owe \nsomething to another without being responsible for it oneself. Another \nperson can 'incur debts' with Others 'for me'. 2 \nThese ordinary significations of \"Being-guilty\" as 'having debts to \nsomeone' and 'having responsibility for something' can go together and \ndefine a kind of behaviour which we call 'making oneself responsible' ; that is, \nby having the responsibility for having a debt, one may break a law and \nmake oneself punishable. 3 Yet the requirement which one fails to satisfy \nneed not necessarily be related to anyone's possessions; it can regulate \nthe very manner in which we are with one other publicly. 'Making oneself \nresponsible' by breaking a law, as we have thus defined it, can indeed also \nhave the character of 'coming to owe something to Others'. 4 This does not \nhappen merely through law-breaking as such, but rather through my \nhaving the responsibility for the Other's becoming endangered in his \nexistence, led astray, or even ruined. This way of coming to owe something \n1 'Die alltagliche Verstandigkeit nirnmt das \"Schuldigsein\" zunachst im Sinne von \n\"schulden\", \"bei einem etwas an Brett haben\".' While this represents a very familiar \nusage of the German 'Schuldigsein', it of course does not represent a 'common-sense' usage \nof the English 'Being-guilty', which comes from an entirely different stern. \n2 'lrn Sinne dieses \"Schuld habens\" an etwas kann man \"schuldig sein\", ohne einem \nAndern etwas zu \"schulden\" oder \"schuldig\" zu werden. Urngekehrt kann man einem \nAndern etwas schulden, ohne selbst schuld daran zu sein. Ein Anderer kann bei Anderen \n\"fur rnich\" \"Schulden machen\".'

Thus the formal \nconception of\"Being-guilty\" in the sense of having come to owe something \nto an Other, may be defined as follows : \"Being-the-basis for a lack of some\u00ad\nthing in the Dasein of an Other, and in such a manner that this very \nBeing-the-basis determines itself as 'lacking in some way' in terms of that \nfor which it is the basis.\"1 This kind of lacking is a failure to satisfy some \nrequirement which applies to one's existent Being with Others. \nWe need not consider how such requirements arise and in what way \ntheir character as requirements and laws must be conceived by reason of \ntheir having such a source. In any case, \"Being-guilty\" in the sense last \nmentioned, the breach of a 'moral requirement', is a kind of Being which \nbelongs to Dasein. Of course this holds good also for \"Being-guilty\" as \n'making oneself punishable' and as 'having debts', and for any 'having \nresponsibility for . . .  '. These too are ways in which Dasein behaves. If \none takes 'laden with moral guilt' as a 'quality' of Dasein, one has said \nvery little. On the contrary, this only makes it manifest that such a char\u00ad\nacterization does not suffice for distinguishing ontologically between this \nkind of 'attribute of Being' for Dasein and those other ways of behaving \nwhich we have just listed. Mter al, the concept of moral guilt has been so \n283 \nlittle clarified ontologically that when the idea of deserving punishment, \nor even of having debts to someone, has also been included in this concept, \nor when these ideas have been employed in the very defining of it, such \ninterpretations of this phenomenon could become prevalent and have \nremained so. But therewith the 'Guilty!' gets thrust aside into the domain \nof concern in the sense of reckoning up claims and balancing them off \nThe phenomenon of guilt, which is not necessarily related to 'having \ndebts' and law-breaking, can be clarified only if we first inquire in prin\u00ad\nciple into Dasein's Being-guilty-in other words, if we conceive the idea \nof 'Guilty!' in terms of Dasein's kind of Being. \nIf this is our goal, the idea of 'Guilty !' must be sufficiently formali;;.ed so \nthat those ordinary phenomena of \"guilt\" which are related to our con\u00ad\ncemful Being with Others, will drop out. The idea of guilt must not \nonly be raised above the domain of that concern in which we reckon \nthings up, but it must also be detached from relationship to any law or \n\"ought\" such that by failing to ,comply with it one loads himself with \nguilt. For here too \"guilt\" is still necessarily defined as a lack-when \nsomething which ought to be and which can be is missing. 9 To be missing, \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n Grundsein flir einen Mangel im Dasein eines Andern, so zwar, das dieses Grund\u00ad\nsein selbst sich aus seinem Woflir als \"mangelhaft\" bestimmt.' \n1 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  auf ein Sollen und Gesetz, wogegen sich verfehlend jemand Schuld auf sich ladt. \nDenn auch bier wird die Schuld notwendig noch als Mangel bestimmt, als Fehlen von \netwas, was sein soU und kan.' \n"

In this sense it is essential that in \nexistence there can be nothing lacking, not because it would then be \nperfect, but because its character of Being remains distinct from any \npresence-at-hand. \nNevertheless, in the idea of'Guilty !' there lies the character of the \"not\". \nIf the 'Guilty!' is something that can definitely apply to existence, then \nthis raises the ontological problem of clarifying existentially the character \nof this \"not\" as a \"not\". Moreover, to the idea of 'Guilty !' belongs what \nis expressed without further differentiation in the conception of guilt as \n'having responsibility for'-that is, as Being-the basis for .\n.\n\u2022\n Hence we \ndefine the formally existential idea of the 'Guilty !' as \"Being-the-basis \nfor a Being which has been defined by a 'not' \"-that is to say, as \"Being\u00ad\nthe-basis of a nulliry\" \u20221 The idea of the \"not\" which lies in the concept of \nguilt as understood existentially, excludes relatedness to anything present\u00ad\nat-hand which is possible or which may have been required; furthermore, \nDasein is altogether incommensurable with anything present-at-hand or \ngenerally accepted [Geltenden] which is not it itself, or which is not in \nthe way Dasein is-namely, existing; so any possibility that, with regard to \nBeing-the-basis for a lack, the entity which is itself such a basis might be \nreckoned up as 'lacking in some manner', is a possibility which drops out. \nIf a lack, such as failure to fulfil some requirement, has been 'caused' in \na manner characteristic of Dasein, we cannot simply reckon back to there \n284 \nbeing something lacking [Mangelhaftigkeit] in the 'cause'. Being-the-basis\u00ad\nfor-something need not have the same \"not\"-character as the privativum \nwhich is based upon it and which arises from it. The basis need not \nacquire a nullity of its own from that for which it is the basis [seinem \nBegriindeten]. This implies, however, that Being-guilry does not first \nresult from an indebtedness [Verschuldung], but that, on the contrary, indebtedness \nbecomes possible only 'on the basis' of a primordial Being-guilry. Can something \nlike this be exhibited in Dasein's Being, and how is it at all possible \nexistentially? \nDasein's Being is care. It comprises in itself facticity (thrownness), \nexistence (projection), and falling. As being, Dasein is something that has \nbeen thrown ; it has been brought into its \"there\", but not of its own accord. \nAs being, it has taken the definite form of a potentiality-for-Being which \n1 ' . \n\u2022 \n\u2022 Grundsein f\\ir ein durch ein Nicht bestimmtes Sein-das heisst Gnmdsein einer \nNif:htigkeit'.

It is never existent before its basis, but only from it \nand as this basis. Thus \"Being-a-basis\" means never to have power over \none's ownmost Being from the ground up. This \"not\" belongs to the exis\u00ad\ntential meaning of \"thrownness\". It itself, being a basis, is a nullity of \nitself. 3 \"Nullity\" does not signify anything like not-Being-present-at-hand \nor not-subsisting; what one has in view here is rather a \"not\" which is \nconstitutive for this Being of Dasein-its thrownness. The character of this \n\"not\" as a \"not\" may be defined existentially : in being its Self, Dasein is, \nas a Self, the entity that has been thrown. It has been released from its \nbasis, not through itself but to itself, so as to be as this basis. Dasein is not \nitself the basis of its Being, inasmuch as this basis first arises from its own \nprojection; rather, as Being-its-Self, it is the Being of its basis. 4 This basis \n1 'Seiend ist es als Seinkonnen bestirnmt, das sich selbst gehOrt und doch nicht als es \nselbst sich zu eigen gegeben hat.' It is perhaps tempting to interpret 'gehort' as corning \nfrom the verb 'gehoren' ('belong') rather than 'horen' ('hear') ; we could then read \n'belongs to itself' rather than 'has heard itself'. Our version, however, seems to be favoured \nby the gramar of this pasage. \n2 'Die Geworfenheit aber liegt nicht hinter ihrn als ein tatsachlich vorgefallenes und \nvom Dasein wieder losgefallenes Ereignis, das mit ihm geschah . \u2022 \n' \n8 'Es ist nie existent vor seinem Grunde, sondernje nur aus ihm und a/s dieser. Grundsein \nbesagt demnach, des eigensten Seins von Grund auf nie rnachtig sein. Dieses Nicht gehort \nzum existenzialen Sinn der Geworfenheit. Grund-seiend ist es selbst eine Nichtigkeit \nseiner selbst.' Presumably the 'not' to which Heidegger refers in this puzzling passage, is \nimplied in the 'never' of the preceding sentence. \n4 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n Selbst seiend ist das Dasein das geworfene Seiende als Selbst. Nicht durch es selbst, \nsondern an es selbst ent/assen aus dem Grunde, urn als dieser zu sein. Das Dasein ist nicht \ninsofem selbst der Grund seines Seins, als dieser aus eigenem Entwurf erst entspringt, \nwohl aber ist es als Selbstsein das Sein des Grundes.' \n"

This calling-back in \nwhich conscience calls forth, gives Dasein to understand that Dasein \nitself-the null basis for its null projection, standing in the possibility ofits \nBeing-is to bring itself back to itself from its lostness in the \"they\" ; and \nthis means that it is guilry. \nBut in that case the sort of thing which Dasein gives itself to understand \nwould be information about itself. And the hearing which corresponds to \nsuch a call would be a taking cognizance of the Fact that one is 'guilty'.

Such a \ndemand is not arbitrary, if the call of conscience, coming from Dasein it\u00ad\nself, is directed towards that entity alone. But if so, the \"summons to \nBeing-guilty\" signifies a caling-forth to that potentiality-for-Being which \nin each case I as Dasein am already. Dasein need not first load a 'guilt' \nupon itself through its failures or omissions ; it must only be 'guilty' \nauthentical{r-'guilty' in the way in which it is. 8 \nHearing the appeal correctly is thus tantamount to having an under\u00ad\nstanding of oneself in one's ownmost potentiality-for-Being-that is, to \nprojecting oneself upon one's ownmost authentic potentiality for becoming \n1 We follow the newer editions in reading : ' . . .  ruft es aus der Unheimlichkeit sich \nselbst als faktisch-verfallendes Man auf zu seinem Seinkonnen.'

In understanding the call, Dasein is \nin thrall to [hiirig] its ownmost possibility of existence. It has chosen itself. \n288 \nIn so choosing, Dasein makes possible its ownmost Being-guilty, which \nremains closed off from the they-self. The common sense of the \"they\" \nknows only the satisfying of manipulable rules and public norms and the \nfailure to satisfy them. It reckons up infractions of them and tries to \nbalance them off. It has slunk away from its ownmost Being-guilty so as \nto be able to talk more loudly about making \"mistakes\". But in the appeal, \nthe they-self gets called to [ angerufen] the ownmost Being-guilty of the \nSelf. Understanding the call is choosing ; but it is not a choosing of con\u00ad\nscience, which as such cannot be chosen. What is chosen is having-a\u00ad\nconscience as Being-free for one's ownmost Being-guilty. \"Understanding \nthe appeal\" means \"wanting to have a conscience\". \nThis does not mean that one wants to have a 'good conscience', still \nless that one cultivates the call voluntarily; it means solely that one is \nready to be appealed to. Wanting to have a conscience is just as far from \nseeking out one's factical indebtednesses as it is from the tendency to \nliberation from guilt in the sense of the essential 'guilty'. \nWanting to have a conscience is rather the most primordial existentiell pre\u00ad\nsupposition for the possibility of factically coming to owe something. In under\u00ad\nstanding the call, Dasein lets its ownmost Self take action in itself [in sich \nhandeln] in terms of that potentiality-for-Being which it has chosen. Only \nso can it be answerable [verantwortlich]. Factically, however, any taking\u00ad\naction is necessarily 'conscienceless', not only because it may fail to avoid \nsome factical moral indebtedness, but because, on the null basis of its \nnull projection, it has, in Being with Others, already \u00b7 become guilty \ntowards them. Thus one's wanting-to-have-a-conscience becomes the \ntaking-over of that essential consciencelessness within which alone the \nexistentiell possibility of being 'good' subsists. \nThough the call gives no information, it is not merely critical ; it is \npositive, in that it discloses Dasein's most primordial potentiality-for-Being \nas Being-guilty. Thus conscience manifests itself as an attestation which \nbelongs to Dasein's Being-an attestation in which conscience calls \nDasein itself face to face with its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. Is there \nan existentially more concrete way of determining the character of the \n1 'Schuldigwerdenkonnen'. This 'ownrrwst authentic' sense of 'schuldig werden' is \npresumably to be contrasted with the sense to which we have called attention in notes 2 \nand 4, p. 327, H. 282 above, and which we have expressed by the phrase 'come to owe'. \nWhen it seems to us that Heidegger has the authentic sense in mind, we shall express it by \nthe phrase 'become guilty', though this device exaggerates a contrast which would not \nbe felt so sharply by the German reader. \n"

That the voice gets taken as a \nstirring of conscience which follows after is not enough to prove that we \nunderstand the phenomenon of conscience primordially. What if factical \nindebteqness were only the occasion for the factical calling of conscience? \nWhat if that Interpretation of the 'evil' conscience which we have \ndescribed goes only half way? That such is the case is evident from the \nontological fore-having within whose scope the phenomenon has been \nbrought by this Interpretation. The voice is something that turns up; \nit has its position in the sequence of Experiences which are present-at-\n29 T \nhand, and it follows after the Experience of the deed. But neither the call, \nnor the deed which has happened, nor the guilt with which one is laden, \nis an occurrence with the character of something present-at-hand which \nruns its course. The call has the kind of Being which belongs to care. In \nthe call Dasein 'is' ahead of itself in such a way that at the same time it \ndirects itself back to its thrownness. Only by first positing that Dasein is \nan interconnected sequence of successive Experiences, is it possible to take \nthe voice as something which comes afterwards, something later, which \ntherefore necessarily refers back. The voice does call back, but it calls \nbeyond the deed which has happened, and back to the Being-guilty into \nwhich one has been thrown, which is 'earlier' than any indebtedness. But \nat the same time, this calling-back calls forth to Being-guilty, as something \nto be seized upon in one's own existence, so that authentic existentiell \nBeing-guilty only 'follows after' the call, not vice versa. Bad conscience is \nbasically so far from just reproving and pointing back that it rather points \nforward1 as it calls one back into one's thrownness. The order of the sequence in \nwhich Experiences run their course does not give us the phenomenal structure of existing. \nIf we cannot reach the primordial phenomenon by a characterization \nof 'bad' conscience, still less can we do so by a characterization of 'good' \nconscience, whether we take this as a self-subsistent2 form of conscience \nor as one which is essentially founded upon 'bad' conscience. Just as \nDasein's 'Being-evil' would be made known to us in the 'bad' conscience, \nthe 'good' conscience must have made known its 'Being-good'. It is easy to see \nthat the conscience which used to be an 'effluence of the divine power' now \nbecomes a slave of Pharisaism. Such a conscience would let a man say of \n1 'vorweisend'. We have followed English idiom in translating 'vorweisen' as 'point \nforward' and 'vorrufen' as 'call forth'; but the prefix 'vor-' is the same in both cases, and \nmeans 'forward' as opposed to 'backward'. \n2 'selbstiindige'.

This must be conceded. But does \nthis everyday experience thus give us any guarantee that the full possible \ncontent of the call of the voice of conscience has been heard therein ? \nDoes it follow from this that theories of conscience which are based on the \nordinary way of experiencing it have made certain that their ontological \n293 \nhorizon for analysing this phenomenon is an appropriate one ? Does not \nfalling, which is an essential kind of Being for Dasein, show us rather that \nontically this entity understands itself proximally and for the most part \nin terms of the horizon of concern, but that ontologically, it defines \n\"Being\" in the sense of presence-at-hand ? This, however, leads to cover-\ning up the phenomenon in two ways: what one sees in this theory is a \nsequence of Experiences or 'psychical processes' -a sequence whose kind \nof Being is for the most part wholly indefinite. In such experience the \nconscience is encountered as an arbiter and admonisher, with whom \nDasein reckons and pleads its cause. \nWhen Kant represented the conscience as a 'court of justice' and made \nthis the basic guiding idea in his Interpretation of it, he did not do so by \naccident; this was suggested by the idea of moral law-although his \nconception of morality was far removed from utilitarianism and eudae\u00ad\nmonism. Even the theory of value, whether it is regarded formally or \nmaterially, has as its unexpressed ontological presupposition a 'metaphysic \nofmorals'-that is, an ontology ofDasein and existence. Dasein is regarded \nas an entity with which one might concern oneself, whether this \"concern\" \nhas the sense of 'actualizing values' or of satisfying a norm. \nIf one is to invoke the full range of what the everyday experience of \nconscience-as the only higher court for the Interpretation of conscience\u00ad\nis acquainted with, this cannot be justified unless one has considered \nbeforehand whether the conscience \ncan ever become authentically \naccessible here at all. \nThus the further objection that the existential Interpretation overlooks \nthe fact that the call of conscience always relates itself to some definite \ndeed which has been either 'actualized' or willed, also loses its force. \n1 'Das warnende Gewissen hat die Funktion der momentweisen Regelung eines \nFreibleibens von Verschuldungen.'

The understanding of the appeal is a mode ofDasein's \nBeing, and only as such does it give us the phenomenal content of what the \ncall of conscience attests. The authentic understanding of the call has been \ncharacterized as \"wanting to have a conscience\". This is a way of letting \none's ownmost Self take action in itself of its own accord in its Being\u00ad\nguilty, and represents phenomenally that authentic potentiality-for-Being \nwhich Dasein itself attests. The existential structure of this must now be \nlaid bare. Only so can we proceed to the basic constitution of the authenti\u00ad\nciry of Dasein's existence as disclosed in Dasein itself. \nWanting to have a conscience is, as an understanding of oneself in \none's ownmost potentiality-for-Being, a way in which Dasein has been \ndisclosed. This disclosedness is constituted by discourse and state-of-mind, \nas well as by understanding. To understand in an existentiell manner \nimplies projecting oneself in each case upon one's ownmost factical pos\u00ad\nsibility of having the potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world. But the poten\u00ad\ntialiry-for-Being is understood only by existing in this possibility. \nWhat kind of mood corresponds to such understanding? Understanding \nthe call discloses one's own Dasein in the uncanniness of its individualiza-\n296 \ntion. The uncanniness which is revealed in understanding and revealed \nalong with it, becomes genuinely disclosed by the state-of-mind of anxiety \nwhich belongs to that understanding. The fact of the anxiery of conscience, \ngives us phenomenal confirmation that in understanding the call Dasein \nis brought face to face with its own uncanniness. Wanting-to-have-a\u00ad\nconscience becomes a readiness for anxiety. \nThe third essential item in disclosedness is discourse. The call itself is a \nprimordial kind of discourse for Dasein ; but there is no corresponding \ncounter-discourse in which, let us say, one talks about what the con\u00ad\nscience has said, and pleads one's cause. In hearing the call understand\u00ad\ningly, one denies oneself any counter-discourse, not because one has been \nassailed by some 'obscure power', which suppresses one's hearing, but \nbecause this hearing has appropriated the content of the call uncon\u00ad\ncealedly. In the call one's constant Being-guilty is represented, and in this \nway the Self is brought back from the loud idle talk which goes with the \ncommon sense of the \"they\". Thus the mode of Articulative discourse \nwhich belongs to wanting to have a conscience, is one of reticence. Keeping \nsilent has been characterized as an essential possibility of discourse.lx \nAnyone who keeps silent when he wants to give us to understand some\u00ad\nthing, must 'have something to say'. In the appeal Dasein gives itself to \nunderstand its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. This calling is therefore a \nkeeping-silent. The discourse of the conscience never comes to utterance. \n"

Only in reticence, therefore, is this silent \ndiscourse understood appropriately in wanting to have a conscience. It \ntakes the words away from the common-sense idle talk of the \"they\". \nThe common-sense way of interpreting the conscience, which 'sticks \nrigorously to the facts', takes the silent discourse of the conscience as an \noccasion for passing it off as something which is not at all ascertainable \nor present-at-hand. The fact that \"they\", who hear and understand \nnothing but loud idle talk, cannot 'report' any call, is held against the \nconscience on the subterfuge that it is 'dumb' and manifestly not present\u00ad\nat-hand. With this kind of interpretation the \"they\" merely covers up its \nown failure to hear the call and the fact that its 'hearing' does not reach \nvery far. \nThe disclosedness of Dasein in wanting to have a conscience, is thus \nconstituted by anxiety as state-of-mind, by understanding as a projection \nof oneself upon one's ownmost Being-guilty, and by discourse as reticence. \nThis distinctive and authentic disclosedness, which is attested in Dasein \nitself by its conscience-this reticent self-projection upon one's ownmost Being-\n297 \nguilty, in which one is ready for anxiety-we call \"resoluteness\". \nResoluteness is a distinctive mode of Dasein's disclosedness.1 In an \nearlier passage, however, we have Interpreted disclosedness existentially \nas the primordial truth,x Such truth is primarily not a quality of 'judgment' \nnor of any definite way ofbehaving, but something essentially constitutive \nfor Being-in-the-world as such.

In our ontological clarification of the proposition that 'Dasein \nis in the truth' we have called attention to the primordial disclosedness of \nthis entity as the truth of existence; and for the delimitation of its character \nwe have referred to the analysis of Dasein's authenticity. xi \nIn resoluteness we have now arrived at that truth of Dasein which is \nmost primordial because it is authentic. Whenever a \"there\" is disclosed, \nits whole Being-In-the-world-that is to say, the world, Being-in, and the \nSelf which, as an 'I am', this entity is-is disclosed with equal primord\u00ad\niality. 2 Whenever the world is disclosed, entities within-the-world have \n1 The etymological connection between 'Entschlossenheit' ('resoluteness') and 'Ersch\u00ad\nlossenheit' ('disclosedness') is not to be overlooked. \n2 'Die Erschlossenheit des Da erschliesst gleichurspriinglich das je ganze In-der-Welt\u00ad\nseln das heisst die Welt das In-Sein und das Selbst, das als \"ich bin\" dieses Seiende ist.' \nIt i; not clear grammatically whether 'dieses Seiende' or the pronoun 'das' is the subject \nof the final clause, or whether 'this entity' is 'Dasein' or 'Being-.in'.

In understanding significance, concernful \nDasein submits itself circumspectively to what it encounters as ready\u00ad\nto-hand. Any discovering of a totality of involvements goes back to a \n\"for-the-sake-of-which\" ; and on the understanding of such a \"for-the-sake\u00ad\nof-which\" is based in turn the understanding of significance as the disclosed\u00ad\nness of the current world. In seeking shelter, sustenance, livelihood, we \ndo so \"for the sake of\" constant possibilities ofDasein which are very close \nto it;1 upon these the entity for which its own Being is an issue, has already \nprojected itself. Thrown into its 'there', every Dasein has been factically \nsubmitted to a definite 'world'-i ts 'world'. At the same time those facti\u00ad\ncal projections which are closest to it, have been guided by its concernful \nlostness in the \"they\". To this lostness, one's own Dasein can appeal, and \nthis appeal can be understood in the way of resoluteness. But in that case \nthis authentic disclosedness modifies with equal primordiality both the way \nin which the 'world' is discovered (and this is founded upon that dis\u00ad\nclosedness) and the way in which the Dasein-with of Others is disclosed. \nThe 'world' which is ready-to-hand does not become another one 'in its \n298 \ncontent', nor does the circle of Others get exchanged for a new one ; but \nboth one's Being towards the ready-to-hand understandingly and con\u00ad\ncernfully, and one's solicitous Being with Others, are now given a \ndefinite character in terms of their ownmost potentiality-for-Being\u00ad\ntheir-Selves. \nResoluteness, as authentic Being-one' s-Selj, does not detach Dasein from \nits world, nor does it isolate it so that it becomes a free-floating \"I\". And \nhow should it, when resoluteness as authentic disclosedness, is authentically \nnothing else than Being-in-the-world? Resoluteness brings the Self right into \nits current concernful Being-alongside what is ready-to-hand, and pushes \nit into solicitous Being with Others. \nIn the light of the \"for-the-sake-of-which\" of one's self-chosen potent\u00ad\niality-for-Being, resolute Dasein frees itself for its world. Dasein's resolute\u00ad\nness towards itself is what first makes it possible to let the Others who are \nwith it 'be' in their ownmost potentiality-for-Being, and to co-disclose \nthis potentiality in the solicitude which leaps forth and liberates. When \nDasein is resolute, it can become the 'conscience' of Others.

The essence of Dasein as an \nentity is its existence. Resoluteness 'exists' only as a resolution [Entschluss] \nwhich understandingly projects itself. But on what basis does Dasein \ndisclose itself in resoluteness ? On what is it to resolve ?1 Only the resolution \nitself can give the answer. One would completely misunderstand the \nphenomenon of resoluteness if one should want to suppose that this con\u00ad\nsists simply in taking up possibilities which have been proposed and \nrecommended, and seizing hold of them. The resolution is precisely the dis\u00ad\nclosive projection and determination of what is factically possible at the tim. To \nresoluteness, the indefiniteness characteristic of every potentiality-for-Being \ninto which Dasein has been factically thrown, is something that neces\u00ad\nsarily belongs. Only in a resolution is resoluteness sure of itself. The exist\u00ad\nentiell indefiniteness of resoluteness never makes itself definite except in a \nresolution; yet it has, all the same, its existential definiteness. \nWhat one resolves upon in resoluteness has been prescribed ontologically \nin the existentiality of Dasein in general as a potentiality-for-Being in the \nmanner of concernful solicitude.

Resoluteness \n299 \nappropriates untruth authentically. Dasein is already in irresoluteness \n[Unentschlossenheit], and soon, perhaps, wil be in it again. The term \n\"irresoluteness' merely expresses that phenomenon which we have Inter\u00ad\npreted as a Being-surrendered to the way in which things have been \nprevalently interpreted by the \"they\". Dasein, as a they-self, gets 'lived' \nby the common-sense ambiguity of that publicness in which nobody \nresolves upon anything but which has always made its decision.11 \"Reso\u00ad\nluteness\" signifies letting oneself be summoned out of one's lostness in the \n\"they\". The irresoluteness of the \"they\" remains dominant notwith\u00ad\nstanding, but it cannot impugn resolute existence. In the counter\u00ad\nconcept to irresoluteness, as resoluteness as existentially understood, \nwe do not have in mind any ontico-psychical characteristic in the sense of \nBeing-burdened with inhibitions. Even resolutions remain dependent upon \n1 'Aber woraufhin erschliest sich das Dasein in der Entschlossenheit?

Indeed it delimits the existential structure of that authentic \npotentiality-for-Being which the conscience attests-wanting to have a \nconscience. In this potentiality we have recognized the appropriate way \nof understanding the appeal. This makes it entirely plain that when the \ncall of conscience summons us to our potentiality-for-Being, it does not \nhold before us some empty ideal of existence, but calls us forth into the \nSituation. This existential positivity which the call of conscience possesses \nwhen rightly understood, gives us at the same time an insight : it makes \nus see to what extent we fail to recognize the disclosive character of the \nconscience if the tendency of the call is restricted to indebtednesses which \nhave already occurred or which we have before us ; it also makes us see \nto what extent the concrete understanding of the voice of conscience is \nonly seemingly transmitted to us if this restriction is made. When our \nunderstanding of the appeal is Interpreted existentially as resoluteness, \nthe conscience is revealed as that kind of Being-included in the very \nbasis of Dasein2-in which Dasein makes possible for itself its factical \nexistence, thus attesting its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. \nThis phenomenon which we have exhibited as \"resoluteness' can hardly \nbe confused with an empty 'habitus' or an indefinite 'velleity'. Resoluteness \ndoes not first take cognizance of a Situation and put that Situation before \nitself; it has put itself into that Situation already. 3 As resolute, Dasein is \nalready taking action. The term 'take action'4 is one which we are purposely \navoiding. For in the first place this term must be taken so broadly that \n\"activity\" [Aktivitat] will also embrace the passivity of resistance. In the \nsecond place, it suggests a misunderstanding in the ontology of Dasein, as \nif resoluteness were a special way of behaviour belonging to the practical \nfaculty as contrasted with one that is theoretical.

'), but fails to bring out the important sense of the latter expression : 'to represent' \nor 'to form an idea of'. \n\" '  \"Handeln\" '.

So long as we do not forget this, every step in our Interpretation \nmust be guided by the idea of existence. What this signifies for the question \nof the possible connection between anticipation and resoluteness, is \nnothing less than the demand that we should project these existential \n303 \nphenomena upon the existentiell possibilities which have been delineated \nin them, and 'think these possibilities through to the end' in an existential \nmanner. If we do this, the working-out of anticipatory resoluteness as a \npotentiality-for-Being-a-whole such that this potentiality is authentic and \nis possible in an existentiell way, will lose the character of an arbitrary \nconstruction. It will have become a way of Interpreting whereby Dasein \nis liberated for its uttermost possibility of existence. \nIn taking this step, the existential Interpretation makes known at the \nsame time its ownmost methodological character. Up till now, except for \nsome remarks which were occasionally necessary, we have deferred \nexplicit discussions of method. Our first task was to 'go forth' towards the \nphenomena. But, before laying bare the meaning of the Being of an entity \nwhich has been revealed in its basic phenomenal content, we must stop \nfor a while in the course of our investigation, not for the purpose of \n'resting', but so that we may be impelled the more keenly. \nAny genuine method is based on viewing in advance in an appropriate \nway the basic constitution of the 'object' to be disclosed, or of the domain \nwithin which the object lies. Thus any genuinely methodical consideration\u00ad\nwhich is to be distinguished from empty discussions of technique-must \nlikewise give information about the kind of Being of the entity which has \nbeen taken as our theme. The clarification of the methodological pos\u00ad\nsibilities, requirements, and limitations of the existential analytic in \ngeneral, can alone secure the transparency which is necessary if we are to \n1 'Wenn im Vorlatifen zum Tode erst aile faktische \"Vorliiufigkeit\" des Entschliessens \neigentlich verstanden, das heisst existenziell eingeholt ware?'

(Cf. our note 3, p. 306, H. \n262 above.) Similarly our translation of'Vorlaufigkeit' as 'anticipatoriness', which brings \nout the connection with 'vorlaufen', is out of line with our usual translation of the ad\u00ad\njective 'vorlaufig' as 'provisional'. \n"

But the \nInterpretation of the ontological meaning of care must be performed on the basis of \nenvisaging phenomenologically in a full and constant manner Dasein's existential \nconstitution as we have exhibited it up till now. \nOntologically, Dasein is in principle different from everything that is \npresent-at-hand or Real. Its 'subsistence' is not based on the substan\u00ad\ntiality of a substance but on the 'Self-subsistence' of the existing Self, whose \nBeing has been conceived as care.1 The phenomenon of the Self-a \nphenomenon which is included in care-needs to be defined existentially \nin a way which is primordial and authentic, in contrast to our preparatory \nexhibition of the inauthentic they-self. Along with this, we must establish \nwhat possible ontological questions are to be directed towards the 'Self', \nif indeed it is neither substance nor subject. \nIn this way, the phenomenon of care will be adequately clarified for \nthe first time, and we shall then interrogate it as to its ontological meaning. \nWhen this meaning has been determined, temporality will have been laid \nbare. In exhibiting this, we are not led into out-of-the-way and sequestered \n304 \ndomains of Dasein; we merely get a conception of the entire phenomenal \ncontent of Dasein's basic existential constitution in the ultimate founda-\ntions of its own ontological intelligibility. Temporality gets experienced in-a \nphenomenally primordial way in Dasein's authentic Being-a-whole, in the phenom-\nenon of anticipatory resoluteness. If temporality makes itself known primordi-\nally in this, then we may suppose that the temporality of anticipatory \nresoluteness is a distinctive mode of temporality. Temporality has different \npossibilities and different ways of temporali;:;ing itself. 2 The basic possibilities \n1 'Sein \"Bestand\" griindet nicht in der Substanzialitiit einer Substanz, sondem in der \n\"Selbstiindigkeit\" des existierenden Selbst, dessen Sein als Sorge begriffen wurde.' \nIn this sentence Heidegger has used no less than five words derived from the Indo\u00ad\nEuropean base 'sta-' (Cf. English 'stand', Latin 'stare', German 'stehen') : 'Bestand', \n'Substanz', 'Substantialitit', 'Selbstiindigkeit', 'existierenden'. In each case we have used \nan English equivalent derived from the same base. \nThe ii;nportant word 'Bestand', which we have here translated somewhat arbitrarily \nas 'subsistence', and have often handled elsewhere in other ways, corresponds to the verb \n'bestehen' ('to subsist', 'to remain', 'to consist in', even 'to exist' in a broader sense than \nHeidegger's). It thus may stand for 'subsistence' in the broadest sense, or more particularly \nfor 'continued subsistence' ; and it may also stand for that of which something 'consists'\u00ad\nits 'content', the whole 'stock' of things of which it consists. This is the sense in which \nHeidegger most frequently uses it, especially in such phrases as 'der phiinomenale Best\u00ad\nand' ('the phenomenal content', 'the stock of phenomena'). \nWe have also somewhat arbitrarily translated 'Selbstiindigkeit' as 'Self-subsistence', in \naccordance with our translation of the adjective 'selbstiindig' on H. 291-!292\u00b7 But as we \nshall see later (H. 322), 'Self-constancy' would perhaps be more appropriate. \n2 'Zeitlichkeit kann sich in verschiedenen Moglichkeiten und in verschiedener Weise \nuitigen.' In ordinary German the verb 'zeitigen' means 'to bring about' or more strictly, \n'to bring to maturity' ; this is how we have translated it in the earlier portions of this work. \nIn the present section, however, and in those which follow, Heidegger is exploiting the \netymological connection of 'zeitigen' with such words as 'Zeit' ('time') and 'Zeitlichkeit' \n('temporality') ; we have accordingly ventured to translate it as 'to tempt>ralize.'

So one must not be surprised if, at first glance, temporality \ndoes not correspond to that which is accessible to the ordinary under\u00ad\nstanding as 'time'. Thus neither the way time is conceived in our ordinary \nexperience of it, nor the problematic which arises from this experience, \ncan function without examination as a criterion for the appropriateness \nof an Interpretation of time. Rather, we must, in our investigation, make \nourselves familiar beforehand with the primordial phenomenon of tempor\u00ad\nality, so that in terms of this we may cast light on the necessity, the source, \nand the reason for the dominion of the way it is ordinarily understood. \nThe primordial phenomenon of temporality will be held secure by \ndemonstrating that ifwe have regard for the possible totality, unity, and \ndevelopment of .those fundamental structures of Dasein which we have \nhitherto exhibited, these structures are all to be conceived as at bottom \n'temporal' and as modes of the temporalizing of temporality. Thus, when \ntemporality has been laid bare, there arises for the existential analytic \nthe task of repeating our analysis of Dasein in the sense of Interpreting its \nessential structures with regard to their temporality. The basic directions \nof the analyses thus required are prescribed by temporality itself. Accord\u00ad\ningly the chapter will be divided as follows : anticipatory resoluteness as \nthe way in which Dasein's potentiality-for-Being-a-whole has existentiell \nauthenticity2 (Section 62) ; the hermeneutical Situation at which we have \narrived for Interpreting the meaning of the Being of care, and the method\u00ad\nological character of the existential analytic in general (Section 63) ; care \nand Selfhood (Section 64) ; temporality as the ontological meaning of care \n305 \n(Section 65) ;  Dasein's temporality and the tasks arising therefrom of \nrepeating the existential analysis in a primordial manner (Section 66). \n\u0088 62.

Only \nwithin the horizon of this idea of Being can the distinction between exist\u00ad\nence and Reality be accomplished. Surely, in both of them what we have \nin view is Being. \nBut if we are to obtain an ontologically clarified idea of Being in \ngeneral, must we not do so by first working out that understanding-of\u00ad\nBeing which belongs to Dasein ? This understanding, however, is to be \ngrasped primordially only on the basis of a primordial Interpretation of \nDasein, in which we take the idea of existence as our clue. Does it not \nthen become altogether patent in the end that this problem offundamental \nontology which we have broached, is one which moves in a 'circle' ? \nWe have indeed already shown, in analysing the structure of under\u00ad\nstanding in general, that what gets censured inappropriately as a 'circle', \nbelongs to the essence and to the distinctive character of understanding \nas such.v111 In spite of this, if the problematic of fundamental ontology is \nto have its hermeneutical Situation clarified, our investigation must now \ncome back explicitly to this 'circular argument'. When it is objected that \nthe existential Interpretation is 'circular', it is said that we have 'pre\u00ad\nsupposed' the idea of existence and of Being in general, and that Dasein \ngets Interpreted 'accordingly', so that the idea of Being may be obtained \nfrom it. But what does 'presupposition' signify ? In positing the idea of \nexistence, do we also posit some proposition from which we deduce \nfurther propositions about the Being ofDasein, in accordance with formal \nrules of consistency ?

What common sense wishes \nto eliminate in avoiding the 'circle', on the supposition that it is measuring \nup to the loftiest rigour of scientific investigation, is nothing less than the \nbasic structure of care. Because it is primordially constituted by care, any \nDasein is already ahead of itself. As being, it has in every case already \nprojected itself upon definite possibilities of its existence ; and \u00b7 in such \nexistentiell projections it has, in a pre-ontological manner, also projected \nsomething like existence and Being. Like all research, the research which \nwants to develop and conceptualize that kind of Being which belongs to \nexistence, is itself a kind of Being which disclosive Dasein possesses; can such \nresearch be denied this projecting which is essential to Dasein? \nYet the 'charge of circularity' itself comes from a kind of Being which \nbelongs to Dasein. Something like a projection, even an ontological one, \nstill remains for the common sense of our concernful absorption in the \n\"they\" ; but it necessarily seems strange to us, because common sense barri\u00ad\ncades itself against it 'on principle'. Common sense concerns itself, whether \n'theoretically' or 'practically', only with entities which can be surveyed \nat a glance circumspectively.

Common sense mis\u00ad\nunderstands understanding. And therefore common sense must necessarily \npass off as 'violent' anything that lies beyond the reach of its understanding, \nor any attempt to go out so far. \nWhen one talks of the 'circle' in understanding, one expresses a failure \nto recognize two things: (1) that understanding as such makes up a basic \nkind of Dasein's Being, and (2) that this Being is constituted as care. To \ndeny the circle, to make a secret of it, or even to want to overcome it, \nmeans finally to reinforce this failure.

The authenticity of the \npotentiality-for-Being-one's-Self guarantees that primordial existentiality \nis something we see in advance, and this assures us that we are coining \nthe appropriate existential concepts.1 \nAt the same time our analysis of anticipatory resoluteness has led us to \nthe phenomenon of primordial and authentic truth. We have shown earlier \nhow that understanding-of-Being which prevails proximally and for the \nmost part, conceives Being in the sense of presence-at-hand, and so covers \nup the primordial phenomenon of truth.lx If, however, 'there is' Being \nonly in so far as truth 'is', and if the understanding of Being varies accord\u00ad\ning to the kind of truth, then truth which is primordial and authentic \nmust guarantee the understanding of the Being of Dasein and of Being \nin general.

The \nstructure of care, however, seems to be precisely where the attempt to \ngrasp the whole ofDasein as a phenomenon has foundered. The \"ahead-of\u00ad\nitself\" presented itself as a \"not-yet\". Byt when the \"ahead-of-itself\" which \nhad been characterized as something still outstanding, was considered in \ngenuinely existential manner, it revealed itself as Being-towards-the-end\u00ad\nsomething which, in the depths ofits Being, every Dasein is. We made it plain \nat the same time that in the call of conscience care sumons Dasein towards \nits ownmost potentiality-for-Being. When we came to understand in a prim\u00ad\nordial manner how this appeal is understood, we saw that the understand\u00ad\ning of it manifests itself as anticipatory resoluteness, which includes an \nauthentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole-a potentiality of Dasein. Thus \nthe care-structure does not speak against the possibility of Being-a-whole \nbut is the condition for the possibility of such an existentiell potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing. In the course of these analyses, it became plain that the existential \nphenomena of death, conscience, and guilt are anchored in the pheno\u00ad\nmenon of care. The totality of the structural whole has become even more richly \narticulated; and because of thir, the exirtential question of the unity of thir totality \nhas become still more urgent. \nHow are we to conceive this unity? How can Dasein exist as a unity in \nthe ways and possibilities of its Being which we have mentioned ? Mani\u00ad\nfestly, it can so exist only in such a way that it ir itself this Being in its \nessential possibilities-that in each case I am this entity. The 'I' seems to \n'hold together' the totality of the structural whole. In the 'ontology' of \nthis entity, the 'I' and the 'Self' have been conceived from the earliest \ntimes as the supporting ground (as substance or subject) . Even in its \npreparatory characterization of everydayness, our analytic has already \ncome up against the question of Dasein's \"who\". It has been shown that \nproximally and for the most part Dasein is not itself but is lost in the they\u00ad\nself, which is an existentiell modification of the authentic Self. The \nquestion of the ontological constitution of Selfhood has remained un\u00ad\nanswered. In principle, of course, we have already fixed upon a clue for \nthis problem ;xu for if the Self belongs to the essential [wesenhaften] attri-\n31 8  \nbutes of Dasein, while Dasein's 'Essence' [\"Essenz\"] lies in exirtence, then \n\"1\"-hood and Selfhood must be conceived exirtentially. On the negative \nside, it has also been shown that our ontological characterization of the \n\"they\" prohibits us from making any use of categories of presence-at-\nhand (such as substance) . It has become clear, in principle, that onto\u00ad\nlogically care is not to be derived from Reality or to be built up with the \n"

In saying \"1\", \nDasein expresses itself about 'itself'. It is not necessary that in doing so \nDasein should make any utterance. With the '1', this entity has itself in \nview. The content of this expression is regarded as something utterly \nsimple. In each case, it just stands for me and nothing further. Also, this \n'1', as something simple, is not an attribute of other Things ; it is not \nitself a predicate, but the absolute 'subject'. What is expressed and what is \naddressed in saying \"I\", is always met as the same persisting something. \nThe characteristics of'simplicity', 'substantiality', and 'personality', which \nKant, for instance, made the basis for his doctrine 'of the paralogisms of \npure reason' ,xv arise from a genuine pre-phenomenological experience. \nThe question remains whether that which we have experienced ontically \nin this way may be Interpreted ontologically with the help of the 'cate\u00ad\ngories' mentioned. \nKant, indeed, in strict conformity with the phenomenal content given in \nsaying \"I\", shows that theontical theses about thesoul-substancewhichhave \nbeen inferred [erschlossenen] from these characteristics, are without justifi\u00ad\ncation. But in so doing, he merely rejects a wrong ontical explanation of the \n\"I\" ; he has by no means achieved an ontological Interpretation ofSelfhood, \nnor has he even obtained some assurance of it and made positive preparation \nfor it. Kant makes a more rigorous attempt than his predecessors to keep \nhold of the phen<;>menal content of saying \"I\" ; yet even though in theory \nhe has denied that the ontical foundations of the ontology of the substantial \n3 I 9 \napply to the \"I\", he still slips back into this same inappropriate ontology. This \nwill be shown more exactly, in order that we may establish what it means \nontologically to take saying \"I\" as the starting-point for the analysis of \nSelf hood. The Kantian analysis of the 'I think' is now to be adduced as an \nillustration, but only so far as is demanded for clarifying these problems.xvi \nThe 'I' is a bare consciousness, accompanying all concepts. In the \n'1', 'nothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of \nthoughts'.

In \nKant's sense we must take saying \"I\" as saying \"I think\". Kant tries to \nestablish the phenomenal content of the \"I\" as res cogitans. If in doing so \nhe calls this \"I\" a 'logical subject', that does not mean that the \"I\" in \ngeneral is a concept obtained merely by way oflogic. The \"I\" is rather the \nsubject of logical behaviour, of binding together. 'I think' means 'I bind \ntogether'. All binding together is an 'I bind together'. In any taking\u00ad\ntogether or relating, the \"I\" always underlies-the V1TOK\u00a3lJL\u00a3vov. The \nsubjectum is therefore 'consciousness in itself', not a representation but \nrather the 'form' of representation. That is to say, the \"I think\" is not \nsomething represented, but the formal structure of representing as such, \nand this formal structure alone makes it possible for anything to have \nbeen represented. When we speak of the \"form\" of representation, we \nhave in view neither a framework nor a universal concept, but that which, \nas \u00a31Sos, makes every representing and everything represented be \nwhat it is. If the \"I\" is understood as the form of representation, this \namounts to saying that it is the 'logical subject'. \nKant's analysis has two positive aspects. For one thing, he sees the \nimpossibility of ontically reducing the \"I\" to a substance ; for another \n320 \nthing, he holds fast to the \"I\" as 'I think'. Nevertheless, he takes this \"I\" \nas subject again, and he does so in a sense which is ontologically inappro\u00ad\npriate. For the ontological concept of the subject characterizes not the Self-\nhood of the \"!\" qua Self, but the selfsameness and steadiness of something that is \nalways present-at-hand. To define the \"I\" ontologically as \"subject\" means \nto regard it as something always present-at-hand. The\u00b7 Being of the \"I\" \nis understood as the Reality of the res cogitans.xix \nBut how does it come about that while the 'I think' gives Kant a \ngenuine phenomenal starting-point, he cannot exploit it ontologically, and \nhas to fall back on the 'subject'-that is to say, something substantial? The \n321 \n\"I\" is not just an 'I think', but an 'I think something'. And does not \nKant himself keep on stressing that the \"I\" remains related to its repre\u00ad\nsentations, and would be nothing without them ? \nFor Kant, however, these representations are the 'empirical', which is \n'accompanied' by the \"1\"-the appearances to which the \"I\" 'clings'. \nKant nowhere shows the kind ofBeing of this 'clinging' and 'accompany\u00ad\ning'. At bottom, however, their kind ofBeing is understood as the constant \nBeing-present-at-hand of the \"I\" along with its representations. Kant has \nindeed avoided cutting the \"I\" adrift from thinking ; but he has done so \nwithout starting with the 'I think' itself in its full essential content as an \n"

Kant did not see the phenomenon of the world, and was \nconsistent enough to keep the 'representations' apart from the a priori \ncontent of the 'I think'. But as a consequence the \"I\" was again forced \nback to an isolated subject, accompanying representations in a way which \nis ontologically quite indefinite.xx \nIn saying \"!\", Dasein expresses itself as Being-in-the-world. But does saying \n\"I\" in the everyday manner have itself in view as being-in-the-world \n[in-der-Welt-seiend] ? Here we must make a distinction. When saying \n\"I\", Dasein surely has in view the entity which, in every case, it is itself. \nThe everyday interpretation of the Self, however, has a tendency to \nunderstand itself in terms of the 'world' with which it is concerned. When \nDasein has itself in view ontically, it fails to see itself in relation to the kind \nof Being of that entity which it is itself. And this holds especially for the \nbasic state, of Dasein, Being-in-the-world.xxt \n322 \nWhat is the motive for this 'fugitive' way of saying \"I\" ? It is motivated \nby Dasein's falling; for as falling, it flees in the face of itself into the \n\"they\".1 When the \"I\" talks in the 'natural' manner, this is performed by \nthe they-self.2 What expresses itself in the 'I' is that-Self which, proxim\u00ad\nally and for the most part, I am not authentically. When one is absorbed \nin the everyday multiplicity and the rapid succession [Sich-jagen] of that \nwith which one is concerned, the Self of the self-forgetful \"I am concerned' \nshows itself as something simple which is constantly selfsame but indefinite \nand empty. Yet one is that with which one concerns oneself. In the \n'natural' ontical way in which the \"I\" talks, the phenomenal content of \nthe Dasein which one has in view in the \"l\" gets overlooked ; but this gives \nno justification for our joining in this overlooking of it, or for forcing upon the \nproblematic of the Self an inappropriate 'categorial' horizon when we \nInterpret the \"I\" ontologically. \nOf course by thus refusing to follow the everyday way in which the \"I\" \n1 'Durch das Verfallen des Daseins, als welches es vor sich selbst jlieht in das Man.' \nThe 'es' appears only in the later editions. \n11 'Die \"natiirliche\" Ich-Rede vollzieht das Man-selbst.' \n"

The they-self keeps \non saying \"I\" most loudly and most frequently because at bottom it is not \nauthentically itself, and evades its authentic potentiality-for-Being.

In terms of care the constancy of the Self, as the \nsupposed persistence of the subjectum, gets clarified. But the phenomenon \nof this authentic potentiality-for-Being also opens our eyes for the constancy \nof the Self in the sense of its having achieved some sort of position.1 The \nconstancy of the Self, in the double sense of steadiness and steadfastness, is \nthe authentic counter-possibility to the non-Self-constancy which is charac\u00ad\nteristic of irresolute falling. 2 Existentially, \"Self-constancy\" signifies nothing \nother than anticipatory resoluteness.

The noun 'Unselbstiindigkeit' ordinarily stands for inability to stand on \none's own feet or to make up one's mind independently. \u00b7 But Heidegger expands it \nto 'Unselbst-stiindigkeit', which not only suggests instability and a failure to stand by \noneself, but also the constancy or stability of that which. is other than the Selm-the \nnon-Self, or more specifically, the they-self.

When we inquire about the meaning of care, we \nare asking what makes possible the totality of the articulated structural whole of \ncare, in the unity of its articulation as we have unfolded it. \nTaken strictly, \"meaning\" signifies the \"upon-which\" of the primary \nprojection of the understanding of Being. When Being-in-the-world has \nbeen disclosed to itself and understands the Being of that entity which it \nitself is, it understands equiprimordial\u00eay the Being of entities discovered \nwithin-the-world, even if such Being has not been made a theme, and has \nnot yet even been differentiated into its primary modes of existence and \nReality. All ontical experience of entities-both circumspective calcula\u00ad\ntion of the ready-to-hand, and positive scientific cognition of the present\u00ad\nat-hand-is based upon projections of the Being of the corresponding \nentities-projections which in every case are more or less transparent. \nBut in these projections there lies hidden the \"upon-which\" of the \nprojection; and on this, as it were, the understanding of Being nourishes \nitself. \nIf we say that entities 'have meaning', this signifies that they have \nbecome accessible in their Being; and this Being, as projected upon its \n1 'Das Woraufhin eines Entwurfs freilegen, besagt, das erschliessen, was das Entworfene \nermoglicht.'

This sort of thing is possible only in that Dasein can, \nindeed, come towards itself in its ownmost possibility, and that it can put \nup with this possibility as a possibility in thus letting itself come towards \nitself-in other words, that it exists. This letting-itself-come-towards-itself \nin that distinctive possibility which it puts up with, is the primordial \nphenomenon of the future as coming towards. 3 If either authentic or \n1 'Die Frage nach dem Sinn des Seins eines Seienden macht das Woraufhin des allem \nSein von Seiendem zugrundeliegenden Seinsverstehens zum Thema.'

By the term 'futural', we do not here \nhave in view a \"now\" which has not yet become 'actual' and which some\u00ad\ntime will be for the first time. We have in view the coming [Kunft] in \nwhich Dasein, in its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, comes towards itself. \nAnticipation makes Dasein authentically futural, and in such a way that the \nanticipation itself is possible only in so far as Dasein, as being, is always \ncoming towards itself-that is to say, in so far as it is futural in its Being \nin general. \nAnticipatory resoluteness understands Dasein in its own essential \nBeing-guilty. This understanding means that in existing one takes over \nBeing-guilty; it means being the thrown basis of nullity. But taking \nover thrownness signifies being Dasein authentically as it already was. 1 \nTaking over thrownness, however, is possible only in such a way that the \nfutural Dasein can be its ownmost 'as-it-already-was'-that is to say, its \n326 \n'been' [sein \"Gewesen\"]. Only in so far as Dasein is as an \"l-am-as-having\u00ad\nbeen\", can Dasein come towards itself futurally in such a way that it \ncomes back. 2 As authentically futural, Dasein is authentically as \"having \nbeen\". 3 Anticipation of one's uttermost and ownmost possibility is coming \nback understandingly to one's ownmost \"been\". Only so far as it is futural \ncan Dasein be authentically as having been. The character of \"having \nbeen\" arises, in a certain way, from the future. 4 \nAnticipatory resoluteness discloses the current Situation of the \"there\" \nin such a way that existence, in taking action, is circumspectively con\u00ad\ncerned with what is factically ready-to-hand environmentally.

(The use of 'zukommen' with \nthe preposition 'auf' is to be distinguished from a use of this same verb with the dative \nwhich we have met in earlier chapters in the sense of 'belongs to . .  .', 'is becoming \nto \u2022\n.\n .', or 'has coming to \u2022\n\u2022\n .'.) \n1 'Dbernahme der Geworfenheit aber bedeutet, das Dasein in dem, wie es je schon war, \neigentlich sein.' \nll 'N ur sofern Dasein iiberhaupt ist als ich bin-gewesen, kann es zukiinftig auf sich selbst \n10 zukommen, dass es zurick-kommt.' Many German verbs form their perfect tense with \nthe help of the auxiliary 'sein' ('to be') in place of the somewhat more usual 'haben' \n('have'), just as we sometimes say in English 'he is gone' instead of 'he has gone'. \nAmong such verbs is 'sein' itself. This 'I have been' is expressed by 'ich bin gewesen'; this \nmight be translated as 'I am been', but in this context we have ventured to translate it as \n'I am as having been'. \n8 'Eigentlich zukiinftig ist das Dasein eigentlich gewesen.' \n\u009b 'Die Gewesenheit entspringt in gewisser Weise der Zukunft.' Here 'The character of \nhaving been' represents 'Die Gewesenheit' (literally, 'beenhood'). Heidegger distinguishes \nthis sharply from 'die Vergangenheit' ('pastness') .

Only \nas the Present [Gegenwart]l in the sense of making present, can resoluteness \nbe what it is: namely, letting itself be encountered undisguisedly by that \nwhich it seizes upon in taking action. \nComing back to itself futurally, resoluteness brings itself into the \nSituation by making present. The character of \"having been\" arises from \nthe future, and in such a way that the future which \"has been\" (or better, \nwhich \"is in the process of having been\") releases from itself the Present.2 \nThis phenomenon has the unity of a future which makes present in \nthe process of having been; we designate it as \"temporality\".3 Only in so \nfar as Dasein has the definite character of temporality, is the authentic \npotentiality-for-Being-a-whole of anticipatory resoluteness, as we have \ndescribed it, made possible for Dasein itself. Temporality reveals itself as the \nmeaning of authentic care. \nThe phenomenal content of this meaning, drawn from the state of \nBeing of anticipatory resoluteness, fills in the signification of the term \n\"temporality\".

Inasmuch as Dasein understands \nitself in a way which, proximally and for the most part, is inauthentic, we \nmay suppose that 'time' as ordinarily understood does indeed represent \na genuine phenomenon, but one which is derivative [ein abkiinftiges]. It \narises from inauthentic temporality, which has a source of its own. The \nconceptions of 'future', 'past' and 'Present' have first arisen in terms of \nthe inauthentic way of understanding time. In terminologically delimiting \n327 \nthe primordial and authentic phenomena which correspond to these, we \nhave to struggle against the same difficulty which keeps all ontological \nterminology in its grip. When violences are done in this field of investiga\u00ad\ntion, they are not arbitrary but have a necessity grounded in the \nfacts.

But this very \nlevelling off, in accordance with its existential meaning, is grounded in \nthe possibility of a definite kind of temporalizing, in conformity with \nwhich temporality temporalizes as inauthentic the kind of 'time' we have \njust mentioned. If, therefore, we demonstrate that the 'time' which is \naccessible to Dasein's common sense is not primordial, but arises rather \nfrom authentic temporality, then, in accordance with the principle, \"a \npotiori fit denominatio\", we are justified in designating as \"primordial time\" \nthe temporaliry which we have now laid bare. \n1 'Zukunft, Gewesenheit, Gegenwart zeigen die phiinomenalen Charaktere des \"Auf\u00ad\nsich-zu\", des \"Zuriick auf\", des \"Begegnenlassens von\".'

This is so, even though \ntemporality does not first arise through a cumulative sequence of the \necstases, but in each case temporalizes itself in their equiprimordiality. \nBut within this equiprimordiality, the modes oftemporalizing are different. \nThe difference lies in the fact that the nature of the temporalizing can \nbe determined primarily in terms of the different ecstases. Primordial and \nauthentic temporality temporalizes itself in terms of the authentic \nfuture and in such a way that in having been futurally, it first of \nall awakens the Present.1 The primary phenomenon of primordial and authentic \ntemporality is the future. The priority of the future will vary according to the \nways in which the temporalizing of inauthentic temporality itself is \nmodified, but it will still come to the fore even in the derivative kind of \n'time'.11 \nCare is Being-towards-death. We have defined \"anticipatory resolute\u00ad\nness\" as authentic Being towards the possibility which we have character\u00ad\nized as Dasein's utter impossibility. In such Being-towards-its-end, Dasein \nexists in a way which is authentically whole as that entity which it can be \nwhen 'thrown into death'. This entity does not have an end at which it \njust stops, but it exists finitely. 3 The authentic future is temporalized pri-\n330 \nmarily by that temporality which makes up the meaning of anticipatory \nresoluteness ; it thus reveals itself as finite.' But 'does not time go on' in \nspite of my own no-longer-Dasein ?5 And can there not be an unlimited \nnumber of things which still lie 'in the future' and come along out of it ? \nWe must answer these questions affirmatively. In spite of this, they do \nnot contain any objections to the finitude of primordial temporality\u00ad\nbecause this\u00b7 is something which is no longer handled by these at all. \nThe question is not about everything that still can happen 'in a time that \ngoes on', or about what kind of letting-come-towards-oneself we can \nencounter 'out of this tiine', but about how \"coming-towards-oneself\" is, \nas such, to be primordially defined.

Primordial and authentic coming\u00ad\ntowards-oneself is the meaning of existing in one's ownmost nullity. In \nour thesis that temporality is primordially finite, we are not disputing \nthat 'time goes on'; we are simply holding fast to the phenomenal char\u00ad\nacter of primordial temporality-a character which shows itself in what \nis projected in Dasein's primordial existential projecting. \nThe temptation to overlook the finitude of the primordial and authentic \nfuture and therefore the finitude of temporality, or alternatively, to hold \n'a priori' that such finitude is impossible, arises from the way in which the \nordinary understanding of time is constantly thrusting itself to the fore. \nIf the ordinary understanding is right in knowing a time which is endless, \nand in knowing only this, it has not yet been demonstrated that it also \nunderstands this time and its 'infinity'. What does it mean to say, 'Time \ngoes on' or 'Time keep passing away?' What is the signification of 'in \ntime' in general, and of the expressions 'in the future' and 'out of the \nfuture' in particular? In what sense is 'time' endless? Such points need to \nbe cleared up, if the ordinary objections to the finitude of primordial time \nare not to remain groundless. But we can clear them up effectively only \nif we have obtained an appropriate way of formulating the question as \nregards finitude and in-finitude. 2 Such a formulation, however, arises only \nif we view the primordial phenomenon of time understandingly. The \nproblem is not one of how3 the 'derived' [\"abgeleitete\"] infinite time, 'in \nwhich, the ready-to-hand arises and passes away, becomes primordial finite \n331 \ntemporality; the problem is rather that of how inauthentic temporality \narises out of finite authentic temporality, and how inauthentic temporality, \nas inauthentic, temporalizes an in-finite time out of the finite. Only \nbecause primordial time is finite can the 'derived' time temporalize \nitself as infinite. In the order in which we get things into our grasp \nthrough the understanding, the finitude of time does not become fully \nvisible until we have exhibited 'endless time' so that these may be \ncontrasted. \n1 ' .\n\u2022\n\u2022\n class sie das Seinkiinnen achliesst, das heisst selbst geschlossen ist \u2022\n\u2022\n .

Because \nthe Self cannot be conceived either as substance or as subject but is \ngrounded in existence, our analysis of the inauthentic Self, the \"they\", \nhas been left wholly in tow of the preparatory Interpretation ofDasein.xxv \nNow that Selfhood has been explicitly taken back into the structure of \ncare, and therefore of temporality, the temporal Interpretation of Self\u00ad\nconstancy and non-Self-constancy1 acquires an importance of its own. \nThis Interpretation needs to be carried through separately and themati\u00ad\ncally. However, it not only gives us the right kind of insurance against the \nparalogisms and against ontologically inappropriate questions about the \nBeing of the \"I\" in general, but it provides at the same time, in accor\u00ad\ndance with its central function, a more primordial insight into the \ntemporali(.ation-structure of temporality, which reveals itself as the histori\u00ad\ncality of Dasein. The proposition, \"Dasein is historical\", is confirmed as a \nfundamental existential ontological assertion. This assertion is far removed \nfrom the mere ontical establishment of the fact that Dasein occurs in a \n'world-history'. But the historicality of Dasein is the basis for a possible \nkind of historiological understanding which in turn carries with it the \npossibility of getting a special grasp of the development of historiology \nas a science. \nBy Interpreting everydayness and historicality temporally we shall get \na steady enough view of primordial time to expose it as the condition \n333 \nwhich makes the everyday experience of time both possible and necessary. \nAs an entity for which its Being is an issue, Dasein utili(.es itself primarily \nfor itself [ verwendet sich \u2022\n.\n.\n for sich selbst], whether it does so explicitly or \nnot.

'Verwenden' means \nliterally to 'turn something away', but is often used in the sense of 'turning something to \naccount', 'utilizing it' ; in a reflexive construction such as we have here, it often takes on \nthe more special meaning of 'applying oneself' on someone's behalf. (In previous passages \nwe have generally translated 'verwenden' as 'use'.) 'Verbrauchen' means to 'consume' \nor 'use up'. 'Brauchen' too means to 'use'; but it also means to 'need', and it is hard to tell \nwhich of these senses Heidegger here has in mind. \n"

The kind of ignorance which corresponds to this, does not \nconsist in an absence or cessation of understanding, but must be regarded \nas a deficient mode of the projectedness of one's potentiality-for-Being. \nExistence can be questionable. If it is to be possible for something 'to be \nin question' [das \"In-Frage-stehen\"], a disclosedness is needed. When one \nunderstands oneself projectively in an existentiell possibility, the future \nunderlies this understanding, and it 'does so as a coming-towards-oneself \nout of that current possibility as which one's Dasein exists.

In \neach case Dasein is understandingly in the way that it can be.1 Resolute\u00ad\nness has turned out to be a kind of existing which is primordial and \nauthentic. Proximally and for the most part, to be sure, Dasein remains \nirresolute ; that is to say, it remains closed off in its ownmost potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being, to which it brings itself only when it has been individualized. \nThis implies that temporality does not temporalize itself constantly out \nof the authentic future. This inconstancy, however, does not mean that \ntemporality sometimes lacks a future, but rather that the temporalizing \nof the future takes various forms. \nTo designate the authentic future terminologically we have reserved \nthe expression \"anticipation\". This indicates that Dasein, existing authentic\u00ad\nally, lets itself come towards itself as its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-\n337 \nthat the future itself must first win itself, not from a Present, but from the \ninauthentic future. If we are to provide a formally undifferentiated term \nfor the future, we may use the one with which we have designated the first \nstructural item of care-the \"ahead-of-itself\". Factically, \nDasein \nis \nconstantly ahead of itself, but inconstantly anticipatory with regard to its \nexistentiell possibility. \nHow is the inauthentic future to be contrasted with this ? Just as the \nauthentic future is revealed in resoluteness, the inauthentic future, as an \necstatical mode, can reveal itself only ifwe go back ontologically from the \ninauthentic understanding of everyday concern to its existential-temporal \nmeaning. As care, Dasein is essentially ahead of itself. Proximaly and for \nthe most part, concernful Being-in-the-world understands itself in terms \nof that with which it is concerned. Inauthentic understanding2 projects \nitself upon that with which one can concern oneself, or upon what is \nfeasible, urgent, or indispensable in our everyday business. But that with \nwhich we concern ourselves is as it is for the sake of that potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing which cares. This potentiality lets Dasein come towards itself in its \nconcernful Being-alongside that with which it is concerned. Dasein does \nnot come towards itself primarily in its ownmost non-relational potential\u00ad\nity-for-Being, but it awaits this concernfully in terms of that which yields or \ndenies the object of its concern. 3 Dasein comes towards itself from that with \nwhich it concerns itself. The inauthentic future has the character of \nawaiting. 4 One's concernful understanding of oneself as they-self in terms \n1 'Verstehend ist das Dasein je, wie ea sein kan.' \n2 'Das uneigentliche Verstehen \u2022\n\u2022\n .'

In each case some sort of awaiting must have disclosed the \nhorizon and the range from which something can be expected. Expecting \nis founded upon awaiting, and is a mode of that future which temporali\u0318es itself \nauthenticalry as anticipation. Hence there lies in anticipation a more pri\u00ad\nmordial Being-towards-death than in the concernful expecting of it. \nUnderstanding, as existing in the potentiality-for-Being, however it \nmay have been projected, is primariry futural. But it would not temporalize \nitself if it were not temporal-that is, determined with equal primordiality \nby having been and by the Present. The way in which the latter ecstasis \nhelps constitute inauthentic understanding, has already been made plain \nin a rough and ready fashion. Everyday concern understands itself in \nterms of that potentiality-for-Being which confronts it as coming from its \npossible success or failure with regard to whatever its object of concern may \nbe. Corresponding to the inauthentic future (awaiting), there is a special \nway of Being-alongside the things with which one concerns oneself. This \nway of Being-alongside is the Present-the \"waiting-towards\" ;1 this \n338 \necstatical mode reveals itself if we adduce for comparison this very same \necstasis, but in the mode of authentic temporality. To the anticipation \nwhich goes with resoluteness, there belongs a Present in accordance with \nwhich a resolution discloses the Situation. In resoluteness, the Present is \nnot only brought back from distraction with the objects of one's closest \nconcern, but it gets held in the future and in having been. That Present \nwhich is held in authentic temporality and which thus is authentic itself, we \ncall the \"moment of vision\". 2 This term must be understood in the active \nsense as an ecstasis. It means the resolute rapture with which Dasein is \ncarried away to whatever possibilities and circumstances are encountered \nin the Situation as possible objects of concern, but a rapture which is held \nin resoluteness. 3 The moment of vision is a phenomenon which in principle \n1 'Gegen-wart'. In this context it seems well to translate this expresion by a hendiady$ \nwhich, like Heidegger's hyphenation, calls attention to the root-meaning of the noun \n'Gegenwart'.

While the words 'Entriickung' and 'Ekstase' can thus be used in many contexts as \nsynonyms, for Heidegger the former seems the more general. (See H. 365 below.) We \nshall translate 'entriicken' by 'rapture' or 'carry away', or, as in this case, by a combina\u00ad\ntion of these expressions. \n"

The \"been\" is not what \nfirst brings one face to face with the thrown entity which one is oneself; \nbut the ecstasis of the \"been\" is what first makes it possible to find oneself \nin the way of having a state-of-mind.1 \nUnderstanding is grounded primarily in the future ; one's state-of-mind, \nhowever, temporalizes itself primarily in having been. 2 Moods temporalize \nthemselves-that is, their specific ecstasis belongs to a future and a Present \nin such a way, indeed, that these equiprimordial ecstases are modified by \nhaving been. \nWe have emphasized that while moods, of course, are ontically well\u00ad\nknown to us [bekannt] , they are not recognized [erkannt] in their \nprimordial existential function. They are regarded as fleeting Experiences \nwhich 'colour' one's whole 'psychical condition'. Anything which is \nobserved to have the character of turning up and disappearing in a \nfleeting manner, belongs to the primordial constancy of existence. But \nall the same, what should moods have in common with 'time' ? That these \n'Experiences' come and go, that they run their course 'in time', is a trivial \nthing to establish. Certainly. And indeed this can be established in an \nontico-psychological maner. Our task, however, is to exhibit the onto\u00ad\nlogical structure of having-a-mood in its existential-temporal Constitution. \nAnd of course this is proximally just a matter of first making the tempora\u00ad\nlity of moods visible. The thesis that 'one's state-of-mind is grounded \nprimarily in having been' means that the existentially basic character \nof moods lies in bringing one back to something. This bringing-back does not \nfirst produce a having been ; but in any state-of-mind some mode of having \nbeen is made manifest for existential analysis. 3 So if we are to Interpret \n1 'Das Bringen vor das geworfene Seiende, das man selbst ist, schafft nicht erst das \nGewesen, sondem desen Ekstase ennoglicht erst das Sich-finden in der Weise des Sich\u00ad\nbefindens.' We have construed 'das Gewesen' and 'desen Ekstase' as the subjects of their \nrespective clauses, but other interpretations are not impossible. \n2 In our italicization we follow the older editions. In the newer editions 'Gewesenheit' \n('having been') is not italicized. \na 'Dieses stellt die Gewesenheit nicht erst her, sondem die Befindlichkeit offenbart fUr \ndie existenziale Analyse je einen Modus der Gewesenheit.' The gramar of the first \nclause is ambiguous. \n"

Fear is a fearing in the face tifsomething threatening\u00ad\nof something which is detrimental to Dasein's factical potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing, and which brings itself close in the way we have described, within \nthe range of the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand with which we \nconcern ourselves. Fearing discloses something threatening, and it does \nso by way of everyday circumspection. A subject which merely beholds \nwould never be able to discover anything of the sort. But if something is \ndisclosed when one fears in the face of it, is not this disclosure a letting\u00ad\nsomething-come-towards-oneself [ ein Auf-sich-zukommenlassen] ? Has \nnot \"fear\" been rightly defined as \"the expectation of some oncoming \nevil\" [eines ankommenden Ubels] (\"malumfuturum\") ? Is not the primary \nmeaning of fear the future, and least of al, one's having been ? Not only \ndoes fearing 'relate' itself to 'something future' in the signification of \nsomething which first comes on 'in time' ; but this self-relating is itself \nfutural in the primordially temporal sense. All this is incontestable. \nManifestly an awaiting is one of the things that belong to the existential\u00ad\ntemporal Constitution of fear. But proximaly this just means that the \ntemporality of fear is one that is inauthentic. Is fearing in the face of some\u00ad\nthing merely an expecting of something threatening which is coming on ? \nSuch an expectation need not be fear already, and it is so far from being \nfear that the specific character which fear as a mood possesses is \nmissing. This character lies in the fact that in fear the awaiting lets what is \nthreatening come back [zuruckkommen] \nto \none's factically concernful \npotentiality-for-Being. Only if that to which this comes back is already \necstatically open, can that which threatens be awaited right hack to the \nentity which I myself am; only so can my Dasein be threatened.1 The \nawaiting which fears is one which is afraid 'for itself' ; that is to \nsay, fearing in the face of something, is in each case a fearing about; \n1 \u2022 Zuriick auf das Seiende, das ich bin, kann das Bedrohliche nur gewartigt, und so das \nDasein bedroht werden, wenn das Worauf des Zuriick auf . . .  schon iiberhaupt ekstatisch \noffen ist.' \n"

When one's Being\u00ad\nin-the-world has been threatened and it concerns itself with the ready-to\u00ad\nhand, it does so as a factical potentiality-for-Being of its own. In the face \nof this potentiality one backs away in bewilderment, and this kind of \nforgetting oneself is what constitutes the existential-temporal meaning of \n342 \nfear.1 Aristotle rightly defines \"fear\" as AV1T7J -rLs- P -rapax\u01a2-as \"a kind \nof depression or bewilderment\". vi This depression forces Dasein back to \nits thrownness, but in such a way that this thrownness gets quite closed off. \nThe bewilderment is based upon a forgetting. When one forgets and backs \naway in the face of a factical potentiality-for-Being which is resolute, one \nclings to those possibilities of self-preservation and evasion which one has \nalready discovered circumspectively beforehand. When concern is afraid, \nit leaps from next to next, because it forgets itself and therefore does not \ntake hold of any definite possibility. Every 'possible' possibility offers itself, \nand this means that the impossible ones do so too. The man who fears, \ndoes not stop with any of these; his 'environment' does not disappear, but \nit is encountered without his knowing his way about in it any longer. 2 \nThis bewildered making-present of the first thing that comes into one's head, \nis something that belongs with forgetting oneself in fear. It is well known, \nfor instance, that the inhabitants of a burning house will often 'save' the \nmost indifferent things that are most closely ready-to-hand. When one has \nforgotten oneself and makes present a jumble of hovering possibilities, one \nthus makes possible that bewilderment which goes to make up the mood\u00ad\ncharacter of fear. 3 The having forgotten which goes with such bewilder\u00ad\nment modifies the awaiting too and gives it the character of a depressed \nor bewildered awaiting which is distinct from any pure expectation. \nThe specific ecstatical unity which makes it existentially possible to be \nafraid, temporalizes itself primarily out of the kind offorgetting character\u00ad\nized above, which, as a mode of having been, modifies its Present and \nits future in their own temporalizing. The temporality offear is a forgetting \nwhich awaits and makes present. The common-sense interpretation of \nfear, taking its orientation from what we encounter within-the-world, \nseeks in the first instance to designate the 'oncoming evil' as that \nin the face of which we fear, and, correspondingly, to define our \nrelation to this evil as one of \"expecting\". Anything else which \n1 'Deren existenzial-zeitlicher Sinn wird konstituiert durch ein Sichvergessen : das \nverwirrte Ausriicken vor dem eigenen faktischen Seinkonnen, als welches das bedrohte \nIn-der-Welt-sein das Zuhandene besorgt.' \n2 'Bei keiner halt der Fiirchtende, die \"Umwelt\" verschwindet nicht, sondern begegnet \nin einem Sich-nicht-mehr-auskennen in ihr.' \n3 'Das selbstvergessene Gegenwartigen eines Gewirrs von schwebenden Moglichkeiten \nermoglicht die Verwirrung, als welche sie den Stimmungscharakter der Furcht ausmacht.' \nThe pronoun 'sie' does not appear in the older editions. \n"

But just as little does \nanxiety imply that one has already taken over one's existence into one's \nresolution and done so by a repeating. On the contrary, anxiety brings \none back to one's thrownness as something possible which can be repeated. \nAnd in this way it also reveals the possibility of an authentic potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being-a potentiality which must, in repeating, come back to its \nthrown \"there\", but come back as something future which comes towards \n[ zukiinftiges]. The character of having been is constitutive for the state-of\u00ad\nmind of anxiery; and bringing one face to face with repeatabiliry is the specific \necstatical mode of this character. \n344 \nThe forgetting which is constitutive for fear, bewilders Dasein and lets \nit drift back and forth between 'worldly' possibilities which it has not seized \nupon. In contrast to this making-present which is not held on to, the Pre\u00ad\nsent of anxiety is held on to when one brings oneself back to one's ownmost \nthrownness. The existential meaning of anxiety is such that it cannot lose \nitself in something with which it might be concerned. If anything like \nthis happens in a similar state-of-mind, this is fear, which the everyday \nunderstanding confuses with anxiety. But even though the Present of \nanxiety is held on to, it does not as yet have the character of the moment of \nvision, which temporalizes itself in a resolution. Anxiety merely brings \none into the mood for a possible resolution. The Present of anxiety holds \nthe moment of vision at the ready [arif dem Sprung] ; as such a moment it \nitself, and only itself, is possible. \nThe temporality of anxiety is peculiar; for anxiety is grounded pri\u00ad\nmordially in having been, and only out of this do the future and the Present \ntemporalize themselves ; in this peculiar temporality is demonstrated the \npossibility of that power which is distinctive for the mood of anxiety. In \nthis, Dasein is taken all the way back to its naked uncanniness, and becomes \nfascinated byit.1 This fascination, however, not only takes Dasein back from \nits 'worldly' possibilities, but at the same time gives it the possibility of an \nauthentic potentiality-for-Being. \n1 'An der eigentiimlichen Zeitlichkeit der Angst, class sie urspriinglich in der Gewesen\u00ad\nheit griindet und aus ihr erst Zukunft und Gegenwart sich zeitigen, erweist sich die \nMiigichkeit der Miichtigkeit, durch die sich die Stimmung der Angst auszeichnet. In ihr \nist das Dasein viillig auf seine nackte Unheimlichkeit zuriickgenommen und von ihr be\u00ad\nnommen.' In these two sentences there are no less than six feminine nouns which might \nserve as the antecedents of the pronouns 'sie' and 'ihr' in their several appearances. We \nhave chosen the interpretation which seems most plausible to us, but others are perhaps \nno less defensible. The etymological connection between 'zuriickgenommen' ('taken . . .  \nback') and 'benommen' ('fascinated') does not show up in the English version; it is \nobviously deliberate, and it gets followed up in the next sentence. \n"

Anxiety, however, springs \nfrom Dasein itself. When fear assails us, it does so from what is within\u00ad\nthe-world. Anxiety arises out of Being-in-the-world as thrown Being\u00ad\ntowards-death. When understood temporally, this 'mounting' of anxiety \nout ofDasein, means that the future and the Present of anxiety temporalize \nthemselves out of a primordial Being-as-having-been in the sense of \nbringing us back to repeatability. But anxiety can mount authentically \nonly in a Dasein which is resolute. He who is resolute knows no fear; \nbut he understands the possibility of anxiety as the possibility of the very \nmood which neither inhibits nor bewilders him. Anxiety liberates him \nfrom possibilities which 'count for nothing' [\"nichtigen\"], and lets him \nbecome free for those which are authentic. \u00b7l \nAlthough both fear and anxiety, as modes of state-of-mind, are grounded \nprimarily in having been, they each have different sources with regard to \ntheir own temporalization in the temporality of care. Anxiety springs from \nthe future of resoluteness, while fear springs from the lost Present, of which \n345 \nfear is fearfully apprehensive, so that it falls prey to it more than ever. 2 \nBut may not the thesis of the temporality of moods hold only for those \nphenomena which we have selected for our analysis ? How is a temporal \nmeaning to be found in the pallid lack of mood which dominates the 'grey \neveryday' through and through ? And how about the temporality of such \nmoods and affects as hope, joy, enthusiasm, gaiety ?

Of course these must be \nInterpreted on the broader basis of an existential analytic of Dasein that \nhas been well worked out. But even a phenomenon like hope, which seems \nto be founded wholly upon the future, must be analysed in much the same \nway as fear. Hope has sometimes been characterized as the expectation \nof a bonum futurum, to distinguish it from fear, which relates itself to a \nmalum futurum. But what is decisive for the structure of hope as a pheno\u00ad\nmenon, is not so much the 'futural' character of that to which it relates itself \n1 'Beide Stimmungen, Furcht und Angst, \"kommen\" jedoch nie nur isoliert \"vor\" im \n\"Erlebnisstrom\", sondem be-stimmen je ein Verstehen, bzw. sich aus einem solchen.' \nHeidegger writes 'be-stimmen' with a hyphen to call attention to the fact that the words \n'bestimmen' ('determine') and 'Stimmung' ('mood') have a common stem. \n2 'Die Angst entspringt aus der Zukunft der Entschlossenheit, die Furcht aus der \nverlorenen Gegenwart, die furchtsam die Furcht befirchtet, urn ihr so erst recht zu \nverfallen.'

Of course \nwhen one speaks of the rapture with which one's existence is carried away \nin making present, this does not signify that Dasein detaches itself from \nits Self and its \"I\". Even when it makes present in the most extreme \nmanner, it remains temporal-that is, awaiting and forgetful. In making \npresent, moreover, Dasein still understands itself, though it has been \nalienated from its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, which is based primarily \non the authentic future and on authentically having been. But in so far \nas making-present is always offering something 'new', it does not let \nDasein come back to itself and is constantly tranquillizing it anew. This \ntranquillizing, however, strengthens in turn the tendency towards leaping \naway. Curiosity is 'activated' not by the endless immensity of what we \nhave not yet seen, but rather by the falling kind of temporalizing which \nbelongs to the Present as it leaps away. 2 Even if one has seen everything, \nthis is precisely when curiosity fabricates something new. \nAs a mode of temporalizing, the 'leaping-away' of the Present is \ngrounded in the essence of temporality, which is finite. Having been \nthrown into Being-towards-death, Dasein flees-proximally and for the \nmost part-in the face of this throwness, which has been more or less \nexplicitly revealed. The Present leaps away from its authentic future \nand from its authentic having been, so that it lets Dasein come to \nits authentic existence only by taking a detour through that Present. \nThe 'leaping-away' of the Present-that is, the falling into lostness\u00ad\nhas its source in that primordial authentic temporality itself which makes \npossible thrown Being-towards-death. 3 \nWhile Dasein can indeed be brought authentically face to face with its \nthrownness, so as to understand itself in that thrownness authentically, \nnevertheless, this thrownness remains closed off from Dasein as regards \nthe ontical \"whence\" apd \"how\" of it.

We have called concernful Being alongside the 'world' \nour \"dealings in and with the environment\".xv As phenomena which are \nexamples of Being alongside, we have chosen the using, manipulation, \nand producing of the ready-to-hand, and the deficient and undiffer\u00ad\nentiated modes of these ; that is, we have chosen ways of Being alongside \nwhat belongs to one's everyday needs.xvt In this kind of concern Dasein's \nauthentic existence too maintains itself, even when for such existence this \nconcern is 'a matter of indifference'. The ready-to-hand things with \nwhich we concern ourselves are not the causes of our concern, as if this \nwere to arise only by the effects of entities within-the-world. Being along\u00ad\nside the ready-to-hand cannot be explained ontically in terms of the \nready-to-hand itself, nor can the ready-to-hand be derived contrariwise \nfrom this kind of Being. But neither are concern, as a kind of Being which \nbelongs to Dasein, and that with which we concern ourselves, as some\u00ad\nthing ready-to-hand within-the-world, just present-at-hand together. All the \nsame, a 'connection' subsists between them. That which is dealt with, if \nrightly understood, sheds light upon concernful dealings themselves. And \nfurthermore, if we mis the phenomenal structure of what is dealt with, \nthen we fail to recognize the existential constitution of dealing. Of course \nwe have already made an essential gain for the analysis of those entities \nwhich we encounter as closest to us, if their specific character as equip\u00ad\nment does not get passed over. But we must understand further that \nconcernful dealings never dwell with any individual item of equipment. \nOur using and manipulating of any definite item of equipment still \nremains oriented towards some equipmental context. If, for instance, we \nare searching for some equipment which we have 'misplaced', then what \nwe have in mind is not merely what we are searching for, or even primarily \nthis ; nor do we have it in mind in an isolated 'act' ; but the range of the \nequipmental totality has already been discovered beforehand.

This way of taking what is dealt with, is forced \nupon us also if we consider that character of Being which belongs dis\u00ad\ntinctively to equipment that is ready-to-hand-namely, involvemene.xvu \nWe understand the term \"involvement\" ontologically. The kind of talk in \nwhich we say that something has with it an involvement in something, is \nnot meant to establish a fact ontically, but rather to indicate the kind of \nBeing that belongs to what is ready-to-hand. The relational character of \ninvolvement-of its 'with . . .  in . .  .'-suggests that \"an\" equipment is \nontologically impossible.

In awaiting the \n\"towards-which\", concern can at the same time come back by itself to the \nsort of thing in which it is involved. The awaiting of what it is involved in, \nand-together with this awaiting-the retaining of that which is thus \ninvolved, make possible in its ecstatical unity the specifically manipulative \nway in which equipment is made present.l \n1 'Das Gtwiirtigen des Wobei in eins mit dem Behalten des Womit der Bewandtnis \nerm()glicht in seiner ekstatischen Einheit das spezifisch hantierende Gegenwiirtigen des \nZeugs.' \n"

Letting something be \n354 \ninvolved is constituted rather in the unity of a retention which awaits, \nand it is constituted in such a manner, indeed, that the making-present \nwhich arises from this, makes possible the characteristic absorption of \nconcern in its equipmental world. When one is wholly devoted to some-\nthing and 'really' busies oneself with it, one does not do so just alongside \nthe work itself, or alongside the tool, or alongside both of them 'together'. \nThe unity of the relations in which concern circumspectively 'operates', \nhas been established already by letting-things-be-involved-which is \nbased upon temporality. \nA specific kind ofjorgetting is essential for the temporality that b con\u00ad\nstitutive for letting something be involved.

Thematical perception of Things is precisely not the way \nequipment ready-to-hand is encountered in its 'true \"in-itself\" '; it is \nencountered rather in the inconspicuousness of what we can come across \n'obviously' and 'Objectively'.

On the contrary, the tarrying which is discontinur.d when one \nmanipulates, can take on the character of a more precise kind of circum\u00ad\nspection, such as 'inspecting', checking up on what has been attained, or \nlooking over the 'operations' [\"Betrieb\"] which are now 'at a standstill'. \nHolding back from the use of equipment is so far from sheer 'theory' that \nthe kind of circumspection which tarries and 'considers', remains wholly \nin the grip of the ready-to-hand equipment with which one is concerned. \n'Practical' dealings have their own ways of tarrying. And just as praxis has \nits own specific kind of sight ('theory'), theoretical research is not without \na praxis of its own. Reading off the measurements which result from an \nexperiment often requires a complicated 'technical' set-up for the experi\u00ad\nmental design. Observation with a microscope is dependent upon the \nproduction of 'preparations'. Archaeological excavation, which precedes \nany Interpretation of the 'findings', demands manipulations of the grossest \nkind. But even in the 'most abstract' way of working out problems and \nestablishing what has been obtained, one manipulates equipment for \nwriting, for example. However 'uninteresting' and 'obvious' such com\u00ad\nponents of scientific research may be, they are by no means a matter of \nindifference ontologically. The explicit suggestion that scientific behaviour \nas a way of Being-in-the-world, is not just a 'purely intellectual activity', \nmay seem petty and superfluous. If only it were not plain from this \ntriviality that it is by no means patent where the ontological boundary \nbetween 'theoretical' and 'atheoretical' behaviour really runs ! \nSomeone will hold that all manipulation in the sciences is merely in the \n"

That which has already been laid open in awaiting and retaining \nis brought closer by one's deliberative making-present or envisaging.1 \nBut if deliberation is to be able to operate in the scheme of the 'if-then', \nconcern must already have 'surveyed' a context of involvements and have \nan understanding of it. That which is considered with an 'if' must already \nbe understood as something or other. This does not require that the under\u00ad\nstanding of equipment be expressed in a predication. The schema 'some\u00ad\nthing as something' has already been sketched out beforehand in the \nstructure of one's pre-predicative understanding. The as-structure is \ngrounded ontologically in the temporality of understanding. But on the \nother hand, only to the extent that Dasein, in awaiting some possibility \n(here this means a \"towards-which\"), has come back to a \"towards-this\" \ng6o \n(that is to say that it retains something ready-to-hand)--<>nly to this \nextent can the making-present which belongs to this awaiting and retain-\ning, start with what is thus retained, and bring it, in its character of having \nbeen assigned or referred to its \"towards-which\", explicitly closer.

The involvement-character of the ready-to-hand does not \nfirst get discovered by deliberation, but only gets brought close by it in \nsuch a manner as to let that in which something has an involvement, be \nseen ciicumspectively as this very thing. \nThe way the Present is rooted in the future and in having been, is the \nexistential-temporal condition for the possibility that what has been \nprojected in circumspective understanding can be brought closer in a \nmaking-present, and in such a way that the Present can thus conform \nitself to what is encountered within the horizon of awaiting and retaining; \nthis means that it must interpret itself in the schema of the as-structure. \nWe have thus answered the question we formulated earlier-the question \nof whether the as-structure has some existential-ontological connection \nwith the phenomenon of projection.xxll Like understanding and interpretation \nin general, the 'as' is grounded in the ecstatico-horiz;onal unity of temporality.

Only \nthat this elucidates the Situation in which circumspective concern changes \nover into theoretical discovering-a Situation of the kind which belongs \nto Dasein. We may then try to analyse this change-over itself by taking \nas our clue an elementary assertion which is circumspectively deliberative \nin character and the modifications which are possible for it. \nWhen we are using a tool circumspectively, we can say, for instance, \nthat the hammer is too heavy or too light. Even the proposition that the \nhammer is heavy can give expression to a concernful deliberation, and \nsignify that the hamer is not an easy one-in other words, that it takes \nforce to handle it, or that it wil be hard to manipulate.1 But this pro\u00ad\nposition can also mean that the entity before us, which we already know \n361 \ncircumspectively as a hammer, has a weight-that is to say, i t  has the \n'property' of heaviness : it exerts a pressure on what lies beneath it, and \nit falls if this is removed. When this kind of talk is so understood, it is no \nlonger spoken within the horizon of awaiting and retaining an equipmental \ntotality and its involvement-relationships. What is said has been drawn \nfrom looking at what is suitable for an entity with 'mass'. We have now \nsighted something that is suitable for the hammer, not as a tool, but as a \ncorporeal Thing subject to the law of gravity. To talk circumspectively of \n'too heavy' or 'too light' no longer has any 'meaning' ;  that is to say, the \nentity in itself, as we now encounter it, gives us nothing with relation to \nwhich it could be 'found' too heavy or too light. \nWhy is it that what we are talking about-the heavy hammer-shows \nitself differently when our way of talking is thus modified ? Not because \nwe are keeping our distance from manipulation, nor because we are just \nlooking away [absehen] from the equipmental character of this entity, \nbut rather because we are looking at [ansehen] the ready-to-hand thing \nwhich we encounter, and looking at it 'in a new way' as something present\u00ad\nat-hand. The understanding of Being by which our concernful dealings with \nentities within-the-world have been guided has changed over.

In existing, \nit has been thrown; and as something thrown, it has been delivered over to \nentities which it needs in order to be able to be as it is-namely, for the sake \nof itself. In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands itself in the \nway its \"for-the-sake-of-itself\" is thus connected with some current \"in\u00ad\norder-to\". That inside which existing Dasein understands itself, is 'there' \nalong with its factical existence. That inside which one primarily under\u00ad\nstands oneself has Dasein's kind of Being. Dasein is its world existingly. \nWe have defined Dasein's Being as \"care\". The ontological meaning of \n\"care\" is temporality. We have shown that temporality constitutes the \n365 \ndisclosedness of the \"there\", and we- have shown how it does so. In \nthe disclosedness of the \"there\" the world is disclosed along with it. The \nunity of significance-that is, the ontological constitution of the world\u00ad\nmust then likewise be grounded in temporality. The existential-temporal \ncondition for the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality, as an \necstatical unity, has something like a horizon. Ecstases are not simply raptures \nin which one gets carried away. Rather, there belongs to each ecstasis a \n'whither' to which one is carried away.1 This \"whither\" of the ecstasis \nwe call the \"horizonal schema\". In each of the three ecstases the ecstatical \nhorizon is different. The schema in which Dasein comes towards itself \nfuturally, whether authentically or inauthentically, is the ''for-the-sake-of\u00ad\nitself\". The schema in which Dasein is disclosed to itself in a state-of-mind \nas thrown, is to be taken as that in the face of which it has been thrown \nand that to which it has been abandoned. This characterizes the horizonal \nschema of what has been. In existing for the sake of itself in abandonment \nto itself as something that has been thrown, Dasein, as Being-alongside, \nis at the same time making present. The horizonal schema for the Present \nis defined by the \"in-order-to\". \nThe unity of the horizonal schemata of future, Present, and having \nbeen, is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality. The horizon of \ntemporality as a whole determines that whereupon [woraufhin] factically \nexisting entities are essentially disclosed. With one's factical Being-there, a \npotentiality-for-Being is in each case projected in the horizon of the \nfuture, one's 'Being-already' is disclosed in the horizon of having been, \nand that with which one concerns oneself is discovered in the horizon of \nthe Present. The horizonal unity of the schemata of these ecstases makes \npossible the primordial way in which the relationships of the \"in-order\u00ad\nto\" are connected with the \"for-the-sake-of\". This implies that on the \nbasis of the horizonal constitution of the ecstatical unity of temporality, \n1 'Die Ekstasen sind nicht einfach Entruckungen zu . . .

In so \nfar as Dasein temporalizes itself, a world is too. In temporalizing itself \nwith regard to its Being as temporality, Dasein is1 essentially 'in a world', \nby reasqn of the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of that temporality. The \nworld is neither present-at-hand nor ready-to-hand, but temporalizes \nitself in temporality. It 'is', with the \"outside-of-itself\" of the ecstases, \n'there'. If no Dasein exists, no world is 'there' either. \nThe world is already presupposed in one's Being alongside the ready-to\u00ad\nhand concernfully and factically, in one's thematizing of the present-at\u00ad\nhand, and in one's discovering of this latter entity by Objectification; that \nis to say, all these are possible only as ways of Being-in-the-world.

The fact that such entities \nare discovered along with Dasein's own \"there\" of existence, is not left \nto Dasein's discretion. Only what it discovers and discloses on occasion, in \nwhat direction it does so, how and how far it does so--only these are \nmatters for Dasein's freedom, even if always within the limitations of its \nthrownness. \nThus the significance-relationships which determine the structure of the \nworld are not a network of forms which a worldless subject has laid over \nsome kind of material. What is rather the case is that factical Dasein, \nunderstanding itself and its world ecstatically in the unity of the \"there\", \ncomes back from these horizons to the entities encountered within them. \nComing back to these entities understandingly is the existential meaning \nof letting them be encountered by making them present; that is why we \ncall them entities \"within-the-world\". The world is, as it were, already \n'further outside' than any Object can ever be. The 'problem of trans\u00ad\ncendence' cannot be brought round to the question of how a subject comes \nout to an Object, where the aggregate of Objects is identified with the idea \nof the world.

The Temporality of the Spatiality that is Characteristic of Dasein \nThough the expression 'temporality' does not signify what one under\u00ad\nstands by \"time\" when one talks about 'space and time', nevertheless \nspatiality seems to make up another basic attribute of Dasein correspond\u00ad\ning to temporality. Thus with Dasein's spatiality, existential-temporal \nanalysis seems to come to a limit, so that this entity which we call \n\"Dasein\", must be considered as 'temporal' 'and also' as spatial co\u00ad\nordinately.

Temporality is the meaning of the Being of care. \nDasein's constitution and its ways to be are possible ontologically only on \nthe basis of temporality, regardless of whether this entity occurs 'in time' \nor not. Hence Dasein's specific spatiality must be grounded in temporality. \nOn the other hand, the demonstration that this spatiality is existentially \npossible only through temporality, cannot aim either at deducing space \nfrom time or at dissolving it into pure time. If Dasein's spatiality is \n'embraced' by temporality in the sense of being existentially founded upon \nit, then this connection between them (which is to be clarified in what \nfollows) is also different from the priority of time over space in Kant's \nsense.

We must first remember in what way Dasein is \nspatial. Dasein can be spatial only as care, in the sense of existing as \nfactically falling. Negatively this means that Dasein is never present-at-\n368 \nhand in space, not even proximally. Dasein does not fil up a bit of space \nas a Real Thing or item of equipment would, so that the boundaries \ndividing it from the surrounding space would themselves just define that \nspace spatially. Dasein takes space in; this is to be understood literally.1 \nIt is by no means just present-at-hand in a bit of space which its body \nfills up. In existing, it has already made room for its own leeway. It \ndetermines its own location in such a manner that it comes back from the \nspace it has made room for to the 'place' which it has reserved. 1 To be \nable to say that Dasein is present-at-hand at a position in space, we must \nfirst take [auffassen] this entity in a way which is ontologically inappro\u00ad\npriate. Nor does the distinction between the 'spatiality' of an extended \nThing and that of Dasein lie in the fact that Dasein knows about space; \nfor taking space in [das Raum-einnehmen] is so far from identical with \na 'representing' of the spatial, that it is presupposed by it instead. Neither \nmay Dasein's spatiality be interpreted as an imperfection which adheres \nto existence by reason of the fatal 'linkage ofthe spirit to a body'. On the \ncontrary, because Dasein is 'spiritual', and onry because of this, it can be \nspatial in a way which remains essentially impossible for any extended \ncorporeal Thing. \nDasein's making room for itself is constituted by directionality and \nde-severance. How is anything of this sort existentially possible on the \n1 'Das Dasein nimmt-im wortlichen Verstande-Raum ein.' The expression 'nimmt \nRaum ein' would ordinarily be translatable as 'occupies space' or even 'takes up space'. \nBut Heidegger is here interpreting it in a way which is closer to the root meaning. \n2 'Existierend hat es sich je schon einen Spielraum eingeriiumt. Es bestinunt je seinen \neigenen Ort so, das es aus dem eingeriiumten Raum auf den \"Platz\" zuriickkommt, \nden es belegt hat.' This pasage can be read in several ways. 'Spielraum' (our 'leeway') \nmeans literally a 'space-or room-for playing'. The expresion 'belegen einen Platz' \nordinarily means to book or reserve a seat at a theatre or some other place of entertain\u00ad\nment; but in a more general and basic sense, 'belegen' (which is a word of many mean\u00ad\nings) can also mean to spread something over something else so as to 'occupy' it \ncompletely-as one spreads a slice of bread with butter or covers a wall with plaster. \nOn 'einraumen' see our note 1, p.

Whenever one comes across \nequipment, handles it, or moves it around or out of the way, some region \nhas already been discovered. Concernful Being-in-the-world is directional \n-self-directive. Belonging-somewhere has an essential relationship to \ninvolvement. It always Determines itself factically in \nterms of the \ninvolvement-context of the equipment with which one concerns oneself. \nRelationships of involvement are intelligible only within the horizon of \na world that has been disclosed. Their horizonal character, moreover, \nis what first makes possible the specific horizon of the \"whither\" of \nbelonging-somewhere regionally. The self-directive discovery of a region is \ngrounded in an ecstatically retentive awaiting of the \"hither\" and \n\"thither\" that are possible.

With regard to that space which it has ecstati\u00ad\ncally taken in, the \"here\" of its current factical situation [Lage bzw. \nSituation] never signifies a position in space, but signifies rather the \nleeway of the range of that equipmental totality with which it is most \nclosely concerned-a leeway which has been opened up for it in direc\u00ad\ntionality and de-severance. \nBringing-close makes possible the kind of handling and Being-busy \nwhich is 'absorbed in the thing one is handling' [\"in der Sache aufge\u00ad\nhende\"] ; and in such bringing-close, the essential structure of care\u00ad\nfalling-makes itself known.

Thus it comes about that if \n'observation' of entities within-the-world commences in such a making\u00ad\npresent, the illusion arises that 'at first' only a Thing is present-at-hand, \nhere of course, but indefinitely-in a space in general. \nOn{y on the basis of its ecstatico-horizonal temporality is it possible for Dasein \nto break into space. The world is not present-at-hand in space; yet only \nwithin a world does space let itself be discovered. The ecstatical tempora\u2022 \nlity of the spatiality that is characteristic of Dasein, makes it intelligible \nthat space is independent of time; but on the other hand, this same \ntemporality also makes intelligible Dasein's 'dependence' on space-a \n'dependence' which manifests itself in the well-known phenomenon that \nboth Dasein's interpretation of itself and the whole stock of significations \nwhich belong t_o language in general are dominated through and through \nby 'spatial representations'. This priority of the spatial in the Articulation \nof concepts and significations has its basis not in some specific power \nwhich space possesses, but in Dasein's kind of Being.

Our analysis of the temporality \nof concern has shown that these structures must be taken back into tempor\u00ad\nality existentially. At the very start of our analytic we did not choose as \nour theme any definite and distinctive possibility of Dasein's existence; \nour analytic was oriented rather by the average way of existing, which has \nnothing conspicuous about it.

Nor is there a sort of \nframework which this succession gradually fills up. For how is such a \nframework to be present-at-hand, where, in each case, only the Experience \none is having 'right now' is 'actual',! and the boundaries of the framework \n-the birth which is past and the death which is only oncoming-lack \nactuality ?

When, however, one tacitly regards this entity ontologically \nas something present-at-hand 'in time', any attempt at an ontological \ncharacterization of the Being 'between' birth and death will break \ndown. \nDasein does not fill up a track or stretch 'oflife'--one which is somehow \npresent-at-hand-with the phases of its momentary actualities. It stretches \nitself along in such a way that its own Being is constituted in advance as \na stretching-along. The 'between' which relates to birth and death already \nlies in the Being ofDasein.

In the same way, the processes of \n377 \nNature, whether living or lifeless, are encountered 'in time'. They are \nwithin-time. So while our analysis of how the 'time' of within-time-ness \nhas its source in temporality will be deferred until the next chapter,Ul it \nwould be easy to put this before our discussion of the connection between \nhistoricality and temporality. The historical is ordinarily characterized \nwith the help of the time of within-time-ness. But if this ordinary charac\u00ad\nterization is to be stripped of its seeming self-evidence and exclusiveness, \nhistoricality must first be 'deduced' purely in terms ofDasein's primordial \ntemporality ; this is demanded even by the way these are 'objectively' \nconnected.

But that specific character of the past \nwhich makes it something historical, does not lie in this transience,l which \ncontinues even during the Being-present-at-hand of the equipment in the \nmuseum. What, then, is past in this equipment ? What were these 'Things' \nwhich today they are no longer ? They are still definite items of equipment \nfor use; but they are out of use. Suppose, however, that they were still in \nuse today, like many a household heirloom; would they then be not yet \nhistorical ? All the same, whether they are in use or out of use, they are no \nlonger what they were. What is 'past' ? Nothing else than that world \nwithin which they belonged to a context of equipment and were en\u00ad\ncountered as ready-to-hand and used by a concernful Dasein who was-in\u00ad\nthe-world. That world is no longer. But what was formerly within-the-world \nwith respect to that world is still present-at-hand. As equipment belong\u00ad\ning to a world, that which is now still present-at-hand can belong \nnevertheless to the 'past'. But what do we signify by saying of a world that \nit is no longer ? A world is only in the manner of existing Dasein, which \nfactically i s as Being-in-the-world. 2 \nThus the historical character of the antiquities that are still preserved \nis grounded in the 'past' of that Dasein to whose world they belonged. \nBut according to this, only 'past' Dasein would be historical, not Dasein \n'in the present'. However, can Dasein be past at all, if we define 'past' as \n'now no longer either present-at-hand or ready-to-hand' ?  Manifestly, Dasein can \nnever be past, not because Dasein is non-transient, but because it essentiaily \ncan never be present-at-hand. Rather, if it is, it exists. A Dasein which no \nlonger exists, however, is not past, in the ontologically strict sense; it is \nrather \"having-been-there\" [da-gewesen]. The antiquities which are still \npresent-at-hand have a character of 'the past' and of history by reason of \nthe fact that they have belonged as equipment to a world that has been\u00ad\nthe world of a Dasein that has been there-and that they have been \nderived from that world. This Dasein is what is primarily historical. But \ndoes Dasein first become historical in that it is no longer there ? Or is it not \nhistorical precisely in so far as it factically exists ? Is Dasein just something \nthat \"has been\" in the sense of \"having been there\", or has it been as something \nfutural which is making present-that is to say, in the temporali;:.ing of its temporality? \nFrom this provisional analysis of equipment which belongs to history \nand which is still present-at-hand though somehow 'past', it becomes \nplain that such entities are historical only by reason of their belonging to \nthe world. But the world has an historical kind of Being because it makes \n1 'Vergiinglichkeit'. Cf.

This, however, only makes the enigma \nultimately more acute ; why is it that the historical is determined pre\u00ad\ndominantly by the 'past', or, to speak more appropriately, by the character \nof having-been, when that character is one that temporalizes itself \nequiprimordially with the Present and the future ? \nWe contend that what is primarily historical is Dasein.

Entities other than Dasein \nwhich are historical by reason of belonging to the world, are what we call \n'world-historical'.

No one \ndenies that at bottom human Dasein is the primary 'subject' of history ; \nand the ordinary conception of history, which we have cited, says so \nplainly enough. But with the thesis that 'Dasein is historical', one has in \nview not just the on tical Fact that in man we are presented with a more \nor less important 'atom' in the workings of world-history, and that he \nremains the plaything of circumstances and events.

We must \nnow justify this thesis, with the aim of expounding the ontological problem \nof history as an existential one. The Being of Dasein has been defined \nas care. Care is grounded in temporality. Within the range of temporality, \ntherefore, the kind of historizing which gives existence its definitely \nhistorical character, must be sought. Thus the Interpretation of Dasein's \nhistoricality will prove to be, at bottom, just a more concrete working out \nof temporality. We first revealed temporality with regard to that way of \nexisting authentically which we characterized as anticipatory resolute\u00b7 \nness. How far does this imply an authentic historizing of Dasein? \nWe have defined \"resoluteness\" as a projecting of oneself upon one's \nown Being-guilty-a projecting which is reticent and ready for anxiety.iv \nResoluteness gains its authenticity as anticipatory resoluteness.v In this, \nDasein understands itself with regard to its potentiality-for-Being, and it \ndoes so in such a manner that it will go right under the eyes of Death in \norder thus to take over in its thrownness that entity which it is itself, and \nto take it over wholly. The resolute taking over of one's factical 'there', \nsignifies, at the same time, that the Situation is one which has been \n383 \nresolved upon. In the existential analysis we cannot, in principle, discuss \nwhat Dasein factically resolves in any particular case. Our investigation \nexcludes even the existential projection of the factical possibilities of \nexistence. Nevertheless, we must ask whence, in general, Dasein can draw \nthose possibilities upon which it factically projects itself. One's anticipa\u00ad\ntory projection of oneself on that possibility of existence which is not to be \noutstripped-on death-guarantees only the totality and authenticity of \none's resoluteness. But those possibilities of existence which have been \nfactically disclosed are not to be gathered from death. And this is still less \nthe case when one's anticipation of this possibility does not signify that \none is speculating about it, but signifies precisely that one is coming back \nto one's factical \"there\". Will taking over the thrownness of the Self into \nits world perhaps disclose an horizon from which existence snatches its \nfactical possibilities away ?1 Have we not said in addition that Dasein \nnever comes back behind its thrownness ?vi Before we decide too quickly \n1 'Soil etwa die Obemahme der Geworfenheit des Selbst in seine Welt einen Horizont \nerschliesen, dem die Existenz ihre faktischen Moglichkeiten entreisst?' \n"

As thrown, it has been \nsubmitted to a 'world', and exists factically with Others. Proximally and \nfor the most part the Self is lost in the \"they\". It understands itself in \nterms of those possibilities of existence which 'circulate' in the 'average' \npublic way of interpreting Dasein today. These possibilities have mostly \nbeen made unrecognizable by ambiguity; yet they are well known to us. \nThe authentic existentiell understanding is so far from extricating itself \nfrom the way of interpreting Dasein which has come down to us, that in \neach case it is in terms of this interpretation, against it, and yet again for \nit, that any possibility one has chosen is seized upon in one's resolution. \nThe resoluteness in which Dasein comes back to itself, discloses current \nfactical possibilities of authentic existing, and discloses them in terms of the \nheritage which that resoluteness, as thrown, takes over. In one's coming back \nresolutely to one's thrownness, there is hidden a handing down to oneself of \nthe possibilities that have come down to one, but not necessarily as having \nthus come down. 1 If everything 'good' is a heritage, and the character of \n'goodness' lies in making authentic existence possible, then the handing \ndown of a heritage constitutes itself in resoluteness. The more authentically \n384 \nDasein resolves-and this means that in anticipating death it understands \nitself unambiguously in terms of its ownmost distinctive possibility-the \nmore unequivocally does it choose and find the possibility of its existence, \nand the less does it do so by accident. Only by the anticipation of death \nis every accidental and 'provisional' possibility driven out. Only Being-\nfree for death, gives Dasein its goal outright and pushes existence into \nits finitude. Once one has grasped the finitude of one's existence, it \nsnatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities which offer \nthemselves as closest to one-those of comfortableness, shirking, and \ntaking things lightly-and brings Dasein into the simplicity of its fate \n[Schicksals]. This is how we designate Dasein's primordial historizing, \nwhich lies in authentic resoluteness and in which Dasein hands itself \ndown to itself, free for death, in a possibility which it has inherited and \nyet has chosen. \n1 'Die Entschlossenheit, in der das Dasein auf sich selbst zurickkommt, erschliest die \njeweiligen faktischen Miiglichkeiten eigentlichen Existierens f!US dem Erbe, .das. sie \u009c \ngeworfene iibemimmt.

The resoluteness which comes back to itself and \nhands itself down, then becomes the repetition of a possibility of existence \nthat has come down to us. Repeating is handing down explicit[y-that is to \nsay, going back into the possibilities of the Dasein that has-been-there.1 \nThe authentic repetition of a possibility of existence that has been-the \npossibility that Dasein may choose its hero-is grounded existentially in \nanticipatory resoluteness; for it is in resoluteness that one first chooses the \nchoice which makes one free for the struggle of loyally following in the \nfootsteps of that which can be repeated. But when one has, by repetition, \nhanded down to oneself a possibility that has been, the Dasein that has\u00ad\nbeen-there is not disclosed in order to be actualized over again. The \nrepeating of that which is possible does not bring again [Wiederbringen] \nsomething that is 'past', nor does it bind the 'Present' back to that which \ng86 \nhas already been 'outstripped'.

(In the earlier editions the article 'Die', as well as \nthe words now italicized, appears in spaced type.) \nWhile we usually translate 'wiederholen' as 'repeat', this English word is hardly \nadequate to express Heidegger's meaning. Etymologically, 'wiederholen' means 'to fetch \nagain'; in modem German usage, however, this, is expressed by the cognate separable \nverb 'wieder . . .  holen', while 'wiederholen' means simply 'to repeat' or 'do over again'. \nHeidegger departs from both these meanings, as ,he is careful to point out. For him, \n'wiederholen' does not mean either a mere mechanical r\u0130petition or an attempt to recon\u00ad\nstitute the physical past; it means rather an attempt to go back to the past and retrieve \nformer possibilities, which are thus 'explicitly handed down' or 'transmitted'. \n"

In the moment \nof vision authentic existence is indifferent to both these alternatives. \nWe characterize repetition as a mode of that resoluteness which hands \nitself down-the mode by which Dasein exists explicitly as fate. But if \nfate constitutes the primordial historicality of Dasein, then history has its \nessential importance neither in what is past nor in the \"today\" and its \n'connection' with what is past, but in that authentic historizing of existence \nwhich arises from Dasein'sfuture. As a way of Being for Dasein, history has \nits roots so essentially in the future that death, as that possibility ofDasein \nwhich we have already characterized, throws anticipatory existence back \nupon its factical thrownness, and so for the first time imparts to having\u00ad\nbeen its peculiarly privileged position in the historical. Authentic Being\u00ad\ntowards-death-that is to say, the finitude of temporality-is the hidden basis of \nDasein's historicality. Dasein does not first become historical in repetition ; \nbut because it is historical as temporal, it can take itself over in its history \nby repeating. For this, no historiology is as yet needed. \nResoluteness implies handing oneself down by anticipation to the \n\"there\" of the moment of vision; and this handing down we call \"fate\". \nThis is also the ground for destiny, by which we understand Dasein's \nhistorizing in Being-with Others. In repetition, fateful destiny can be dis\u00ad\nclosed explicitly as bound up with the heritage which has come down to us. \nBy repetition, Dasein first has its own history made manifest. Historizing is \nitself grounded existentially in the fact that Dasein, as temporal, is open \necstatically; so too is the disclosedness which belongs to historizing, or \nrather so too is the way in which we make this disclosedness our own. \nThat which we have hitherto been characterizing as \"historicality\" to \nconform with the kind of historizing which lies in anticipatory resolute\u00ad\nness, we now designate as Dasein's \"authentic historicality\". From the \nphenomena of handing down and repeating, which are rooted in the \n1 'Die Wiederholung liisst sich, einem entschlosenen Sichentwerfen entspringend, \nnicht vom \"Vergangenen\" iiberreden, urn es als das vormals Wirkliche nur wieder\u00ad\nkehren zu lase.1.

Die Erwiderung der Maglichkeit im Entschluss ist aber zugleich als augenblick\u00ad\nliche der Widemlf desen, was in Heute sich als \"Vergangenheit\" auswirkt.' The idea \nseems to be that in resolute repetition one is having, as it were, a conversation with the \npast, in which the past proposes certain posibilities for adoption, but in which one makes \na rejoinder to this proposal by 'reciprocating' with the proposal of other possibilities as a \nsort of rebuke to the past, which one now disavows.

And finally, because the mean\u00ad\ning of Being in general is held to be something simply self-evident, the \nquestion about the kind of Being of the world-historical and about the \nmovement of historizing in general has 'really' just the barren circum\u00ad\nstantiality of a verbal sophistry. \nEveryday Dasein has been dispersed into the many kinds of things \nwhich daily 'come to pass'.

The possibility that this horizon for the question \nshould be the dominant one is grounded in the irresoluteness which goes \nto make up the essence of the Self's in-constancy. \nWe have thus pointed out the source of the question of the 'connected\u00ad\nness' of Daein in the sense of the unity with which Experiences are \nlinked together between birth and death. At the same time, the origin of \nthis question betrays that it is an inappropriate one if we are aiming at a \nprimordial existential Interpretation of Dasein's totality of historizing. On \nthe other hand, despite the predominance of this 'natural' horizon for such \nquestions, it becomes explicable why Dasein's authentic historicality\u00ad\nfate and repetition-looks as if it, least of all, could supply the phenomenal \nbasis for bringing into the shape of an ontologically grounded problem \nwhat is at bottom intended in the question of the 'connectedness' oflife. \nThis question does not ask how Dasein gains such a unity of connected\u00ad\nness that the sequence of 'Experiences' which has ensued and is still \nensuing can subsequently be linked together ; it asks rather in which of its \nown kinds of Being Dasein loses itself in such a manner1 that it must, as it were, \nonly subsequently pull itself together out of its dispersal, and think up for itself a \nuniry in which that \"together\" is embraced.

As \nresoluteness which is ready for anxie9J, this loyalty is at the same time a \npossible way of revering the sole authority which a free existing can have \n-of revering the repeatable possibilities of existence. Resoluteness would \nbe misunderstood ontologically if one were to suppose that it would be \nactual as 'Experience' only as long as the 'act' of resolving 'lasts'. In \nresoluteness lies the existentiell constancy which, by its very essence, has \nalready anticipated [ vorweggenommen] every possible moment of vision \nthat may arise from it. As fate, resoluteness is freedom to give up some \ndefinite resolution, and to give it up in accordance with the demands of \nsome possible Situation or other. The steadiness of.existence is not inter\u00ad\nrupted thereby but confirmed in the moment of vision.

On the other hand, the temporality of \nauthentic historicality, as the moment of vision of anticipatory repetition, \n'Stitigkeit', which we here translate as 'steadines', may mean either 'continuity' or \n'refractoriness'. Heidegger may have both senses in mind. Cf. our note g, p. 475, H. 423 \nbelow. \n1 'Mit diesem Sichiiberliefem des Erbes aber ist dann die \"Geburt\" im Zurickkommen \naus der uniiberholbaren Mt>glichkeit des Todes in die Existent tinge/wit, damit diese \ntteilich nur die Geworfenheit des eigenen Da illusionsfreier hinnehme.' Here as in H. 307 \nand perhaps in H. 302, Heidegger seems to be exploiting the double meaning of 'ein\u00ad\nholen' as 'to bring in' and 'to catch up with'. Dasem 'brings' its birth 'into' its existence \nby accepting its heritage of possibilities, and in this way it 'catches up with it'. Thus while \ndeath cannot be outstripped ('iiberholt'), birth can at least be 'caught up with' ('einge\u00ad\nholt'). \n"

But historiology still has \nDasein's historicality as its presupposition in its own quite special way. \nThis can be made plain, in the first instance, by the suggestion that \nhistoriology, as the science of Dasein's history, must 'presuppose' as its \npossible 'Object' the entity which is primordially historical. But history must \nnot only be, in order that a historiological object may become accessible; \nand historiological cognition is not only historical, as a historizing way in \nwhich Dasein comports itself. Whether the historiological disclosure of history \nis factically accomplished or not, its ontological structure is such that in itself \nthis disclosure has its roots in the historicality of Dasein.

The 'selection' of what is to become a possible \nobject for historiology has already been met with in the factical existentiell \nchoice of Dasein's historicality, in which historiology first of all arises, and \nin which alone it is. \nThe historiological disclosure of the 'past' is based on fateful repetition, \nand is so far from 'subjective' that it alone guarantees the 'Objectivity' \nof historiology. For the Objectivity of a science is regulated primarily in \nterms of whether that science can confront us with the entity which \nbelongs to it as its theme, and can bring it, uncovered in the primordiality \nof its Being, to our understanding. In no science are the 'universal validity' \nof standards and the claims to 'universality' which the \"they\" and its \ncommon sense demand, less possible as criteria of 'truth' than in authentic \nhistoriology. \nOnly because in each case the central theme of historiology is the \npossibility of existence which has-been-there, and because the latter exists \nfactically in a way which is world-historical, can it demand of itself that \nit takes its orientation inexorably from the 'facts'. Accordingly this \nresearch as factical has many branches and takes for its object the history \nof equipment, of work, of culture, of the spirit, and of ideas. As handing \nitself down, history is, in itself, at the same time and in each case always \nin an interpretedness which belongs to it, and which has a history of its \nown; so for the most part it is only through traditional history that \n\u2022 1.

Where any one point of \nview predominates, the others are the motives and the means. What looks \nlike disunity and an unsure, 'haphazard' way of 'trying things out', is an \nelemental restlessness, the one goal of which is to understand 'life' philo\u00ad\nsophically and to secure for this understanding a hermeneutical founda\u00ad\ntion in terms of 'life itself'.

And this \nin turn is possible only because, as something which in itself is ecstatically \nopen, it has in each case been disclosed to itself already and can be \nArticulated in the kind of interpretation which is accompanied by under\u00ad\nstanding and discourse. Because temporality is ecstatico-horizonally constitutive \nfor the clearedness of the \"there\", temporality is always primordially interpretable \nin the \"there\" and is accordingly familiar to us. The making-present which \ninterprets itself-in other words, that which has been interpreted and is \naddressed in the 'now'-is what we call 'time'. This simply makes known \nto us that temporality-which, as ecstatically open, is recognizable-is \nfamiliar, proximally and for the most part, only as interpreted in this \nconcernful manner.1 But while time is 'immediately' intelligible and \nrecognizable, this does not preclude the possibility that primordial \ntemporality as such may remain unknown and unconceived, and that this \nis also the case with the source of the time which has been expressed-a \nsource which temporalizes itself in that temporality. \nThe fact that the structure of datability belongs essentially to what has \nbeen interpreted with the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former \noccasion', becomes the most elemental proof that what has thus been \ninterpreted has originated in the temporality which interprets itself. \nWhen we say 'now', we always understand a 'now that so and \n1 'Das sich auslegende Gegenwiirtigen, das heisst das im \"jetzt\" angesprochene Aus\u00ad\ngelegte nennen wir \"Zeit\". Darin bekundet sich lediglich, dass die Zeitlichkeit, als \nekstatisch offene kenntlich, zunachst und zumeist nur in dieser besorgenden Ausgelegtheit \nbekannt ist.' The older editions have 'ausgesprochenc' ('expressed') rather than 'anges\u00ad\nprochene' ('addresed') ; the comma after 'Zeitlichkeit' is missing, and the particle \u030fa' \nappears just before 'zunachst'. \n"

' lies the ecstatical character \nof the Present. The datability of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that \nformer occasion', reflects the ecstatical constitution of temporality, and is \ntherefore essential for the time itself that has been expressed. The structure \nof the datability of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former occasion', \nis evidence that these, stemming from temporality, are themselves time. The \ninterpretative expressing of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former \noccasion', is the most primordial way of assigning a time. 2 In the ecstatical \nunity of temporality-which gets understood along with datability, but \nunthematically and without being recognizable as such-Dasein has \nalready been disclosed to itself as Being-in-the-world, and entities within\u00ad\nthe-world have been discovered along with it; because of this, interpreted \ntime has already been given a dating in terms of those entities which are \nencountered in the disclosedness of the \"there\" : \"now that-the door \nslams\" ; \"now that-my book is missing\", and so forth. 3 \nThe horizons which belong to the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that \nformer occasion', all have their source of ecstatical temporality; by reason \nof this, these horizons too have the character of datability as 'today, \n409 \nwhen . .  .', 'later on, when . . .  ', and 'earlier, when . .  .'' \nIf awaiting understands itself in the 'then' and interprets itself, and \nthereby, as making present, understands that which it awaits, and under\u00ad\nstands this in terms of its 'now', then the 'and-now-not-yet' is already \nimplied when we 'assign' a 'then'. The awaiting which makes present \nunderstands the 'until-then'. This 'until-then' is Articulated by inter\u00ad\npretation : it 'has its time' as the \"in-between\", which likewise has a relation\u00ad\nship of datability. This relationship gets expressed in the 'during-this' or \n'meanwhile' [\"wahrend dessen . .  .'']. The 'during' can itself be Articulated \nawaitingly by concern, by assigning some more 'thens'. The 'until\u00ad\nthen' gets divided up by a number of 'from-then-till-thens', which, how\u00ad\never, have been 'embraced' beforehand in awaitingly projecting the \nprimary 'then'. 'Enduring' gets Articulated in the understanding one has \n1 '  \"Jetzt\"-sagend verstehen wir iinmer auch schon, ohne es mitzusagen, ein \"-da \ndas und das . . .

The earlier editions \nhave 'sie' instead of 'diese'. (While we have generally tried to reserve the verb 'assign' for \nverbs such as 'verweisen' and 'zuweisen', it is convenient to use it in this chapter to \ntranslate such expressions as 'angeben', 'Angabe', and 'Zeitangabe'.) \n8 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  jetzt, da--die Tiir schlagt; jetzt, da-mir das Buch fehlt, und dergleichen.' While \nthe phrase 'jetzt' da . .  .' ordinarily means 'now that . .  .', Heidegger here seems to be \ninterpreting it with an illusion to the 'da' which we have usually translated as 'there'\u00ad\nthe 'da' of 'Dasein'. \n4.

The making-present which awaits \nand retains, lays 'out' a 'during' with a span, only because it has thereby \ndisclosed itself as the way in which its historical temporality has been \necstatically stretched along, even though it does not know itself as this. 2 But \nhere a further peculiarity of the time which has been 'assigned' shows \nitself. Not only does the 'during' have a span ; but every 'now', 'then', and \n'on that former occasion' has, with its datability-structure, its own \nspanned character, with the width of the span varying : 'now'-in the \nintermission, while one is eating, in the evening, in summer ; 'then'-at \nbreakfast, when one is taking a climb, and so forth. \nThe concern which awaits, retains, and makes present, is one which \n'allows itself' so much time ; and it assigns itself this time concernfully, even \nwithout determining the time by any specific reckoning, and before any \nsuch reckoning has been done. Here time dates itself in one's current mode \nof allowing oneself time concernfully; and it does so in terms of those very \nmatters with which one concerns oneself environmentally, and which have \nbeen disclosed in the understanding with its accompanying state-of-mind \n-in terms of what one does 'all day long'. The more Dasein is awaitingly \nabsorbed in the object of its concern and forgets itself in not awaiting \nitself, the more does even the time which it 'allows' itself remain covered up \nby this way of 'allowing'. When Dasein is 'living along' in an everyday \nconcernful manner, it just never understands itself as running along in a \nContinuously enduring sequence of pure 'nows'. By reason of this covering \nup, the time which Dasein allows itself has gaps in it, as it were. Often \nwe do not bring a 'day' together again when we come back to the time \n41 0  \nwhich we have 'used'. But the time which has gaps in it does not go to \npieces in this lack-of-togetherness, which is rather a mode of that \ntemporality which has already been disclosed and stretched along ecstatically. \nThe manner in which the time we have 'allowed' 'runs its course', and the \nway in which concern more or less explicitly assigns itself that time, can \nbe properly explained as phenomena only if, on the one hand, we avoid \nl 'Mit dem gewiirtigend-gegenwiirtigenden Verstehen des \"wiihrend\" wird das \n\"Wiihren\" artikuliert.' 'Wiihren' of course means 'enduring' in the sense of lasting or \ncontinuing, not in that of 'suffering' or 'tolerating'. \n2 'Das gewiirtigend-behaltende Gegenwiirtigen legt nur deshalb ein gespanntes \n\"wiihrend\" \"aus\", wei! es dabei sich als die ekstatische Erstrecktheit der geschichtlichen \nZeitlichkeit, wenngleich als solche unerkannt, erschlossen ist.' Our translation of 'ges\u00ad\npanntes' as 'with a span' preserves the connection with 'Spanne' but misses the connotation \nof 'tenseness', which Heidegger clearly has in mind elsewhere (e.g. H. 261 f., 374) and is \nsurely suggesting here. The pun on 'auslegen' ('interpret') and 'legt . . .  \"aus\" ' ('lays \n\"out\" ') also disappears in translation. \n"

According to that characteriza\u00ad\ntion, the irresoluteness of inauthentic existence temporalizes itself in the \nmode of a making-present which does not await but forgets.

Busily losing himself in the \nobject of his concern, he loses his time in it too. Hence his characteristic way \nof talking-'! have no time'. But just as he who exists inauthentically is \nconstantly losing time and never 'has' any, the temporality of authentic \nexistence remains distinctive in that such existence, in its resoluteness, \nnever loses time and 'always has time'. For the temporality of resoluteness \nhas, with relation to its Present, the character of a moment of vision.

But resoluteness discloses the \"there\" in \nthis way only as a Situation. So if he who is resolute encounters anything \nthat has been disclosed, he can never do so in such a way as to lose his \ntime on it irresolutely. \nThe ''there'' is disclosed in a way which is grounded in Dasein's own temporality \nas ecstatically stretched along, and with this disclosure a 'time' is allotted to Dasein; \nonly because of this can Dasein, as factically thrown, 'take' its time and lose it. \nAs something disclosed, Dasein exists factically in the way of Being with \nOthers. It maintains itself in an intelligibility which is public and average. \nWhen the 'now that . . .  ' and the 'then when . . .

The Time with which we Concern Ourselves, and Within-time-ness \nSo far we have only had to understand provisionally how Dasein, as \ngrounded in temporality, is, in its very existing, concerned with times \nand how, in such interpretative concern, time makes itself public for \nBeing-in-the-world. But the sense in which time 'is' if it is of the kind \nwhich is public and has been expressed, remains completely undefined, \nif indeed such time can be considered as being at all. Before we can make \nany decision as to whether public time is 'merely subjective' or 'Objec\u00ad\ntively actual', or neither of these, its phenomenal character must first \nbe determined more precisely. \nWhen time is made public, this does not happen just occasionally and \nsubsequently. On the contrary, because Dasein, as something ecstatico\u00ad\ntemporal, is already disclosed, and because understanding and interpreta\u00ad\ntion both belong to existence, time has already made itself public in \nconcern. One directs oneself according to it, so that it must somehow be the \nsort of thing which Everyman can come across. \nAlthough one can concern oneself with time in the manner which we \nhave characterized-namely, by dating in terms of environmental events \n-this always happens basically within the horizon of that kind of concern \nwith time which we know as astronomical and calendrical time-reckoning. \nSuch reckoning does not occur by accident, but has its existential-onto\u00ad\nlogical necessity in the basic state of Dasein as care. Because it is essential \nto Dasein that it exists fallingly as something thrown, it interprets its \ntime concernfully by way of time-reckoning. In this, the 'real' making-\n\u2022P 2 \npublic of time gets temporalized, so that we must say that Dasein's thrownness \nis the reason why 'there is' time publicly.1 If we are to demonstrate that public \ntime has its source in factical temporality, and if we are to assure ourselves \nthat this demonstration is as intelligible as possible, the time which has \nbeen interpreted in the temporality of concern must first be characterized, \nI 'In ihr zeitigt sich die \"eigentliche\" Veroffentlichung der Zeit, sodas gesagt werden \nmus : die Geworfenheit des Daseins ist der Grund dafiir, dass es Ojfentlich Zeit \"gibt\".' Heidegger's \nquotation marks around 'gibt' suggest an intentional pun which would permit the alter\u00ad\nnative translation: ' . . .  the reason why Dasein \"gives\" time publicly.' \n"

Concernful awaiting takes precau\u00ad\ntion to define the 'thens' with which it is to concern itself-that is, to \ndivide up the day. And the 'during-the-daytime' makes this possible. \nThis dividing-up, in turn, is done with regard to that by which time is \ndated-the journeying sun. Sunset and midday, like the sunrise itself, \nare distinctive 'places' which this heavenly body occupies. Its regularly \nrecurring passage is something which Dasein, as thrown into the world \nand giving itself time temporalizingly, takes into its reckoning. Dasein \nhistorizesfrom day to day by reason of its way of interpreting time by dating \nit-a way which is adumbrated in its thrownness into the \"there\". \nThis dating of things in terms of the heavenly body which sheds forth \nlight and warmth, and in terms of its distinctive 'places' in the sky, is a \nway of assigning time which can be done in our Being with one another \n'under the same sky', and which can be done for 'Everyman' at any time \nin the same way, so that within certain limits everyone is proximally agreed \nupon it. That by which things are thus dated is available environmentally \nand yet not restricted to the world of equipment with which one currently \nconcerns oneself. It is rather the case that in the world the environing \nNature and the public environment are always discovered along with it.fi \nThis public dating, in which everyone assigns himself his time, is one which \neveryone can 'reckon' on simultaneously; it uses a publicly available \nmeasure. This dating reckons with time in the sense of a measuring of time; \nand such measuring requires something by which time is to be measured \n-namely, a clock. This implies that along with the temporality of Dasein as \nthrown, abandoned to the 'world', and giving itself time, something like a 'clock' \nis also discovered-that is, something ready-to-hand which in its regular recurrence \nhas become accessible in one's making present awaitingry. The Being which has \nbeen thrown and is alongside the ready-to-hand is grounded in temporality. \nTemporality is the reason for the clock. As the condition for the pos\u00ad\nsibility that a clock is factically necessary, temporality is likewise the \ncondition for its discoverability. For while the course of the sun is encoun\u00ad\ntered along with the discoveredness of entities within-the-world, it is only \nby making it present in awaitingly retaining, and by doing so in a way \nwhich interprets itself, that dating in terms of what is ready-to-hand \nenvironmentally in a public way is made possible and is also required. \nDasein has its basis in temporality, and the 'natural' clock which has \nalready been discovered along with Dasein's factical thrownness furnishes \n414 \nthe first motivation for the production and use of clocks which will be \nsomewhat more handy ; it also makes this possible.

If the time with which we concern ourselves is 'really' \nmade public only when it gets measured, then if public time is to be acces\u00ad\nsible in a way which has been phenomenally unveiled, we must have access \nto it by following up the way in which that which has been dated shows \nitself when dated in this 'reckoning' manner. \nWhen the 'then' which interprets itself in concernful awaiting gets dated, \nthis dating includes some such statement as \"then-when it dawns-it is \ntime for one's daily work\". The time which is interpreted in concern is \nalready understood as a time for something. The current 'now that so \nand so . .  .' is as such either appropriate or inappropriate. Not only is the 'now' \n(and so too any mode of interpreted time) a 'now that \n. .  .' which is \nessentially datable ; but as such it has essentially, at the same time, the \nstructure of appropriateness or inappropriateness. Time which has been \ninterpreted has by its very nature the character of 'the time for something' \nor 'the wrong time for something' .1 When concern makes present by \nawaiting and retaining, time is understood in relation to a \"for-which\" ;2 \nand this in turn is ultimately tied up with a \"for-the-sake-of-which\" of \nDasein's potentiality-for-Being. With this \"in-order-to\" relation, the time \nwhich has been made public makes manifest that structure with which \nwe have earlierlll become acquainted as significance, and which constitutes \nthe worldhood of the world. As 'the time for something', the time which has \nbeen made public has essentially a world-character. Hence the time which \nmakes itself public in the temporalizing of temporality is what we desig\u00ad\nnate as \"world-time\". And we designate it thus not because it is present\u00ad\nat-hand as an entity within-the-world (which it can never be), but because it \nbelongs to the world [zur Welt] in the sense which we have Interpreted \nexistential-ontologically. In the following pages we must show how the \nessential relations of the world-structure (the 'in-order-to', for example) 'are \nconnected with public time (the 'then, when . .  .', for example) by reason \nof the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of temporality.

As time-reckoning is perfected and the use \nof clocks becomes more refined, this making-public gets enhanced and \nstrengthened. We shall not give here a historiological presentation of the \nhistorical evolution of time-reckoning and the use of clocks, with all its \npossible variations. We must rather ask in an existential-ontological way \nwhat mode of the temporalizing ofDasein's temporality becomes manifest \nin the direction which the development of time-reckoning and clock-using \nhas taken. When this question is answered, there must arise a more prim\u00ad\nordial understanding of the fact that the measurement of time-and this \nmeans also the explicit making-public of time as an object of concern-is \ngrounded in the temporality of Dasein, and indeed in a quite definite tem\u00ad\nporalizing of that temporality. \nComparison shows that for the 'advanced' Dasein the day and the \npresence of sunlight no longer have such a special function as they have \nfor the 'primitive' Dasein on which our analysis of 'natural' time-reckon\u00ad\ning has been based ; for the 'advanced' Dasein has the 'advantage' of \neven being able to turn night into day. Similarly we no longer need to \nglance explicitly and immediately at the sun and its position to ascertain \nthe time. The manufacture and use of measuring-equipment of one's \nown permits one to read off the time directly by a clock produced espec\u00ad\nially for this purpose. The \"what o'clock is it?\" is the 'what time is it ?' \nBecause the clock-in the sense of that which makes possible a public way \nof time-reckoning-must be regulated by the 'natural' clock, even the \nuse of clocks as equipment is based upon Dasein's temporality, which, \nwith the disclosedness of the \"there\", first makes possible a dating of the \ntime with which we concern ourselves; this is a fact, even if it is covered \nup when the time is read off. Our understanding of the natural clock \ndevelops with the advancing discovery of Nature, and instructs us as to new \npossibilities fora kind of time-measurement which is relatively independent \nof the day and of any explicit observation of the sky. \nBut in a certain manner even 'primitive' Dasein makes itself in\u00ad\ndependent of reading off the time directly from the sky, when instead of \nascertaining the sun's position it measures the shadow cast by some entity \n41 6  \navailable at any time. This can happen in the first instance in the simplest \nform of the ancient 'peasant's clock'. Everyman is constantly accompanied \n"

Measuring time is essentially such that it is \nnecessary to say \"now\" ; but in obtaining the measurement, we, as it \nwere, forget what has been measured as such, so that nothing is to be \nfound except a number and a stretch. \nWhen Dasein concerns itself with time, then the less time it has to lose, \nthe more 'precious' does that time become, and the handier the clock must \nbe. Not only should we be able to assign the time 'more precisely', but the \nvery determining of the time should claim as little time as possible, though \nit must still agree with the ways in which Others assign time. \nProvisionally it was enough for us to point out the general 'connection' \nof the use of clocks with that temporality which takes its time. Just as the \nconcrete analysis of astronomical time-reckoning in its full development \nbelongs to the existential-ontological Interpretation of how Nature is \ndiscovered, the foundations ofhistoriological and calendrical 'chronology' \ncan be laid bare only within the orbit of the tasks of analysing historio\u00ad\nlogical cognition existentially.v \nThe measurement of time gives it a marked public character, so that \n419 \nonly in this way does what we generally call 'the time' become well known. \nIn concern every Thing has 'its time' attributed to it. It 'has' it, and, like \nevery entity within-the-world, it can 'have' it only because after all it is \n'in time'. That time 'wherein' entities within-the-world are encountered, \nwe know as \"world-time\". By reason of the ecstatico-horizonal con\u00ad\nstitution of the temporality which belongs to it, this has the same \ntranscendence as the world itself. With the disclosedness of the world, \nworld-time has been made public, so that every temporally concernfulBeing \nalongside entities within-the-world understands these entities circumspec-\ntively as encountered 'in time'. \nThe time 'in which' the present-at-hand is in motion or at rest is \nnot 'Objective', if what we mean by that is the Being-present-at-hand-in\u00ad\nitself of entities encountered within-the-world. But just as little is time \n'subjective', if by this we understand Being-present-at-hand and occur\u00ad\nring in a 'subject'. World-time is 'more Objective' than any possible Object \nbecause, with the disclosedness of the world, it already becomes 'Objectified' in an \necstatico-horizonal manner as the condition for the possibility of entities within-the\u00ad\nWorld. Thus, contrary to Kant's opinion, one comes across world-time \njust as immediately in the physical as in the psychical, and not just \nroundabout by way of the psychical. 'Time' first shows itself in the \nsky-precisely where one comes across it when one regulates oneself \n"

That which gets \ncounted when one measures time concernfully, the \"now\", gets co-under-\nstood in one's concern with the present-at-hand and the ready-to-hand. \nNow so far as this concern with time comes back to the time itself which \nhas been co-understood, and in so far as it 'considers' that time, it sees the \n\"nows\" (which indeed are also somehow 'there') within the horizon of that \nunderstanding-of-Being by which this concern is itself constantly guided.1x \n42 3 \nThus the \"nows\" are in a certain manner co-present-at-hand: that is, entities \nare encountered, and so too is the \"now\". Although it is not said explicitly \nthat the \"nows\" are present-at-hand in the same way as Things, they still \nget 'seen' ontologically within the horizon of the idea of presence-at-hand. \nThe \"nows\" pass away, and those which have passed away make up the \npast. The \"nows\" come along, and those which are coming along define the \n'future'. The ordinary interpretation of world-time as now-time never \navails itself of the horizon by which such things as world, significance, \nand datability can be made accessible. These structures necessarily remain \ncovered up, all the more so because this covering-up is reinforced by the \nway in which the ordinary interpretation develops its characterization of \ntime conceptually. \nThe sequence of \"nows\" is taken as something that is somehow present\u00ad\nat-hand, for it even moves ' i nto time'.1 We say : 'In every \"now\" is now; \nin every \"now\" it is already vanishing.' In every \"now\" the \"now\" is now \nand therefore it constantly has presence as something selfsame, even though \nin every \"now\" another may be vanishing as it comes along.11 Yet as this \nthing which changes, it simultaneously shows its own constant presence. \nThus even Plato, who directed his glance in this manner at time as a \nsequence of \"nows\" arising and passing away, had to call time \"the \nimage of eternity\" : \u00a3lKw 8' l7T\u00a3von KW1JTOV T\u00a3va alwvos 7Totfjaat, Kai \n8taKoap.Wv ttp.a ovpaVOV 7TO\u00a3\u00a3\u00f2 p.JvoVTOS alclJvos Jv Jv/.

From temporality the full structure of world-time has been drawn ; \nand only the Interpretation of this structure gives us the clue for 'seeing' \nat all that in the ordinary conception of time something has been covered \nup, and for estimating how much the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of \ntemporality has been levelled off. This orientation by Dasein's temporality \nindeed makes it possible to exhibit the origin and the factical necessity of \nthis levelling off and covering up, and at the same time to test the argu\u00ad\nments for the ordinary theses about time. \nOn the other hand, within the horizon of the way time is ordinarily \nunderstood, temporality is inaccessible in the reverse direction.1 Not only must \nthe now-time be oriented primarily by temporality in the order of possible \ninterpretation, but it temporalizes itself only in the inauthentic tempor\u00ad\nality of Dasein ; so if one has regard for the way the now-time is derived \nfrom temporality, one is justified in considering temporality as the time \nwhich is primordial. \nEcstatico-horizonal temporality temporalizes itself primarily in terms of \nthe future. In the way time is ordinarily understood, however, the basic \nphenomenon of time is seen in the \"now\", and indeed in that pure \"now\" \nwhich has been shorn in its full structure-that which they call the 'Pre-\n427 \nsent'. One can gather from this that there is in principle no prospect that \nin terms of this kind of \"now\" one can clarify the ecstatico-horizonal pheno\u00ad\nmenon of the moment of vision which belongs to temporality, or even that \none can derive it thus. Correspondingly, the future as ecstatically under\u00ad\nstood-the datable and significant 'then'-does not coincide with the \nordinary conception of the 'future' in the sense of a pure \"now\" which \nhas not yet come along but is only coming along. And the concept of the \npast in the sense of the pure \"now\" which has passed away, is just \nas far from coinciding with the ecstatical \"having-been\"-the datable \nand significant 'on a former occasion'. The \"now\" is not pregnant with \nthe \"not-yet-now\", but the Present arises from the future in the prim-\nordial ecstatical unity of the temporalizing of temporality.xili \nAlthough, proximally and for the most part, the ordinary experience of \ntime is one that knows only 'world-time', it always gives it a distinctive \nrelationship to 'soul' and 'spirit', even if this is still a far cry from a \nphilosophical inquiry oriented explicitly and primarily towards the \n'subject'. As evidence for this, two characteristic passages will suffice. \nAristotle says : \u00a3l 8\u20ac p:ry8\u20acv aAAO 1TlcpvK\u00a3V ci.pdJp.\u00a3'iV P ,PvxQ Ka\u00ef .fvxfjs voiJs, \nci.MvaTOV \u00a3lva\u00a3 xpovov .fvxfjs f-LQ OVUTJS\u00b7 \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n XIV And Saint Augustine writes : \n1 'Dagegen bleibt umgekehrt die Zeitlichkeit im Horizont des vulgiiren Zeitverstand\u00ad\nnisses un;;ugiinglich.' \n"

And Hegelhasmadean explicit attempt to set forth the way \nin which time as ordinarily understood is connected with spirit. In Kant, \non the other hand, while time is indeed 'subjective', it stands 'beside' \n428 \nthe 'I think' and is not bound up with it.xvt The grounds which Hegel has \nexplicitly provided for the connection between time and spirit are well \nsuited to elucidate indirectly the foregoing Interpretation of Dasein as \ntemporality and our exhibition of temporality as the source of world\u00ad\ntime. \n\u0101 82. A Comparison of the Existential-ontological Connection of Temporality, \nDasein, and World-time, with Hegel's Way of Taking the Relation between Time \nand Spirit \nHistory, which is essentially the history of spirit, runs its course 'in \ntime'. Thus 'the development of history falls into time' .xvii l Hegel is not \nsatisfied, however, with averring that the within-time-ness of spirit is a \nFact, but seeks to understand how it is possible for spirit to fall into time, \nwhich is 'the non-sensuous sensuous'.xvtu Time must be able, as it were, \nto take in spirit. And spirit in turn must be akin to time and its essence. \nAccordingly two points come up for discussion : (r) how does Hegel define \nthe essence of time ? ( 2) what belongs to the essence of spirit which makes \nit possible for it to 'fall into time' ? Our answer to these questions will serve \nmerely to elucidate our Interpretation of Dasein as temporality, and to do \nso by way of a comparison. We shall make no claim to give even a relatively \nfull treatment of the allied problems in Hegel, especially since 'criticizing' \nhim will not help us. Because Hegel's conception of time presents the most \nradical way in which the ordinary understanding of time has been given \nform conceptually, and one which has received too little attention, \na comparison of this conception with the idea of temporality which we \nhave expounded is one that especially suggests itself. \n(a) Hegel's Conception of Time \nWhen a philosophical Interpretation of time is carried out, it gets a \n'locus in a system' ; this locus may be considered as criteria! for the basic \nway of treating time by which such an Interpretation is guided. In the \n1 'Also fallt die Entwicklung der Geschichte in die Zeit\".' Throughout this section it \nwill be convenient to translate Hegel's verb 'fallen' by 'fall', though elsewhere we have \nlargely pre-empted this for Heidegger's 'verfallen'. 'Verfallen' does not appear until H. \n436, where we shall call attention to it explicitly. (In this quotation, as in several others, \nHeidegger has taken a few minor liberties with Hegel's text, which are too trivial for any \nspecial comment.) \n"

'Time', 'location', and 'movement' \nstand together. True to tradition, Hegel's analysis of time has its locus \n429 \nin the second part of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, which is \nentitled 'Philosophy ofNature'. The first portion of this treats of mechanics, \nand of this the first division is devoted to the discussion of 'space and time'. \nHe calls these 'the abstract \"outside-of-one-another\" \u2022.xtx \nThough Hegel puts space and time together, this does not happen \nsimply because he has arranged them superficially one after the other: \nspace, 'and time also'. 'Philosophy combats such an \"also\".' The transition \nfrom space to time does not signify that these are treated in adjoining \nparagraphs ; rather 'it is space itself that makes the transition'.1 Space 'is' \ntime ; that is, time is the 'truth' of space.xx If space is thought dialectically \nin that which it is, then according to Hegel this Being of space unveils itself \nas time. How must space be thought ? \nSpace is 'the unmediated indifference of Nature's Being-outside-of\u00ad\nitself'.xxi This is a way of saying that space is the abstract multiplicity \n[Vielheit] of the points which are differentiable in it.2 Space is not \ninterrupted by these; but neither does it arise from them by way of \njoining them together. Though it is differentiated by differentiable points \nwhich are space themselves, space remains, for its part, without any \ndifferences. The differences themselves are of the same character as that \nwhich they differentiate. Nevertheless, the point, in so far as it differen-\ntiates anything ir:t space, is the negation of space, though in such a manner \nthat, as this negation, it itself remains in space ; a point is space after all. \nThe point does not lift itself out of space as if it were something of another \ncharacter. Space is the \"outside-of-one-another\" of the multiplicity of \npoints [Punktmannigfaltigkeit] , and it is without any differences. But it \nis not as if space were a point ; space is rather, as Hegel says, 'punctuality' \n[\"Punktualitat\"] . xxu This is the basis for the sentence in which Hegel \nthinks of space in its truth-that is, as time : 'Negativity, which relates \nitself as point to space, and which develops in space its determinations as \nline and surface, is, however, just as muchfor itself in the sphere of Being\u00ad\noutside-of-itself, and so are its determinations therein, though while it is \n430 \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n sondern \"der Raum selbst geht uber\".' \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 in ihm unterscheidbaren Punkte.' We have often translated 'unterscheiden' as \n'distinguish' or 'discriminate', and 'Unterschied' as 'distinction' or 'difference', leaving \n'differentiate' and 'differentiation' for such words as 'differenzieren' and 'Differenz', etc. \nIn this discussion of Hegel, however, it will be convenient to translate 'unterscheiden' as \n'differentiate', 'Unterschied' as 'difference', 'unterscheidbar' as 'differentiable', 'unter\u00ad\nschiedslos' as 'without differences'. (We shall continue to translate 'gleichgilltig as 'in\u00ad\ndifferent'.) \n"

As thus posited for itself, \nit is time:xxm \nIf space gets represented-that is, if it gets intuited immediately in the \nindifferent subsistence of its differences-then the negations are, as it were, \nsimply given. But by such a representation, space does not get grasped in \nits Being. Only in thinking is it possible for this to be done-in thinking as \nthe synthesis which has gone through thesis and antithesis and transmuted \nthem. Only if the negations do not simply remain subsisting in their \nindifference but get transmuted-that is, only if they themselves get \nnegated--does space get thought and thus grasped in its Being. In the \nnegation of the negation (that is, of punctuality) the point posits itself \nfor itself and thus emerges from the indifference of subsisting. As that which \nis posited for itself, it differentiates itself from this one and from that one : \nit is no longer this and not yet that. In positing itself for itself, it posits the \nsuccession in which it stands-the sphere of Being-outside-of-itself, which \nis by now the sphere of the negated negation. When punctuality as \nindifference gets transmuted, this signifies that it no longer remains lying \nin the 'paralysed tranquillity of space'. The point 'gives itself airs' before \nall the other points. 1 According to Hegel, this negation of the negation \nas punctuality is time. If this discussion has any demonstrable meaning, \nit can mean nothing else than that the positing-of-itself-for-itself of every \npoint is a \"now-here\", \"now-here\", and so on. Every point 'is' posited \nfor itself as a now-point. 'In time the point thus has actuality.' That \nthrough which each point, as this one here, can posit itself for itself, is in \neach case a \"now\". The \"now\" is the condition for the possibility of the \npoint's positing itself for itself. This possibility-condition makes up th< \nBeing of the point, and Being is the same as having been thought. Thus \nin each case the pure thinking of punctuality-that is, of space-'thinks' \nthe \"now\" and the Being-outside-of-itself of the \"now\" ; because of this, \nspace 'is' time. How is time itself defined ? \n'Time, as the negative unity of Being-outside-of-itself, is likewise some\u00ad\nthing simply abstract, ideal. It is that Being which, in that it is, is not, and \nwhich, in that it is not, is : it is intuited becoming. \nThis means that \nthose differences which, to be sure, are simply momentary, transmuting \nthemselves immediately, are defined as external, yet as external to them-\n43 1 \nselves.'xxiv For this interpretation, time reveals itself as 'intuited becom\u00ad\ning'. According t\" Hegel this signifies a transition from Being to nothing \nor from nothing to Being.xxv Becoming is both arising and passing away. \n1 'Der Punkt \"spreizt sich auf\" gegenuber allen anderen Punkten.' The verb 'spreizen' \nmeans 'to spread apart' ; but when used reflexively, as here, it takes on the more specific \nconnotation of swaggering, giving oneself airs. \n"

Every \"now\", \nhowever, either 'now' is-no-longer, or now is-not-yet; so it can be taken also \nas not-Being.1 Time is 'intuited' becoming-that is to say, it is the transition \nwhich does not get thought but which simply tenders itself in the sequence \nof \"nows\". If the essence of time is defined as 'intuited becoming', then it \nbecomes manifest that time is primarily understood in terms of the \n\"now\", and indeed in the very manner in which one comes across such a \n\"now\" in pure intuition. \nNo detailed discussion is needed to make plain that in Hegel's Inter\u00ad\npretation of time he is moving wholly in' the direction of the way time is \nordinarily understood. When he characterizes time in terms of the \"now\", \nthis presupposes that in its full structure the \"now\" remains levelled off \nand covered up, so that it can be intuited as something present-at-hand, \nthough present-at-hand only 'ideally'. \nThat Hegel Interprets time in terms of this primary orientation by the \n\"now\" which has been levelled off, is evidenced by the following \nsentences : 'The \"now\" is monstrously privileged: it 'is' nothing but the \nindividual \"now\" ; but in giving itself airs, this thing which is so exclusive \nhas already been dissolved, diffused, and pulverized, even while I am \nexpressing it.'xxvi 'In Nature, moreover, where time is now, no \"stable\" \n[\"bestehend\"] difference between these dimensions' (past and future) \n'ever comes about' .xxvu 'Thus in a positive sense one can say of time that \nonly the Present is; the \"before\" and \"after\" are not ; but the concrete \nPresent is the result of the past and is pregnant with the future. Thus the \ntrue Present is eternity.'xxvm \nIf Hegel calls time 'intuited becoming', then neither arising nor passing \naway has any priority in time. Nevertheless, on occasion he characterizes \ntime as the 'abstraction of consuming' [\"Abstraktion des Verzehrens\"]\u00ad\nthe most radical formula for the way in which time is ordinarily experi\u00ad\nenced and interpreted.xxlx On the other hand, when Hegel really defines \n\"time\", he is consistent enough to grant no such priority to consuming \nand passing away as that which the everyday way of experiencing time \n432 \nrightly adheres to; for Hegel can no more provide dialectical grounds for \nsuch a priority than he can for the 'circumstance' (which he has intro\u00ad\nduced as self-evident) that the \"now\" turns up precisely in the way the \npoint posits itself for itself. So even when he characterizes time as \"be\u00ad\ncorning\", Hegel understands this \"becoming\" in an 'abstract' sense, \nwhich goes well beyond the representation of the 'stream' of time. Thus \n1 'Das Sein der Zeit ist dasjetzt; sofem aber jedes Jetzt \"jetzt\" auch schon nicht-mehr\u00ad\nbzw. je jetzt zuvor noch-nicht-ist, kann es auch als Nichtsein gefast werden.' \n"

Here the sequence of \"nows\" has been formalized in the \nmost extreme sense and levelled off in such a way that one can hardly go \nany farther.xx Only from the standpoint of this formal-dialectical con\u00ad\nception of time can Hegel produce any connection between time and \nspirit. \n433 \n(b) Hegel's Interpretation of the Connection between Time and Spirit \nIf Hegel can say that when spirit gets actualized, it accords with it to \nfall into time, with \"time\" defined as a negation of a negation, how has \nspirit itself been understood ? The essence of spirit is the concept. By this \nHegel understands not the universal which is intuited in a genus as the \nform of something thought, but rather the form of the very thinking which \nthinks itself: the conceiving of oneself-as the grasping of the not-I. Inasmuch \nas the grasping of the not-I presents a differentiation, there lies in the pure \nconcept, as the grasping of this differentiation, a differentiation of the \ndifference. Thus Hegel can define the essence of the spirit formally and \napophantically as the negation of a negation. This 'absolute negativity' \ngives a logically formalized Interpretation of Descartes' \"cogito me cogitare \nrem\", wherein he sees the essence of the conscientia. \nThe concept is accordingly a self-conceiving way in which the Self has \nbeen conceived ; as thus conceived, the Self is authentically as it can be\u00ad\nthat isfree.1 'The \"I\" is the pure concept itself, which as concept has come \ninto Dasein.'xxl 'The \"I\", however, is this initialf:y pure unity which relates \nitself to itself-not immediately, but in that it abstracts from all deter-\n434 \nminateness and content, and goes back to the freedom of its unrestricted \nself-equality.'xxll Thus the \"I\" is 'universaliry', but it is 'individuality' 2  \njust as immediately. \nThis negating of the negation is both that which is 'absolutely restless' \nin the spirit and also its self-manifestation, which belongs to its essence. The \n'progression' of the spirit which actualizes itself in history, carries with it \n'a principle of exclusion'.xx111 In this exclusion, however, that which is \nexcluded does not get detached from the spirit ; it gets surmounted. The kind \n1 'Der Begriff ist sonach die sich begreifende Begriffenheit des Selbst, als welche das \nSelbst eigentlich ist, wie es sein kann, das heisstfrei.' The noun 'Begriffenheit' is of course \nderived from 'begriffen', the past participle of 'begreifen' ('to conceive' or 'to grasp'). \n'Begriffen', however, may also be used when we would say that someone is 'in the process \nof' doing something. This would suggest the alternative translation : 'The concept is \naccordingly a self-conceiving activity of the Self-an activity of such a nature that when \nthe Self performs it, it is authentically as it can be--namely,free.' \n2 '  \"Einzelheit\" '. We take this reading from Lasson's edition of Hegel, which Heidegger \ncites. The older editions of Heidegger's work have 'Einzelnheit' ; the newer ones have \n'Einzenheit'. Presumably these are both misprints. \n"

But the very fact that a formal\u00ad\ndialectical 'construction' of this connection can be ventured at all, makes \nmanifest that these are primordially akin. Hegel's 'construction' was \nprompted by his arduous struggle to conceive the 'concretion' of the spirit. \nHe makes this known in the following sentence from the concluding \nchapter of his Phenomenology of the Spirit: 'Thus time appears as the very \nfate and necessity which spirit has when it is not in itself complete : the \nnecessity of its giving self-consciousness a richer share in consciousness, of \nits setting in motion the immediacy of the \"in-itself\" (the form in which \nsubstance is in consciousness) , or, conversely, of its realizing and making \nmanifest the \"in-itself\" taken as the inward (and this is what first is inward) \n-that is, of vindicating it for its certainty of itself.'xl \nOur existential analytic of Dasein, on the contrary, starts with the \n'concretion' of factically thrown existence itself in order to unveil tem-\n436 \nporality as that which primordially makes such existence possible.

(H. 47) Edmund Husserl's investigations of tlie 'personality' have not as yet ben \npublished. The basic orientation of his problematic is apparent as early as his paper \n'Philosophic als strenge Wissenschaft', Logos, vol. I, 1910, p. 3 19. His investigation was \ncarried much further in tlie second part of his Idem zu einer reinen Phinomenologie \nund phiinomenologischen Philosophie (Husserliana IV), of which tlie first part (Cf. tlis \nJahrbuch [Jahrbuch fur Philosophie und phinomenologische Forschung-Tr.] vol. I, 1913), \npresents tlie problematic of 'pure consciousness' as tlie basis for studying tlie Con\u00ad\nstitution of any Reality whatsoever. His detailed Constitutional analyses are to be \nfound in three sections of tlie second part, where he treats : 1. tlie Constitution of \nmaterial Nature; 2. tlie Constitution of animal Nature; 3\u00b7 tlie Constitution of tlie \nspiritual world (the personalistic point of view as opposed to tlie naturalistic) . Husserl \nbegins witli tlie words: 'Altliough Diltliey grasped tlie problems which point tlie way, \nand saw tlie directions which tlie work to be done would have to take, he still failed to \npenetrate to any decisive formulations of tliese problems, or to any solutions of tliem \nwhich are metliodologically correct.' Husser! has studied tliese problems still more \ndeeply since this first treatment of them ; essential portions of his work have been \ncommunicated in his Freiburg lectures. \n"

(H. 50) But to disclose the a priori is not to make an 'a-prioristic' construction. Edmund \nHusser! has not only enabled us to understand once more the meaning of any genuine \nphilosophical empiricism; he has also given us the necesary tools. 'A-priorism' is the \nmethod of every scientific philosophy which understands itself. There is nothing \nconstructivistic about it. But for this very reason a priori research requires that the \nphenomenal basis be properly prepared. The horizon which is closest to us, and which \nmust be made ready for the analytic of Dasein, lies in its average everydayness. \nxi. (H. 51) Ernst Casirer has recently made the Dasein of myth a theme for philosophical \nInterpretation. (See his Philosophie der symholischen Formen, vol. II, Das mythisclu Denken, \nIg25.) In this study, clues of far-reaching importance are made available for ethno\u00ad\nlogical research. From the standpoint of philosophical problematics it remains an open \nquestion whether the foundations of this Interpretation are sufficiently transparent\u00ad\nwhether in particular the architectonics and the general systematic content of Kant's \nCritique of Pure &ason can provide a possible design for such a task, or whether a new \nand more primordial approach may not here be needed. That Casirer hi\u0106nself sees the \npossibility of such a task is shown by his note on pp. 16 ff., where he alludes to the \nphenomenological horizons disclosed by Husser!. In a discussion between the author and \nCassirer on the occasion of a lecture before the Hamburg section of the Kantgesellschaft \nin December 1g23 on 'Tasks and Pathways of Phenomenological Research', it was \nalready apparent that we agreed in demanding an existential analytic such as was \nsketched in that lecture. \nDivision One, Chapter Two \ni.

(H. 190) It is no accident that the phenomena of anxiety and fear, which have never \nbeen distinguished in a thoroughgoing manner, have come within the purview of \nChristian theology ontically and even (though within very narrow limits) ontologically. \nThis has happened whenever the anthropological problem of man's Being towards \nGod has won priority and when questions have been formulated under the guidance \nof phenomena like faith, sin, love, and repentance. Cf. Augustine's doctrine of the timor \ncastus and servilis, which is discussed in his exegetical writings and his letters. On fear in \ngeneral cf. his De diversis quaestionibus octoginta tribus, qu. 33 (de metu) ; qu. 34 (utrum non \naliud amandum sit, quam metu carere) ; qu. 35 (quid amandum sit). (Migne, Patrologiae Latinae \ntom. VII, pp. 23 ff.) \nLuther has treated the problem of fear not only in the traditional context of an \nInterpretation of poenitentia and contritio, but also in his commentary on the Book of \nGenesis, where, though his treatment is by no means highly conceptualized, it is all the \nmo\u00d7e impressive as edification. Cf. Enarrationes in genesin, cap. g, Werke (Erlanger \nAusgabe), Exegetica opera latina, tom. I, pp. 177 ff. \nThe man who has gone farthest in analysing the phenomenon of anxiety-and again in \nthe theological context of a 'psychological' exposition of the problem of original sin-is \nSeren Kierkegaard. Cf. Der Begriff tier Angst [17le Concept of Dread], 1844, Gesammelte \nWerke (Diederichs), vol. 5\u00b7 \nv. (H. 197) The author ran across the following pre-ontological illustration of the \nexistential-ontological Interpretation of Dasein as care in K. Burdach's article. 'Faust \nund die Sorge' (Deutsche Vierteljahrschrift fiir Littraturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte, \nvol. I, 1923, pp. 1 ff.). Burdach has shown that the fable ofCura (which has come down \nto us as No. 220 of the Fables of Hyginus) was taken over from Herder by Goethe and \nworked up for the second part of his Faust. cr. especially pp. 40 ff. The text given \nabove is taken from F. Biicheler (Rheinisches Museum, vol. 41, 1886, p. 5) ; the translation \nis from Burdach, ibid., pp. 41 ff. \nvi. (H. 198) cr. Herder's poem: 'Das Kind der Sorge' (Suphan XXIX, 75). \nvi. (H. 199) Burdach, op. cit., p. 49\u00b7 Even as early as the Stoics, 1-'lP\u2022I-'va. was a firmly \nestablished term, and it recurs in the New Testament, becoming \"sollicitudo\" in the \nVulgate. The way in which 'care' is viewed in the foregoing existential analytic of \nDasein, is one which has grown upon the author in connection with his attempts to \nInterpret the Augustinian (i.e., Helleno-Christian) anthropology with regard to the \nfoundational principles reached in the ontology of Aristotle. \n"

(H. 208) Following Scheler's procedure, Nicolai Hartmann has recently based his \nontologically oriented epistemology upon the thesis that knowing is a 'relationship of \nBeing'. Cf. his Grundziige einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis, second enlarged edition, 1g25. \nBoth Scheler and Hartman, however, in spite of all the differences in the phenomeno\u00ad\nlogical bases from which they start, fail to recognize that in its traditional basic orienta\u00ad\ntion as regards Dasein, 'ontology' has been a failure, and that the very 'relationship of \nBeing' which knowing includes (see above, H. 59 ff.), compels such 'ontology' to be \nrevised in its principles, not just critically corrected. Because Hartmann underestimates \nthe unexpressed consequences of positing a relationship-of-Being without providing an \nontological clarification for it, he is forced into a 'critical realism' which is at bottom \nquite foreign to the level of the problematic he has expounded. On Hartman's way of \ntaking ontology, cf. his 'Wie ist kritische Ontologie iiberhaupt moglich ?', Festschrift \nfiir Paul Natorp, 1g24, pp. 124 ff. \nxvii.

Stoker underestimates from the outset the hermeneutical con\u00ad\nditions for a 'description' of 'conscience as something which subsists Objectively and \nactually' (p. 3).

The line taken in the essay \ngoes beyond giving a mere historiological report, and is aimed towards the 'cate\u00ad\ngorial' problem of personality. \nHeimsoeth says: 'Too little note has been taken of the intimate way in which the \ntheoretical and the practical reason are worked into one another in Kant's practice and \nplanning; too little heed has been given to the fact that even here the categories (as \nopposed to the way in which they are filled in naturalistically in the 'principles') \nexplicitly retain their validity and, under the primacy of the practical reason, are to \nfind a new application detached from naturalistic rationalism (substance, for instance, \nin the 'person' and personal immortality; causality as the 'causality of freedom' ; and \nreciprocity in the 'community of rational creatures' ; and so forth). They serve as \nintellectual fixatives for a new way of access to the unconditioned, without seeking to \ngive any ratiocinative knowledge of it as an object.' (pp. 31 f.) \nBut here the real ontological problem has been passed over. We cannot leave aside the \nquestion of whether these 'categories' can retain their primordial validity and only \nneed to be applied in another way, or whether they do not rather pervert the ontological \nproblematics of Dasein from the ground up. Even if the theoretical reason has been \nbuilt into the practical, the existential-ontological problem of the Self remains not \nmerely unsolved ; it has not even been raisld. On what ontological basis is the 'working \ninto one another' of the theoretical and the practical reason to be performed ? Is it \ntheoretical or practical behaviour that determines the kind of Being of a person, or \nneither of them-and if neither, then what is it? In spite of their fundamental signifi\u00ad\ncance, do not the paralogisms make manifest how ontologically groundless are the \nproblema tics of the Self from Descartes' ru cogitans right up to Hegel's concept of spirit? \nOne does not need to think either 'naturalistically' or 'rationalistically', and yet one \nmay be under the domination of the ontology of the 'substantial'-a domination which \nis only more baleful because it is seemingly self-evident. \nSee what is essentially a supplement to the above-mentioned essay: Heimsoeth, 'Die \nmetaphysischen Motive in der Ausbildung des Kritischen Idealismus', Kantstudien, \nXXIX, (1924), pp. 121 ff.

[The pasage from Hegel reads as follows : \n'Time is not, as it were, a receptacle in which everything has been put in a stream, and \nfrom which it gets swept away and swept under. Time is only this abstraction of such \ncor.suming.'-Tr.J \nxx. (H. 432-433) The priority which Hegel has given to the \"now\" which has been \nlevelled off, makes it plain that in defining the concept of time he is under the sway of \nthe manner in which time is ordinarily understood; and this means that he is likewise \nunder the sway of the traditional conception of it. It can even be shown that his con\u00ad\nception of time has been drawn directly from the 'physics' of Aristotle. \nIn the Jena Logic (Cf. G. Lasson's 1923 edition), which was projected at the time of \nHegel's habilitation, the analysis of time which we find in his Encyclopedia has already \nbeen developed in all its essential parts. Even the roughest examination reveals that the \nsection on time (pp. 202 ff.) is a paraphrase of Aristotle's esay on time. In the Jena LogU; \nHegel has already developed his view of time within the framework of his philosophy of \nNature (p. 186), the first part of which is entitled 'System of the Sun' (p. 195). Hegel \ndiscusses the concept of time in conjunction with defining the concepts of aether and \nmotion. Here too his analysis of space comes later. Though the dialectic already emerges, \nit does not have as yet the rigid schematic form which it will have afterward, but still \nmakes it possible to understand the phenomena in a fairly relaxed manner. On the way \nfrom Kant to Hegel's developed system, the impact of the Aristotelian ontology and \nlogic has again been decisive. The Fact of this impact has long been well known. But \nthe kind of effect it has had, the path it has taken, even its limitations, have hitherto \nbeen as obscure as the Fact itself has been familiar. A concrete philosophical Interpretation \ncomparing Hegel's Jena Logic with the 'physics' and 'metaphysics' of Aristotle will \nbring new light. For the above considerations, some rough suggestions will suffice. \nAristotle sees the essence of time in the vvv, Hegel in the \"now\". Aristotle takes the \nvvv as opos ; Hegel takes the \"now\" as a 'boundary'. Aristotle understands the viv \nas a-r\u2022'YI\"\u00d6 ; Hegel interprets the \"now\" as a point. Aristotle describes the vOv as -roll- .,, ; \nHegel calls the \"now\" the 'absolute this' Aristotle follows tradition in connecting \nxpovos with the a\u00a2>a'ipa; Hegel stresses the 'circular course' of time. To be sure, Hegel \nescapes the central tendency of the Aristotelian analysis-the tendency to expose a \nfoundational connection (dKo.\\ovll.'iv) between the vvv, the opos, the UT''l'l\"\u00d7\u2022 and the \nTOii\u20ac \"''\u00b7 \nIn its results, Bergson's view is in accord with Hegel's thesis that space 'is' time, in \nspite of the very different reasons they have given. Bergson merely says the reverse : that \ntime (temps) is space. Bergson's view of time too has obviously arisen from an Inter\u00ad\npretation of the Ari<totelian essay on time.
