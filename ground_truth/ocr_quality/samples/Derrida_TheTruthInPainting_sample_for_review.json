This position is uncomfortable because it is \nfalse: in fact the translator's attitude to the reader is profoundly \nambivalent, and this ambivalence can only be increased when \ns/he has learned from the author to be translated that the task is \nstrictly speaking an impossible one. The absolutely generous proj\u00ad\nect of giving Derrida's meaning to be read would rapidly produce \nthe absolutely ungenerous result of leaving the text in French, \nleaving ourselves a certain amount of self-congratulation on being \nable at least to begin to read it that way, and slyly affecting com\u00ad\nmiseration for those unable to do so. The classical ideal of self\u00ad\neffacing, respectful, and charitable translation is in fact the death \nof translation. \nYet Derrida's work undeniably calls for translation, but for \ntranslation as transformation: that transformation affects both \nlanguages at work-our English is transformed as is Derrida's \nFrench. As Derrida notes, however, such a transformation must \nbe regulated jthough not, we would add, by the principle of charity \nfor the reader): yet no single rule is sufficient for that regulation, \nand least of all the rule that our aim should be to reproduce in \nthe English or American reader the same \"effect\" that Derrida's \nFrench produces on the French.

Refusing any such rule implies the adoption \nof flexible strategies, including those of supplying some of the \nFrench text, adding some explanatory footnotes, sometimes being \nguided almost exclusively by the signifier, as in parts of \" +  R\" \nand in the subtitle of \"Restitutions.\" \nThe problems facing the translator are at their greatest in the \ncase of idiom (The Truth in Painting is also \"about\" the idiom \n[in painting]): pure idiom is the untranslatable itself. Here the \nbest we can hope is that the reader might learn some French-it \nwas a guiding fantasy of our work (a fantasy which remained just \nthat) that by the end of the book the reader would have learned \nFrench and that our translation would thus have made itself un\u00ad\nnecessary, although not self-effacing. No translation could be self\u00ad\neffacing before the mise en boite of \"Cartouches\" or the revenir \nand rendre of \"Restitutions.\" Not that these are pure idioms: but \nin Derrida's work of reliteralization and etymologization of such \nexamples, the idiom becomes disseminated throughout the whole \nof French (and therefore several other languages too). This type \nof strategy completes the translators' discomfiture, in that it dis\u00ad\npossesses of mastery even the claim to have read La Verite en \npeinture. \nIt may seem paradoxical that in this situation we should claim \nthe need for accuracy and rigor: but rigor here needs to be re\u00ad\nthought in terms of flexibility and compromise, just as, in \"Res\u00ad\ntitutions,\" stricture has also to be thought in terms of destric\u00ad\nturation. The \"compromise English\" in which this translation is \nwritten is inevitable and should stand in no need of excuse, if \nonly because the supplement is never simply a substitute. \"Com\u00ad\npromise English\" also recognizes that the supplement is never \nfinal or definitive: this version is therefore also a call for retransla\u00ad\ntion and modification. \nGeoff Bennington \nIan McLeod \n"

If we are to understand \nCezanne's sentence, the truth (presentation or representation, un\u00ad\nveiling or adequation) must be rendered \"in painting\" either by \npresentation or by representation, according to the two models \nof truth. Truth, the painter's model, must be rendered in painting \naccording to the two models of truth. Henceforth, the abyssal \nexpression \"truth of the truth,\" which will have made it be said \nthat the truth is the nontruth, can be crossed with itself according \nto all sort of chiasmi, according as one determines the model as \npresentation or as representation. Presentation of the represen\u00ad\ntation, presentation of the presentation, representation of the rep\u00ad\nresentation, representation of the presentation. Have I counted \nthem correctly? That makes at least fc'lI possibilities. \n3 .  That which pertains to the picturality, in the \"proper\" \nsense, of the presentation or of the representation. Truth could \nbe presented or represented quite otherwise, according to other \nmodes. Here it is done in painting: and not in discourse (as is \ncommonly the case), in literature, poetry, theater; nor is it done \nin the time of music or in other spaces (architecture or sculpture). \nThus we retain here that which is proper to an art, the art of the \nsignatory, of Cezanne the painter. That which is proper to an art \nand an art understood in the proper sense this time, in the expres\u00ad\nsion \"in painting.\" We did not do this in the two previous cases: \n\"painting\" was there to figure the presentation or representation \nof a model, which happened to be the truth. But this troping \nfiguration was valid for the logic of any other art of presentation \nor representation. In the French language, if there is one that is \none and if it is not a painting, \"the truth in painting\" could mean \nand be understood as: the truth, as shown, presented or repre\u00ad\nsented in the field of the pictural properly speaking, in the pic\u00ad\ntural, properly pictural mode, even if this mode is tropological \nwith respect to truth itself. To understand the expression \"truth \nin painting\" in this way, no doubt one has to move away a little \nfrom the greater force of usage (assuming that there are any rig\u00ad\norous criteria for evaluating it), while nevertheless maintaining \ngrammatical and syntactical and even semantic normality. But \nthat's what an idiom is, if there is any such thing. It does not \nmerely fix the economic propriety of a \"focus,\" but regulates the \npossibility of play, of divergences, of the equivocal-a whole econ\u00ad\nomy, precisely, of the trait. This economy parasitizes itself. \n"

That which pertains to truth in the order of painting, then, \nand on the subject of painting, not only as regards the pictorial \npresentation or representation of truth. The parasitizing of the \nexpression \"in painting\" by itself allows it to harbor a new sense: \nthe truth as regards painting, that which is true on that art which \nis called pictural. If one now defines that art by its truth-value, \nin one sense or the other, one will understand here the true on \nthe true. In the French language, if there is one that is one and \nwhich is not painting, and if nonetheless it can open its system \nup to its own parasitism, \"the truth in painting\" can mean and \nbe understood as: truth in the domain of painting and on the \nsubject of it, in painting, as in the saying \"to be knowledgeable \nin painting.\" l owe you the truth on painting and I will tell it to \nyou, and as painting ought to be the truth, l owe you the truth \nabout the truth and I will tell it to you. In letting itself be par\u00ad\nasitized, the system of language as a system of the idiom has \nperhaps parasitized the system of painting; more precisely, it will \nhave shown up, by analogy, the essential parasitizing which opens \nevery system to its outside and divides the unity of the line [trait] \nwhich purports to mark its edges. This partition of the edge is \nperhaps what is inscribed and occurs everywhere [se passe partout] \nin this book; and the protocol-frame is endlessly multiplied in it, \nfrom lemmata to parerga, from exergues to cartouches. Starting \nwith the idiom of the passe-partout. One is always tempted by \nthis faith in the idiom: it supposedly says only one thing, properly \nspeaking, and says it only in linking form and meaning too strictly \nto lend itself to translation. But if the idiom were this, were it \nwhat it is thought it must be, it would not be that, but it would \nlose all strength and would not make a language. It would be \ndeprived of that which in it plays with truth-effects. If the phrase \n\"the truth in painting\" has the force of \"truth\" and in its play \nopens onto the abyss, then perhaps what is at stake in painting \nis truth, and in truth what is at stake (that idiom) is the abyss. \nCezanne's trait is easily freed from an immediate context. Is \nit even necessary to know that it was signed by a painter? Its \nforce even depends on this capacity to play with the determina\u00ad\ntions of the context without making itself indeterminate. No \ndoubt the trait acts as a passe-partout. It circulates very quickly \namong its possibilities. With disconcerting agility it displaces its \naccents or its hidden punctuation, it potentializes and formalizes \nand economizes on enormous discourses, it multiplies the deal-\n"

Traditionally, a course begins by the semantic anal\u00ad\nysis of its title, of the word or concept which entitles it and which \ncan legitimate its discourse only by receiving its own legitimation \nfrom that discourse. Thus one would begin by asking oneself: \nWhat is art? Then: Where does it come from? What is the origin \nof art? This assumes that we reach agreement about what we \nunderstand by the word art. Hence: What is the origin of the \nmeaning of \"art\"? For these questions, the guiding thread (but it \nis precisely toward the notion of the thread and the interlacing \nthat I should like to lead you, from afar) will always have been \nthe existence of \"works,\" of \"works of art.\" Hegel says so at the \nbeginning of the Lectures on Aesthetics: we have before us but a \nsingle representation, namely, that there are works of art. This \nrepresentation can furnish us with an appropriate point of depar\u00ad\nture. So the question then becomes: What is \"the origin of the \nwork of art\"? And it is not without significance that this question \ngives its title to one of the last great discourses on art, that of \nHeidegger. \nThis protocol of the question installs us in a fundamental \npresupposition, and massively predetermines the system and \ncombinatory possibilities of answers. What it begins by implying \nis that art-the word, the concept, the thing-has a unity and, \nwhat is more, an originary meaning, an etymon, a truth that is \none and naked rune verite une et nue], and that it would be \nsufficient to unveil it through history. It implies first of all that \n\"art\" can be reached following the three ways of word, concept, \nand thing, or again of signifier, signified, and referent, or even by \nsome opposition between presence and representation. \nThrough history: the crossing can in this case just as well \ndenote historicism, the determining character of the historicity \nof meaning, as it can denote ahistoricity, history crossed, trans\u00ad\nfixed in the direction of meaning, in the sense of a meaning [le \nsens d'un sens] in itself ahistorical.

Better, that its \nhistory is not a history or that it is one history only in that it is \ngoverned by this one and naked meaning, under the regime of its \ninternal meaning, as history of the meaning of art. If one were to \nconsider the physis/tekhne opposition to be irreducible, if one \nwere to accredit so hastily its translation as nature/art or nature/ \ntechnique, one would easily commit oneself to thinking that art, \nbeing no longer nature, is history.

A con\u00ad\nceptual opposition which has traditionally served to comprehend \nart would already, always, be at work there: for example the op\u00ad\nposition between meaning, as inner content, and form. Under the \napparent diversity of the historical forms of art, the concepts of \nart or the words which seem to translate \"art\" in Greek, Latin, \nthe Germanic languages, etc. (but the closure of this list is already \nproblematic), one would be seeking a one-and-naked meaning [un \n"

What is called [s'appelle: lit. \"calls itself\"] mind \nis that which says to itself \"come\" only to hear itself already \nsaying \"come back.\" The mind is what it is, says what it means, \nonly by returning.

The fact remains that here art is studied from the \npoint of view of its end. Its pastness is its truth. The philosophy \nof art is thus a circle in a circle of circles: a \"ring\" says Hegel, \nin the totality of philosophy. It turns upon itself and in annulling \nitself it links onto other rings. This annular concatenation forms \nthe circle of circles of the philosophical encyclopedia. Art cuts \nout a circumscription or takes away a circumvolution from it. \nIt encircles itself \n"

In the \"circlet\" of this scientific necessity, each part rep\u00ad\nresents a \"circle returning into itself\" and keeping a tie of soli\u00ad\ndarity with the others, a necessary and simultaneous interlacing. \nIt is animated by a \"backward movement\" (ein Riickwiirts) and \nby a \"forward movement\" ( Vorwiirts) by which it develops and \nreproduces itself in another in a fecund way (fruchtbar). Thus it \nis that, for us, the concept of the beautiful and of art is \"a pre\u00ad\nsupposition given by the system of philosophy./I Philosophy alone \ncan pose the question \"What is the beautiful?\" and answer it: the \nbeautiful is a production of art, i.e., of the mind.

What holds of speculative dialectic in general is made \nrigorously clear in the Lectures: an essential affinity with the \nCritique, the only book-third book-which it can reflect and \nreappropriate almost at once. The first two critiques of pure (spec\u00ad\nulative and practical) reason had opened an apparently infinite \ngulf. The third could, should, should have, could have thought it: \nthat is, filled it, fulfilled it in infinite reconciliation. \"Already the \nKantian philosophy not only felt the need for this junction-point \n( Vereinigungspunkt) but recognized it with precision and fur\u00ad\nnished a representation of it.\" The third Critique had the merit \nof identifying in art (in general) one of the middle terms (Mitten) \nfor resolving (auflosen) the \"opposition\" between mind and na\u00ad\nture, internal and external phenomena, the inside and the outside, \netc. But it still suffered, according to Hegel, from a lacuna, a \"lack\" \n(Mangel), it remained a theory of subjectivity and of judgment (an \nanalogous reservation of principle is expressed in The Origin). \nConfined, unilateral, the reconciliation is not yet effective. The \nLectures must supplement this lack, the structure of which has, \nas always, the form of a representative anticipation. The recon\u00ad\nciliation is only announced, represented in the third Critique in \nthe form of a duty, a Sollen projected to infinity. \nAnd so it indeed appears. \nOn the one hand, Kant declares that he \"neither wants nor \nis able\" (\u00a7 22) to examine whether \"common sense\" (here rein\u00ad\nterpreted as a nondetermined, nonconceptual, and nonintellectual \nnorm) exists as a constitutive principle of the possibility of aes\u00ad\nthetic experience or else whether, in a regulative capacity, reason \ncommands us to produce it (hervorbringen) for more elevated \npurposes. This common sense is constantly presupposed by the \nCritique, which nevertheless holds back the analysis of it. It could \nbe shown that this suspension ensures the complicity of a moral \ndiscourse and an empirical culturalism. This is a permanent \nnecessity. \nOn the other hand, recalling the division of philosophy and \nall the irreducible oppositions which the first two Critiques had \ndetermined, Kant does indeed project the plan of a work which \ncould reduce the \"enigma\" of aesthetic judgment and fill a crack, \na cleavage, an abyss (Kluft): \"If thus an abyss stretching out of \n"

But what will be the nature of the a priori principles of the \nmiddle articulation? Will they be constitutive or regulative? Do \nthey give a priori rules to pleasure and unpleasure? What is at \nstake in this question can be measured by the fact that regulative \nprinciples would not allow the demarcation of a proper domain \n(eigenes Gebiet). \nSince the Mittelglied also forms the articulation of the the\u00ad\noretical and the practical (in the Kantian sense), we are plunging \ninto a place that is neither theoretical nor practical or else both \ntheoretical and practical. Art (in general), or rather the beautiful, \nif it takes place, is inscribed here. But this here, this place is \nannounced as a place deprived of place. It runs the risk, in taking \nplace, of not having its own proper domain. But this does not \ndeprive it, for all that, of jurisdiction and foundation: what has \nno domain (Gebiet) or field (Feld) of its own, no \"field of objects\" \ndefining its \"domain,\" can have a \"territory\" and a \"ground\" \n(Boden) possessing a \"proper legality\" (Introduction, III). \nThe Mittelglied, intermediary member, must in effect be \ntreated as a separable part, a particular part (als ein besonderer \nTheil). But also as a nonparticular, nondetachable part, since it \nforms the articulation between two others; one can even say, \nanticipating Hegel, an originary part ( Ur-teil). It is indeed a ques\u00ad\ntion of judgment. The same paragraph recalls that a critique of \npure reason, i.e., of our faculty of judging according to a priori \nprinciples, would be \"incomplete\" (unvollstandig) if a theory of \njudgment, of the Mittelglied, did not form a \"particular part\" of \nit.

It does not involve any contradiction. The \nseparation of the part is not prescribed and forbidden from the \nsame point of view.

But the system of pure philosophy will have \nhad to include the critical within itself, and construct a general \ndiscourse which will get the better of the detachable and account \nfor it.

Only the critique can have a program \nthat is currently possible. \nThe question of desire, of pleasure and of unpleasure is thus \nalso the question of a detachment (neither the word nor the con\u00ad\ncept appears as such in the Critique) which will itself be specified, \ndismembered or re-membered: detachment-separation of a \nmember-, detachment-delegation of a representative, sign or \nsymbol on assignment (the beautiful as symbol of morality, prob\u00ad\nlems of the hypotyposis, of the trace (Spur), of \"cipher-script\" \n(Chiffreschrift), of the intermittent sign (Wink); see for example \nparagraphs 42 and 59), detachment-disinterested attitude as es\u00ad\nsence of aesthetic experience. \nIn order to express the relationship between the two possibles \n(the now-possible of the critique and the future-possible of meta\u00ad\nphysics), Kant proposes another metaphor.

It is not because they are detached \nbut on the contrary because they are more difficult to detach and \nabove all because without them, without their quasi-detachment, \nthe lack on the inside of the work would appear; or (which amounts \nto the same thing for a lack) would not appear. What constitutes \nthem as parerga is not simply their exteriority as a surplus, it is \nthe internal structural link which rivets them to the lack in the \ninterior of the ergon.

At the limit between work and \nabsence of work, it divides in two. And this division gives rise to \na sort of pathology of the parergon, the forms of which must be \nnamed and classified, just as Religion recognized four types of \nparergonal misdeeds or detriments. Kant is in the process of de\u00ad\ntermining lithe proper object of the pure judgment of taste.\" But \nhe does not simply exclude from it the parergon as such and in \ngeneral. Only in certain conditions. The criterion of exclusion is \nhere a formality. \nWhat must we understand by formality? \nThe parergon ( frame, garment, column) can augment the plea\u00ad\nsure of taste ( Wohlgefallen des Geschmacks), contribute to the \nproper and intrinsically aesthetic representation if it intervenes \nby its form (durch seine Form) and only by its form. If it has a \n\"beautiful form,\" it forms part of the judgment of taste properly \nspeaking or in any case intervenes directly in it. This is, if you \nlike, the normal parergon. But if on the other hand it is not beau\u00ad\ntiful, purely beautiful, i.e., of a formal beauty, it lapses into adorn\u00ad\nment (Schmuck) and harms the beauty of the work, it does it \nwrong and causes it detriment (Abbruch). This is analogous to \nthe detriment or damage (Nachteil) of Religion. \nN ow the example of this degradation of the simple parergon \ninto a seductive adornment is again a frame, this time the gilded \nframe (goldene Rahmen), the gilding of the frame done in order \nto recommend the painting to our attention by its attraction (Reiz). \nWhat is bad, external to the pure object of taste, is thus what \nseduces by an attraction; and the example of what leads astray \nby its force of attraction is a color, the gilding, in as much as it \nis nonform, content, or sensory matter. The deterioration of the \nparergon, the perversion, the adornment, is the attraction of sen\u00ad\nsory matter. As design, organization of lines, forming of angles, \nthe frame is not at all an adornment and one cannot do without \nit.

Who supplies it? Who \nconstructs it? Where is it imported from? \nFrom the analytic of concepts in the Critique of Pure [spec\u00ad\nulative] Reason. A brief reminder: this analytic of concepts is one \nof the two parts of the transcendental analytic (transcendental \nanalytic and dialectic, a division reproduced in the third Critique: \nanalytic and dialectic of aesthetic judgment). The transcendental \nanalytic comprises an analytic of concepts and an analytic of \nprinciples. The former breaks down the power of understanding \nin order to recognize in it the possibility of a priori concepts in \ntheir \"country of birth,\" namely the understanding, where they \nlie dormant and in reserve. Since (receptive) intuition alone relates \nimmediately to the object, the understanding does so by the in\u00ad\ntermediary, precisely, of judgments. Judgment is the mediate \nknowledge of an object. And we can \"refer all the acts of the \nunderstanding back to judgments, in such a way that the under\u00ad\nstanding in general can be represented as a power to judge ( Ur\u00ad\nteilskraft).\" The power to think as power to judge. One will thus \nfind the functions of the understanding by determining the func\u00ad\ntions of unity in judgment. Concepts relate, as predicates of pos\u00ad\nsible judgments, to the representation of an object. Consequently, \nby considering the simple form of the understanding, by abstract\u00ad\ning the content of judgments, one can establish the list of the \nforms of judgment under four headings and twelve moments ( four \ntimes three: the four-times-three also constructs the table (Tafel) \nI I. We have preferred to translate Derrida's \"finalite sans fin\" lit\u00ad\nerally as \"finality without end,\" rather than revert to the standard \"pur\u00ad\nposiveness without purpose\": this allows us to preserve a certain sense \nof Derrida's exploitation of different senses of the word fin (\"end\"), and \nto avoid certain traditional assumptions about Kant which Derrida's es\u00ad\nsay suspends at the very least. \"Purpose\" would be more suitable for but, \nbut we have tended to translate this as \"goal\" to avoid confusion. \n"

The difficulty can be felt from the first \nparagraph of the book, from the \"first moment of the judgment \nof taste considered from the point of view of quality.\" \"The judg\u00ad\nment of taste is aesthetic\": in this single case, not foreseen by \nthe analytic of concepts and judgments in the other Critique, the \njudgment is not a \"knowledge-judgment.\" Hence it does not come \nunder the transcendental logic whose board has been brought in. \nThe violence of the framing multiplies. It begins by enclosing \nthe theory of the aesthetic in a theory of the beautiful, the latter \nin a theory of taste and the theory of taste in a theory of judgment. \nThese are decisions which could be called external: the delimi\u00ad\ntation has enormous consequences, but a certain internal coher\u00ad\nence can be saved at this cost. The same does not apply for another \ngesture of framing which, by introducing the bord, does violence \nto the inside of the system and twists its proper articulations out \nof shape.

This point of view puts us in view of the fact \nthat an end is in view, that there is the form of finality, but we \ndo not see with a view to what the whole, the organized totality, \nis in view. We do not see its end. Such a point of view, suddenly \n[de but en blanc], bends the totality to be lacking to itself. But \nthis lack does not deprive it of a part of itself. This lack does not \ndeprive it of anything. It is not a lack. The beautiful object, the \ntulip, is a whole, and it is the feeling of its harmonious com\u00ad\npleteness which delivers up its beauty to us. The without of the \npure cut is without lack, without lack of anything. And yet in \nmy experience of the accomplished tulip, of the plenitude of its \nsystem, my knowledge is lacking in something and this is nec\u00ad\nessary for me to find this totality beautiful. This something is \nnot some thing, it is not a thing, still less part of the thing, a \nfragment of the tulip, a bit [bout] of the system. And yet it is the \nend of the system. The system is entire and yet it is visibly lacking \nits end [bout], a bit [bout] which is not a piece like any other, a \nbit which cannot be totalized along with the others, which does \nnot escape from the system any more than it adds itself on to it, \nand which alone can in any case, by its mere absence or rather \nby the trace of its absence (the trace-itself outside the thing and \nabsent-of the absence of nothing), give me what one should \nhesitate to go on calling the experience of the beautiful. The mere \nabsence of the goal would not give it to me, nor would its presence. \nBut the trace of its absence (of nothing), inasmuch as it forms its \ntrait in the totality in the guise of the sans, of the without-end, \nthe trace of the sans which does not give itself to any perception \nand yet whose invisibility marks a full totality to which it does \nnot belong and which has nothing to do with it as totality, the \ntrace of the sans is the origin of beauty. It alone can be said to be \nbeautiful on the basis of this trait. From this point of view beauty \nis never seen, neither in the totality nor outside it: the sans is \nnot visible, sensible, perceptible, it does not exist. And yet there \nis some of it and it is beautiful. It gives [\u0104a donne] the beautiful. \nIs this sans translatable?

The necessity \"thought\" in an aesthetic \njudgment can only be called \"exemplary\" (exemplarisch). It is the \nnecessity of the adhesion of all to a judgment as example (Beispiel) \nof a universal rule that one cannot enunciate (angeben) (\u00a7\u00a7 3 7  \nand 3 8, in the course of passing from the third to the fourth \ncategory, from the moment of relation to that of modality). Such \nwould be the effect of openmouthedness provoked by a unique \nexemplar whose beauty must be recognized in a judgment (mouth \nopen), without conceptual discourse, without enunciation of rules \n(mouth mute, breath cut, parole souffl.ee).27 \nTwo orders of examples: natural free beauties, analogous to \nthat of the flower (wild animals, birds, the parrot, the humming\u00ad\nbird, the bird of paradise), but also artificial free beauties, alien \nto nature. Great difficulties are foreseen. How could productions \nof art appear to us as finalities without end? As nonsignifying? \nCut from their goal? \nAnd yet it must be that there are such things if free, vague, \nwandering, pure beauty touches us in art also. But what are these \nexamples? What are the examples of productions of art which are \nbeautiful without signifying anything by and for themselves (be\u00ad\ndeuten [ . . .  ] fur sich nichts) and without representing anything? \nWithout theme and even without text, if text retains its old mean\u00ad\ning of \"signifying organization, organization of signification\"? \nShould we be surprised to encounter among them the frame or \nat least certain framing inscriptions? \n\"Plowers are free beauties of nature.

In the rhetoric of the paragraph, this sec\u00ad\nond type of example seems also to function as the insistent \nand metaphorical illustration of the first. The recourse to the \nexample of art is made in order to make us better understand \nthat of nature on a ground of analogy: \"So designs a la grecque \n[straight-line designs in labyrinth form], foliage for framework \n(Laubwerk zu Einfassungen) or on wall-papers, &c., have no \nintrinsic meaning; they represent nothing (sie stellen nichts \nvorl-no Object under a definite concept-and are free beauties. \nWe may also rank in the same class what in music are called \nfantasias [improvisation, free variation] (without a theme) (ohne \nThema), and, indeed, all music that is not set to words (die \nganze Musik ohne Text)\" (Meredith, 72). \nHence, what is beautiful according to art and with a free \nor wandering beauty, thus giving rise to a judgment of pure \ntaste, according to Kant, would be any finalized organization \nnot signifying anything, not representing anything, deprived of \ntheme and text (in the classical sense). These structures can \nalso represent, show, signify, certainly, but they are freely wan\u00ad\ndering beauties only by not doing so: insofar as somewhere \nthey apply themselves or bend themselves to not doing so.

So it would be \ndifficult, if not impossible, to reconcile what Kant said about \nthe parergon two pages earlier and what he says here of the \nframing-foliation or the series of productions without theme \nand without text which are analogous to it. The difficulty al\u00ad\nlows us to sharpen up a cutting edge. \nLike the framing-foliation, the framing parergon is a-signi\u00ad\nfying and a-representative. Another common trait is that the \nframing can also, as parergon (an addition external to the rep\u00ad\nresentation), participate in and add to the satisfaction of pure \ntaste, provided that it does so by its form and not by sensory \nattraction (color) which would transform it into finery. So there \ncan be a certain beauty of the parergon, even if it is, precisely, \nsupplementary beauty. Now what separates the parergon from \nthe framing-foliation and from other products of the same type? \nThe foliation is here considered in itself, as object and not as \naccessory. If it does without signification and representation, \nthis is no longer at all like the frame. The frame does not \nsignify anything, and that's that, Kant seems to think. One sees \nin it no presentiment of any signification, nothing in it is fin\u00ad\nalized or finalizable.

But this tension, this vection, this rection is \nabsolutely interrupted, with a clean blow. It has to be thus \ninterrupted: by having to be, purely, absolutely, removing all \nadherence to what it cuts itself off from, it liberates beauty \n( free, wandering, and vague). By having to be interrupted, the \nsans-text and the sans-theme relate to the end in the mode of \nnonrelation. Absolute nonrelation. And by having to be so, this \nabsolute nonrelation must also, if possible, be inscribed in the \nstructure of the artifact. The sans of the sans-theme and the \nsans-text must be marked, without being either present or ab\u00ad\nsent, in the thing to which it does not belong and which is no \nlonger quite a thing, which one can no longer name, which is \nnot, once charged with the mark, a material support or a form \nof what is to be found neither here nor there, and which one \n"

On the one hand this is the first time signs are mentioned: \nyet a whole semiotics supports the third Critique. On the other \nhand the reference to something \"very ancient\" that is accessible \nonly via signs communicates with a certain elliptical remark, \nhasarded as if in passing, in the introduction (VI): the pleasure \n(Lust) of knowing, which is no longer noticed now, \"surely existed \nin its day.\" \nAnd this pleasure is a pleasure of the same: it always stems \nfrom the mastery of the dissimilar, from the reduction of the \nheterogeneous. The agreement, conformity, coming together (Zu\u00ad\nsammentreffen) of perceptions and categories (general concepts \nof nature to which laws conform) apparently procure no pleasure. \nBut the reduction of several \"heterogeneous\" empirical laws to \none principle \"causes a very remarkable pleasure.\" And although \nthe intelligence of nature in its unity no longer necessarily pro\u00ad\ncures for us such a pleasure, this pleasure \"certainly existed in \nits day\" (aber sie ist gewiss zu ihrer Zeit gewesen), otherwise \"the \ncommonest experience would not be possible.\" It's just that this \npleasure gradually became confused with experience and was no \nlonger noticed. \nThus, although the third Critique (the place of aesthetics) \ndissociates pleasure and knowledge, although it makes of this \ndissociation a rigorous juridical frontier between taste and knowl\u00ad\nedge, the aesthetic and the logical, it must be that the pleasure \nprinciple somewhere, in a time immemorial (a concept whose \nstatus remains highly uncertain in a Critique), governed knowl\u00ad\nedge, conditioned it and accompanied it everywhere that knowl\u00ad\nedge was possible, determined it as experience (in the Kantian \nsense), thus preceding the divergence between enjoying and know\u00ad\ning.

For example, if caricature cor\u00ad\nresponds to an exaggeration of the norm-idea, an extreme within \nthe type, the genius, marks, for his part, in the face itself and in \nits expression, a divergence which deports the type. \nThe ideal of beauty-this is the other piece-is distinguished \nfrom this norm-idea.

As always, so long \nas such an idea remains on the horizon, moral law allies itself \nwith empirical culturalism to dominate the field. \n2. The other significant indecision as to the principle concerns \nthe division of the fine arts. This division comprises, as always, \na hierarchy, going far into detail and also resting on an analogy: \nbetween art and human language. The three kinds of fine arts \n(talking art, figurative (bildende) art, the art of the play of sen\u00ad\nsations (Spiel der EmpfindungenJJ correspond to the forms of hu\u00ad\nman expression referred to the body's means of expression (artic\u00ad\nulation, gesticulation, modulation: words, gestures, tones). This \ncorrespondence is analogical. But on two occasions, in footnotes, \nKant shows that he does not absolutely hold to this principle of \nhierarchical classification and that he does not consider it to have \nan absolutely reliable theoretical value: \"If then we wish to divide \nup the Fine Arts, we cannot, at least on a trial basis (wenigstens \nzum Versuche), choose a more convenient principle (bequemeres \nPrincip) that the analogy of art with the kind of expression which \nmen use in their language (Sprechen) in order to communicate to \none another, as perfectly as possible, not only their concepts but \nalso their sensations. * \n\"*The reader should not judge this sketch of a possible di\u00ad\nvision of the fine arts as a theoretical project. It is but one of the \nmany attempts than can and must still be tried\" [Kant's footnote] \n(\u00a7 5 I ). \nThe redundancy of a second note, in the same paragraph, \nunderlines the embarrassment: \"The reader must in general con\u00ad\nsider this only as an attempt to tie together the fine arts under \none principle, which this time must be that of the expression of \naesthetic ideas (according to the analogy of a language (nach der \nAnalogie einer Sprache)), and not a derivation held to be decisive.\" \nKant's scruple would only be the index of a critical vigilance \nif it bore upon a localizable, revisable, or detachable point of the \nsystem. But it is not clear how he would have been able to avoid, \n"

The trait of this double attraction \nis all the more interesting because it has to do with, precisely, \nthe double, and the one, the colossus, as double. \nSpeaking only of the kolossos, Vemant declares: \"Originally, \nthe word has no implication of size [taille].\"31 \"Has no implication \nof size\": this apparently, visibly, means that a kolossos is not \nnecessarily big, gigantic, out of proportion. Although the context, \nand consequently Vernant's manifest intention, does not invite \nthis in the least, the \"implication of size\" carries us somewhere \nelse. Before referring to size, and above all that of the human body, \nfor example foot size, which is also called pointure in French, \ntaille marked the line of a cut, the cutting edge of a sword, all \nthe incisions which come to broach a surface or a thickness and \nopen up a track, delimit a contour, a form or a quantity /a cut/ting) \nof wood or cloth).32 \nIf, \"originally, the word [kolossos] has no implication of size,\" \nit will come to have this implication later, adds Vemant, only by \naccident. What about the accident, this one in particular, which \nbrings cise to the colossus, not the incisive cise which gives mea\u00ad\nsure, not the moderating [m odera trice] cise but the dispropor\u00ad\ntionate [demesurante] cise? This accident is not, apparently, part \nof the program of Vemant's rich study; he is content to brush the \nquestion aside in his first few lines: \"Originally the word has no \nimplication of size. It does not designate, as it will later for ac\u00ad\ncidental reasons, effigies of gigantic, 'colossal' dimensions. In Greek \nstatue-vocabulary, which as Monsieur E. Benveniste has shown \nis very diverse and fairly fluctuating, the term kolossos, of the \n3 I .  \"Figuration de l'invisible et categorie psychologique du double: \nIe colossos,\" in My the et pensee chez les Crees [(Paris: Maspero, I965; \nreprint in 2 vols., I982), 2:65 -78; English translation (London: Routledge \nand Kegan Paul, I983), 305 -20j.-J.D. \n32. To render this second sense of the French taille, and to preserve \nthe uncertainty between the two senses which is vital in some of what \nfollows, we shall use the word \"eise,\" an obsolete spelling of \"size\" (see \nOED) and suggestive of cutting (d. incision). \n"

The dimension of \nthe effigy, the effigy itself would have the fictional effect of de\u00ad\nmeasuring.

First of all because it is \nnot a work, an ergon, and then because the infinite is presented \nin it and the infinite cannot be bordered. The beautiful, on the \ncontrary, in the finitude of its formal contours, requires the par\u00ad\nergonal edging all the more because its limitation is not only \nexternal: the parergon, you will remember, is called in by the \nhollowing of a certain lacunary quality within the work. \nIn presenting an indeterminate concept, in one case of the \nunderstanding, in the other of reason, the beautiful and the sub\u00ad\nlime produce a \"Wohlgefallen\" which is often translated by \"sat\u00ad\nisfaction,\" and which I have suggested transposing into \"pleasing\u00ad\noneself-in\" for reasons already given and also to avoid the saturation \nof the \"enough\" which does not fit. In the case of the beautiful, \nthe \"pleasing-ones elf-in\" is \"linked\" to quality, in the case of the \nsublime, to quantity. Wherein one can already anticipate the ques\u00ad\ntion of the cise and the difference between the colossus and the \ncolumn. \nWe had already recognized the other difference in another \ncontext: the pleasure (Lust) provoked by the sublime is negative. \nIf we reread this sequence with a view to the kolossos, the logic \nof the cise, of the pure cut, of the without-cise, of the excess or \nof the almost-too-much-cise, imposes once more its necessity. In \nthe experience of the beautiful, there is intensification and ac\u00ad\nceleration of life, feeling is easily united to the ludic force of the \nimagination and to its attractions (Reizen). In the feeling of the \nsublime, pleasure only \"gushes indirectly.\" It comes after inhi\u00ad\nbition, arrest, suspension (Hemmung) which keep back the vital \nforces. This retention is followed by a brusque outpouring, an \neffusion (Ergiessung) that is all the more potent. The schema here \nis that of a dam. The sluice gate or floodgate interrupts a flow, \nthe inhibition makes the waters swell, the accumulation presses \non the limit. The maximum pressure lasts only an instant (au\u00ad\ngenblicklich), the time it takes to blink an eye, during which the \npassage is strictly closed and the stricture absolute. Then the dam \nbursts and there's a flood. A violent experience in which it is no \nlonger a question of joking, of playing, of taking (positive) plea\u00ad\nsure, nor of stopping at the \"attractions\" of seduction. No more \nplay (Spiel) but seriousness (Ernst) in the occupation of the imag\u00ad\nination. Pleasure is joined with attraction (Reiz), because the mind \nis not merely attracted (angezogen) but, conversely, always also \nrepulsed (abgestossen).

The \"which\" of the \"which is almost \ntoo large\" has as its antecedent, from one edition to another, \nthe concept or the presentation. But does this not amount to \nthe same thing? The presentation of something which is too \nlarge to be presented or the presentation, too large to be pre\u00ad\nsented, of something-that always produces an inadequation of \nthe presentation to itself. And this possible inequality of the \npresent of presentation to itself is what opens the dimension \nof the colossal, of the colossal Darstellen, of the erection there \nin front [la-devant] of the colossus which cises itself.35 It cises \nitself, rises up and rises up again in its immense cise, both \nlimited since what is presented remains too large, almost too \nlarge for it, and unlimited by the very thing it presents or which \npresents itself in it. This double trait of a cise which limits \nand unlimits at one and the same time, the divided line upon \nwhich a colossus comes to cise itself, incise itself without cise, \nis the sublime. Kant also calls it \"subjective\": let us decipher \nin this the psychic ideality of what \"is not in nature,\" the \norigin of the psyche as kolossos, the relation to the double of \nthe ci-devant36 who comes to erect himself la-devant.

Thus, for example, as for giving name or title: \"But \ngift of nothing, of no thing, such a gift violently appropriates, \nharpoons, arraigns what it seems to engender, it penetrates and \nparalyzes at a stroke the donee thus consecrated. By being mag\u00ad\nnified, this latter becomes to some extent the object of his namer \nor nicknamer,\" or again, \"we do not comprehend here the text \nnamed as Genet's, it does not exhaust itself in the pocket I cut, \nsew, and bind. It is the text which pierces a hole in the pocket, \nharpoons it first, looks at it; but also sees it escape, carrying its \narrow toward unknown neighborhoods,\" and, as for the necessity \nto elaborate under the sheath, \"all that must stay under the sheath \n. . .  there is more iouissance . . .  in acting as if the fish remained \nentire, still alive, the more mobile, slippery, and fleeting for know\u00ad\ning itself to be threatened.\" And since there is the angle and the \nwave ronde], the indefatigable and worrying insistence of finger\u00ad\nnails [ongles] in all Adami's drawings (except, well well, in the \nthree congeneric Glas drawings; for once they are setups without \nhands, and nothing human appears in them as such: \"juridical \nexhibits\" and \"scene of a crime,\" concludes Benjamin faced with \nthe first empty streets photographed by Atget), go and read on \none double page (274) the association of fish and fingernails.

And Le Front Benjamin never closes off again, its idiom \nis caught, as a differential trait in its turn, in a journey, the di\u00ad\nagonal line of a fictive narration with which it exchanges or links \nall its fragments. \nFor example with The Surrealist Map of the World (the sur\u00ad\nrealists had erased Spain from it) and especially with Freud's Tour\u00ad\nney which dates from the same year, also operates from a pho\u00ad\ntograph, accumulates, in the border crossing, the energy of a \ntheoretico-political unfurling, the incredible epos of a Jewish hero, \n"

This time the paradigm seems to escape disaster, it does not \nfall into decomposition. No rout [debandade: with a connotation \nof detumescence]. It even holds the presumed dead man in a state \nof constant rigidity, rigor stretched by strict bonds. The stricture \nis knotted within and without, it traverses the partition like a \nlace, a series of laces pulling in all directions [dans tous les sens]. \n(In all senses [dans tous les sens], the series will come back to \ninterlacing, and already in the words series, lineage, linking [en\u00ad\nchainement] and in Greek seira, cord, chain, lasso, knotted cord.) \nBut it indeed gives the example and the place of decomposition, \nof remains and reliefs; and it does indeed seem to have the same \nrelationship with the 1 27 articles as the \"living\" banana has with \nthe fifty-nine false copies in plastic, even though these are, pre\u00ad\ncisely, in plastic, in relief, and the former drawn flat.

Marking the place of \"natural\" decomposition, sup\u00ad\nposed to give it a place in itself (remains in it), it does not de\u00ad\ncompose. All its drawn perspectivizations (partial ones, unlike \nthe bananas) do perhaps decompose it in(to) part(s), but it is made \nso as not to decompose, to exceed analysis in its prime number. \nNow here is the paradox of the paradigm: by reason of its very \nprerogative, and of that other (hi)story which refers it to the \"phan\u00ad\ntasmata,\" it is deposed from its privilege.

Hunger of the drive [pulsion].\" \nThe association coffin/matchbox appears to be quite neces\u00ad\nsary to Titus-Carmel, since in his cartouche (on \"surgery\") he \nquotes Funeral Rites in a note (\"In my pocket, the matchbox, the \nminute coffin\"). \nSuch a necessity, by him retained, obliges one to insist. \nApparently the coffin is not a matchbox, nor even a coffin \ntruly identifiable as such in the West, nor, without doubt, else\u00ad\nwhere. It does not open, except by breaking in, and contains not \na single match, not one of those little wooden bodies lying side \nby side, waiting to catch fire and flame between your fingers. And \nyet. From the moment the cartouche on \"surgery,\" on the first \npage, associates in a note-cartouche of the cartouche-the coffin \nand the matchbox, then this contiguity forms part of the serial \nwork.

A box open \non top fits into [s'emboite dans] another box, the same box, open \non two sides, at its last extremities. The hermetic closure com\u00ad\nposes the two openings, is composed by them both. The box \ndecomposes-into two independent boxes; and boxes itself in [se \nmet en boite] in this decomposition. Now sliding the coffin into \nthe catafalque involves a boxing-in of this type. This mise en \nboite of the box does indeed, in Funeral Rites, form one of the \nmany movements which induce the coup de theatre, after this \none, which prepared things from a greater distance: \n\"I wonder why Death, film stars, virtuosi abroad, queens in \nexile, banished kings, have a body, a face, hands. Fascination for \nthem comes from something other than a human charm, and \nSarah Bernhardt, without disappointing the enthusiasm of the \npeasant women who wanted to catch a glimpse of her at the door \nof her railway carriage, could have appeared in the form of a little \nbox of Swedish matches.

A demonstration to be \nfollowed up, for let us have no doubt about this, in this restitution \ntrial, it's also a question of the shoes, or even the clogs, and going \nonly a little further back for the moment, of the feet of two \nillustrious Western professors, neither more nor less. \n- It's certainly a question of feet and of many other things, \nalways supposing that feet are something, and something iden\u00ad\ntifiable with itself.

Among \nthem is the determination of the thing as underneatb (bypokei\u00ad\nmenon or bypostasis) in opposition to the symbebekota which \narise on top of it. This oppositional couple will be transformed, \nin Latin, into subjectum (substantia)/accidens. This is only one \nof the pairs of oppositions that fall upon/attack the thing. The \nother two are, according to Heidegger, that of aistbeton/noeton \n(sensible/intelligible) and that of byle/eidos-morpbe (matterlform\u00ad\nfigure). \n"

They have effects on everything \nthat follows. He simplifies matters by saying that Heidegger \ninterprets a painting to illustrate the nature of art as the un\u00ad\nveiling of truth. To prove this, one has no need to refer to what \nthe following page says, i.e., (in translation first): lithe work in \nno way served (diente gar nicht), as it may have seemed at first, \nto illustrate more clearly what a product is.\" What has here been \ntranslated as lIillustrate\" is Veranschaulichung this time, and \nnot Darstellung, which was also translated above as illustration. \nVeranschaulichung, intuitive presentation, as it were, is what \nhad to be facilitated by invoking the example of the picture. \nBut it is also what was not done, although it seemed as though \nthat's what was happening. Heidegger makes this quite clear: \nthe work did not serve us to do that, did not do us this service \nwhich, all in all, we pretended to expect from it. It did better \nthan illustrating or presenting something to sensory intuition\u00ad\nor worse, depending on the point of view- it showed, it made \nappear. Heidegger has just recalled that the work did not \"serve\" \nas Veranschaulichung or Darstellung, and he goes on to specify: \n\"Much more is it the being-product of the product which arrives, \nproperly (eigens) and only through the work, at its appearing.\" \nThis appearing of the being-product does not, according to Hei\u00ad\ndegger, take place in an elsewhere which the work of art could \nillustrate by referring to it. It takes place properly (and only) in \nthe work. In its very truth. This might seem to aggravate the \nillusion denounced by Schapiro and to place under the heading \nof presentation what was marked down only in the name of \nrepresentation, as if Heidegger thought he could see still more \ndirectly what Schapiro reproaches him for inferring too hastily. \nBut things are not yet so simple and we shall have to return to \nthis. \nFirst of all: it is not as peasant shoes, but as product (Zeug) \nor as shoes-as-product that the being-product manifested itself. \nThe manifestation is that of the being-product of the product and \nnot of this or that species of product, such as shoes. Such was the \nfunction of the Darstellung. It must be carefully demarcated in \nthis passage and its stages differentiated.

Thus the product is half a thing, because de\u00ad\ntermined by thingliness, and yet more than that; at the same time \nit is half work of art, and yet less than that \n- so a work like the shoe picture represents half of itself and \nyet less than that \n- and yet less than that, because it lacks the self-sufficiency \nof the work of art. \n- so a work like the shoe-picture exhibits what something \nlacks in order to be a work, it exhibits-in shoes-its lack of itself, \none could almost say its own lack. And that is how it's supposed \nto be self-sufficient? Accomplished? Does it complete itself then? \nUnless it overflows (itself), into inadequation, excess, the \nsupplement? \n- Heidegger continues. \"The product thus has its proper in\u00ad\ntermediate place (Zwischenstellung) between the thing and the \nwork, always supposing that it is permissible to give in to such \nan accountant-like classification.\" \nWhat, to Heidegger's own eyes, limits the legitimacy of this \narithmetical triplicity (the one by which Schapiro boldly sums \nup the whole context: \"in the course of distinguishing three modes \nof things . . .  \"), is that if thing 2 (the product) is between thing I \n"

Heidegger begins a new paragraph, as he had after \" Und \ndennoch/l, and he writes: \"But perhaps we see all this only on \nthe shoes in the picture (im Eilde, or in image),\" as a picture, as \nan image, etc. The fact that he says \"perhaps,\" that he pretends, \nat least hypothetically, to see a limit in a description constrained \nor contained by pictorial determinations, this simple fact clarifies \nthe possibility of crossing the frame in both directions.

He is now going to operate \nin several moments and according to a very strange procedure. \nFirst moment: this usefulness can only allow itself to be ap\u00ad\nprehended in use, during use, by use. So no painting is ever at all \nuseful to us for the apprehension of the usefulness of a product. \nEvocation of the peasant woman, then, outside the picture: \"The \nbeing-product of the product consists in its usefulness. But what \nabout this usefulness? Do we already seize along with it what is \nproperly product in the product (das Zeughafte des Zeuges)? In \norder to succeed in this, must we not go in search of the useful \nproduct in the course of its use (in seinem Dienste)? The peasant \nwoman in the fields wears the shoes. Only there are they what \nthey are. They are all the more authentically so (echter) the less \nthe peasant woman at work thinks about her shoes, or the less \nshe looks at them, or even the less she feels them. She stands \nand walks in them. This is how the shoes are actually of service. \nThrough the process of using the product the properly product of \nthe product must come to meet us.\" \nStill within this first phase, Heidegger pretends-it's a rhe\u00ad\ntorical procedure-to draw a consequence from what has just been \nsaid: if usefulness, the essence of the being-product, can only \nappear in the course of use, by use, if use can only, as he thinks, \nbe actual, actuality itself, then the picture is of no use for acceding \nto what serves, to the usefulness of the product. It is useless for \nthe apprehension of the useful. But why? \nApparently for a single reason. But this reason doubles up and \nthis doubling interests me. Again it is a movement of interlacing \nby the lace. Let us understand at least three things by this word: \n( I ) the interlacing of the lace with itself; (2) the fact that it is also \nincompletely laced (entre-lace, as you say entrouvert [half-open] \n"

The chain which links solid to solidarity \nand to solder is indeed that of tightening up, the one that is at \nwork here. Here is the French translation from Holzwege. On first \nreading and because of the word \"solidity,\" it runs the risk of \ndefinitively obscuring the German version. And yet: \"the latter \n[usefulness] in its turn resides in the plenitude of an essential \nbeing of the product. We call it solidity (die Verldsslichkeit).

Where do the shoes start from, to where and to whom \ndo they return, from where do they return as they get closer, etc. ? \nAnd the whole path of thought, for Heidegger, leads back, by a \ndis-tancing, to a Da (thus the Da of Sein) which is not merely \nclose, but whose proximity lets the distance of the fort play within \nit. The relation is not one of opposition; each notion offers an \neyelet to be traversed by the other, to the figure or the size [poin\u00ad\nture] of the other. Fort: Da.

It does not only consist in the large number of \npeasants and peasant women, of peasant shoes (untied or not, and \nwhether or not they are named, declared, or entitled accordingly) \nwhich Van Gogh painted, before and after 1886; in the large num\u00ad\nber of scenes and objects from peasant life which he stubbornly \nwanted to restitute in painting and in truth (\"that it should be a \ntrue painting of peasants. I know that is it. . .\n. By such paintings, \nthey learn something useful.\" From letters to his brother Theo, \n1883-8 5 ;  these letters are full of invective against the \"city \ndwellers\"). No. It consists in this: the \"ideology\" which Heidegger \nis accused of projecting, an \"ideology\" which to save time we \ncould call rural, of the soil, earthy, artisanal, this \"heavy pathos \nof the native and the countryman\"-is it so alien to Van Gogh? \nTo the Van Gogh who said, \"When I say that I am a painter of \npeasants, it is indeed truly so and you will get a better idea from \n"

What is \"my \nghost\"? What does the phrase \"the ghost of my other I\" say? My \nother I, is that myself or an other I, an other who says \"I\"? Or a \n\"myself\" which is itself only divided by the phantom of its dou\u00ad\nble? Once there is phantom or double as revenant, the logic of \nidentification-is there any need to insist on this?-is not so \neasily appeased as Schapiro seems to think.

What is then \nthe spectrum of possibilities of the possibility of specters?23 The \nshoes can be unpaired, each of them can belong to another pair \nby which they continue to let themselves be haunted. But in this \nfirst case of unmatchedness, things can still function [aller] or at \nleast walk [marcher] if the shoe size and the double orientation \n(right and left) permit. That is a first possibility, almost \"normal,\" \nalthough the unpairedness, indicated by other traits, makes limp \nor squint the disturbed experience that we have in this case. The \nsecond possibility: one single shoe. We've already spoken about \nit. Is it a pair that's had part of it amputated? Is it one shoe \namputated from the pair to which it belongs? Is it haunted by the \nother one? Triumphant and sovereign, alone at last, and capturing \nfor itself the whole of the fetishist investiture? Or the narcissistic \ninvestiture? Is it the better-collected double of the dead man or \nthe dead woman? The erection of the limp? The elimination of \nthe double? The misery or monumental sovereignty of the un\u00ad\nusable? All these investitures are possible, they remain, open to \nthe syntax of all the specters. The third possibility (I'm sure I'm \ngoing to forget some): two right shoes or two left shoes. They \ncannot be put on, or used, in principle. In any case they do not \ngo together without injuring the wearer, unless he has the feet of \na monster. But the two shoes, now detached from wearing and \nuse, reflect each other better. Each one is strangely the double of \nthe other. The accumulation of haunting here finds a supplemen\u00ad\ntary benefit, for it can combine the preceding possibilities, prop \nthem up, augment them. This third possibility divides in two: ( I )  \nthe two right shoes or two left shoes can belong to two different \npairs, and thus to an origin that continues to inhabit them even \nif they are detached from it. Each one of these pairs is separated \nfrom itself but leaves its mark on each shoe. It is recognizable, \nand this difference between the two right shoes or the two left \nshoes manages to break up, a little, their air of being superim\u00ad\nposable and therefore disturbing, limping, and suspicious; it ini\u00ad\ntiates a repairing which is very quickly inhibited. (2) The two \nright or left shoes are exactly alike, for they belong to two pairs \n(separated one from the other and from themselves) which have \nno difference between them except a numerical one. You would \nthink you were seeing double: two perfectly identical unique \n23 . Le spectre means both \"spectrum\" and \"specter.\" \n"
