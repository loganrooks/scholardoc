The \ufb01rst step of this deconstruction\nof philosophy, which attempts to locate that which is present nowhere\nin philosophy. i.e., that which philosophy must hide in order to\nremain philosophy, is precisely the examination of the notion of presence\nas undertaken by Heidegger. Heidegger, says Derrida, recognized in the\nnotion of presence the \u201cdestiny of philosophy,\u201d and the reference to\nthe Heideggerean deconstruction of presence is a constant throughout\nDerrida\u2019s works. (Indeed, the reader unfamiliar with Heidegger may\nwell be mysti\ufb01ed by Derrida\u2019s frequent references to the notion of\npresence as the central target in the deconstruction of philosophy.) The\ngrammatological (from the Greek gramma meaning letter or writing)\nopening consists in the examination of the treatment of writing by\nphilosophy, as a \u201cparticularly revelatory symptom\u201d (Positions, p. 15)\nboth of how the notion of presence functions in philosophy and of\nwhat this notion serves to repress. Derrida arrived at this position\nthrough a close scrutiny of the philosophical genealogy of linguistics,\nespecially the philosophical treatment of the sign. From Plato to\nHeidegger himself, Derrida demonstrates, there is a persistent exclu-\nsion of the notion of writing from the philosophical de\ufb01nition of the\nsign. Since this exclusion can always be shown to be made in the name\nof presence\u2014the sign allegedly being most present in spoken discourse\u2014\nDerrida uses it as a \u201csymptom\u201d which reveals the workings of the\n\u201crepressive\u201d logic of presence, which determines Western philosophy\nas such.\nDerrida\u2019s division of L\u2019\u00e9criture et la di\ufb00\u00e9rence into two parts, then, serves\nto remind the reader that between the sixth and seventh essays a \u201ctheo-\nretical matrix\u201d was elaborated whose principles are to some extent\nderived from the \ufb01rst six essays and are more systematically put to\nwork in the last \ufb01ve. However, I would like to propose another division\nof the book, a division between the \ufb01fth (\u201c\u2018Genesis and Structure\u2019 and\nPhenomenology\u201d) and sixth essays. My reason for placing the division\nat this point stems from what Derrida says about La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne,\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxi\n"

I o\ufb00er this division,\nagain, to help orient the reader who comes to Writing and Di\ufb00erence\nknowing only that Derrida is very di\ufb03cult to read. Indeed, without\nsome foreknowledge of (1) the attempt already begun by Derrida in\n1959, but not presented until approximately the middle of this vol-\nume, to expand the deconstruction of metaphysics via a reading of\nHusserl\u2019s treatment of the sign; a reading which always pushes toward\na moment of irreducible di\ufb00erence conceived not only as the danger to\nthe doctrines of truth and meaning which are governed by presence,\nbut also as an inevitable danger in the form of writing which allows\ntruth and meaning to present themselves; and (2) the constant refer-\nence to Heidegger\u2019s analyses of the notion of presence, the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve\nessays of Writing and Di\ufb00erence might be incomprehensible. This is not to\ngainsay Derrida\u2019s statement that the last \ufb01ve essays only are \u201cengaged\nin the grammatological opening.\u201d These last \ufb01ve essays do follow\nDerrida\u2019s original publication (in Critique) of a systematic theoretical\nmatrix for a deconstruction of metaphysics along the lines \ufb01rst laid out\nin the analyses of Husserl; this is why La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne comes \ufb01rst.\nTherefore, without setting aside the speci\ufb01c, individual contents of the\n\ufb01rst \ufb01ve essays, one must also be alerted to their developing systematic-\nity, a systematicity whose guiding thread is embedded in the passage\njust cited from \u201c\u2018Genesis and Structure\u2019 and Phenomenology.\u201d The\nbest way to follow this thread is to pay close attention to Derrida\u2019s\ndemonstrations\u2014less and less elliptical as one continues through Writing\nand Di\ufb00erence\u2014of how philosophically \u201ctraditional\u201d some of the most\n\u201cmodern\u201d concepts of criticism and philosophy are, for example in the\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxiii\n"

Within the limits to which it is possible,\nor at least appears possible, translation practices the di\ufb00erence between\nsigni\ufb01ed and signi\ufb01er. But if this di\ufb00erence is never pure, translation is\nno more so; and for the notion of translation we would have to substi-\ntute a notion of transformation: a regulated transformation of one lan-\nguage by another, of one text by another. We will never have, and in fact\nhave never had, any \u2018transfer\u2019 of pure signi\ufb01eds\u2014from one language\nto another, or within one language\u2014which would be left virgin and\nintact by the signifying instrument or \u2018vehicle\u2019 \u201d (Positions, p. 31).\nThe translator, then, must be sure that he has understood the syntax\nand lexicon of the original text in order to let his own language carry\nout the work of transformation. Again, this is best facilitated by obey-\ning the strictures of his language, for a precipitate bending of it into\nunaccustomed forms may be indicative more of his own miscompre-\nhension than of di\ufb03culties in the original text. In this respect, the\ntranslator\u2019s position is analogous to that of the psychoanalyst who\nattempts to translate the manifest language of dreams into a latent\nlanguage. To do so, the analyst must \ufb01rst be sure that he has understood\nthe manifest language. As Derrida says in note 3 of \u201cCogito and the\nHistory of Madness,\u201d \u201cThe latent content of a dream (and of any\nconduct or consciousness in general) communicates with the manifest\ncontent only through the unity of a language; a language which the\nanalyst, then, must speak as well as possible.\u201d The discussion of terms\no\ufb00ered below, and the translator\u2019s footnotes in the text, are an attempt\nto provide a guide to the \u201cmanifest\u201d language of Writing and Di\ufb00erence.\nLike the analyst, however, the reader must let his attention \ufb02oat, and be\nsatis\ufb01ed with a partial understanding of a given essay on any particular\nreading. As the manifest language begins to become more familiar, the\npersistence of the \u201clatent\u201d content\u2014what Derrida has called \u201cthe\nunconscious of philosophical opposition\u201d (Positions, p. 60, note 6; my\nitalics)\u2014will become a surer guide, a more salient thread in the weave\nof these texts.\nDerrida\u2019s terms. Wherever Derrida uses di\ufb00\u00e9rance as a neologism I have left\nit untranslated. Its meanings are too multiple to be explained here fully,\nbut we may note brie\ufb02y that the word combines in neither the active\nnor the passive voice the coincidence of meanings in the verb di\ufb00\u00e9rer: to\ntranslator\u2019s introduction xvii\n"

Derrida also consistently plays on the derivation of sens (mean-\ning or sense; Sinn in German) which includes both a supposedly intelli-\ngible, rational sense (a signi\ufb01ed meaning) and a vehicle dependent on\nthe senses for its expression (the signi\ufb01er). Further, in French sens also\nmeans direction; to lose meaning is to lose direction, to be lost, to feel\nthat one is in a labyrinth. I have in\ufb02ected the translation of sens to\nconform to its play of meanings wherever possible.\nHeidegger\u2019s terms. While the concept of Being belongs to the entire meta-\nphysical tradition, its translation into English has become particularly\ndi\ufb03cult since Heidegger\u2019s analyses of it. German and French share the\nadvantage that their in\ufb01nitives meaning to be (sein, \u00eatre) can also be used\nas substantives that mean Being in general. Further, in each language\nthe present participle of the in\ufb01nitive (seiend, \u00e9tant) can also be used as a\nsubstantive meaning particular beings. No such advantage exists in Eng-\nlish, and since Heidegger is always concerned with the distinction\nbetween Sein (\u00eatre, Being in general) and Seiendes (\u00e9tant, beings) the cor-\nrect translation of these substantives becomes the \ufb01rst problem for any\nconsideration of Heidegger in English. (The verb forms present no\ndi\ufb03culties: sein and \u00eatre as in\ufb01nitives become to be, and the gerunds seiend\nand \u00e9tant become being.) I have followed the practice of John Macquar-\nrie and Edward Robinson in their translation of Being and Time (New\nYork: Harper and Row, 1962) and have translated the substantive\n(derived from the in\ufb01nitive) Sein (\u00eatre) as \u201cBeing\u201d (with a capital initial)\nwherever it appears in this volume. However I have modi\ufb01ed their\ntranslation of Seiendes (\u00e9tant)\u2014the substantive from the present\nparticiple\u2014as \u201centity\u201d or \u201centities,\u201d and have translated it as \u201cbeing\u201d or\n\u201cbeings.\u201d Macquarrie and Robinson, in fact, state that \u201cthere is much\nto be said\u201d for this translation (Being and Time, p. 22, note 1). I feel that it\nis preferable to \u201centity\u201d not only because, as they state, \u201cin recent\nBritish and American philosophy the term \u2018entity\u2019 has been used more\ngenerally to apply to anything whatsoever, no matter what its onto-\nlogical status\u201d (ibid.), but also because \u201centity\u201d derives from ens, the\nLatin present participle for the verb to be, esse. No one has been more\nattentive than Heidegger to the di\ufb03culties caused by the translation of\nGreek thought into Latin. The Latin inheritance of \u201centity\u201d continues\nthe tradition of these di\ufb03culties. Once more, we face the problem of\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxix\n"

There is one major excep-\ntion to the translation of \u00eatant by \u201cbeing,\u201d and this is in Violence and\nMetaphysics, Derrida\u2019s essay on Emmanuel Levinas. The major work by\nLevinas under consideration in this essay, Totalit\u00e9 et In\ufb01ni, has been trans-\nlated into English. Since much of this work is concerned with\nHeidegger, I have maintained the translation of \u00e9tant as \u201cexistent\u201d\u2014the\nsolution chosen by Alphonso Lingis, the translator of Totality and In\ufb01nity\u2014\nin all citations from this work. This translation is particularly problem-\natical in that it tends to confuse the distinction (in terms of Being and\nTime) between the existential, ontological status of Being, and the ontical\nstatus of being. The reader is requested to read \u201cbeing\u201d for \u201cexistent\u201d\nwherever the latter appears.\nThis brings us to another term, one from Heidegger\u2019s later\nthought\u2014that of di\ufb00erence. From the existential analytic of Dasein\u2014\nman\u2019s Being\u2014in Being and Time, Heidegger moved to a contemplation of\nthe di\ufb00erence between beings and Being in his later works. He calls this\nthe ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence, and this idea itself is submitted to powerful\nscrutiny in his Identity and Di\ufb00erence. The title of this work alone should\nbring it to the attention of the serious reader of Writing and Di\ufb00erence; in\nthe introduction to \u201cFreud and the Scene of Writing\u201d Derrida gives a\nbrief indication of the importance of Identity and Di\ufb00erence to Writing and\nDi\ufb00erence when he speaks of \u201cdi\ufb00\u00e9rance and identity,\u201d \u201cdi\ufb00\u00e9rance as the pre-\nopening of the ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence.\u201d From Identity and Di\ufb00erence\nalso comes the term onto-theology which characterizes Western meta-\nphysics as such. Very roughly put, Heidegger analyzes the contradic-\ntions of the logic of presence which is forced to conceive Being as the\nmost general attribute of existence (onto-), and as the \u201chighest,\u201d most\nspeci\ufb01c attribute of God (theo-). Logos is the true verb: the spoken dis-\ncourse in which the notion of truth governed by this onto-theo-logy of\npresence is revealed. Also from Identity and Di\ufb00erence, among other places\nin Heidegger, comes the concept of di\ufb00erence as it is inscribed in the\n\u201contological double genitive,\u201d i.e., the necessary \ufb02uctuation of the\nsubjective and objective cases in order to speak of Being, which always\nmeans the Being of beings and the beings of Being.\nFrom Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, the work which immediately\nfollows Being and Time, comes the term \u201cauto-a\ufb00ection, which Derrida\nuses often, and which I have discussed brie\ufb02y in note 25 of \u201c\u2018Genesis\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxx\n"

From\nHeidegger\u2019s extended confrontation with Nietzsche\u2019s doctrine of the\nwill comes the concept of voluntarism. Throughout Writing and Di\ufb00erence\n\u201cvoluntarism\u201d must be read in its etymological sense of \u201cdoctrine of\nthe will,\u201d deriving as it does from the Latin voluntas (whence our \u201cvol-\nition\u201d). The French vouloir, to want, maintains its etymological reson-\nances in more striking fashion than do any of its English equivalents;\nDerrida plays on these resonances especially in connection with vouloir\ndire, which means either \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201cto mean,\u201d but has a strong\nconnotation of \u201cthe will to say.\u201d The concluding paragraphs of \u201cCogito\nand the History of Madness\u201d develop this point.\nHusserl\u2019s terms. The most important terms from Husserl are the linked\nconcepts of bracketing, epoch\u00e9, and the phenomenological reduction.\nThese are carefully explained in sections 31, 32, and 33 of Ideas (trans-\nlated by W. R. Boyce Gibson, New York: Macmillan, 1962). Husserl,\nfollowing Descartes\u2019s attempt to \ufb01nd absolutely certain truths by putt-\ning everything into doubt, proposes to put between brackets (or paren-\ntheses) \u201cthe general thesis which belongs to the essence of the natural\nstandpoint.\u201d This phenomenological \u201cabstention\u201d (epoch\u00e9) prohibits\nthe use of any \u201cjudgment that concerns spatio-temporal existence\u201d\n(Ideas, p. 100). \u201cPure consciousness\u201d becomes accessible through this\ntranscendental epoch\u00e9, which Husserl therefore speaks of as the phenom-\nenological reduction. The relationship of this \u201cpure consciousness\u201d\nto \u201cpure essences\u201d is governed by intentionality, for all consciousness is\nconsciousness of something, although again it is not a question of a\nrelationship to a psychological event (experience) or to a real object.\nSensory experience, the relationship to hyl\u00e9 (matter) contains nothing\nintentional for Husserl; it is intentional morph\u00e9 (form, shape) which\nbestows meaning on sensory experience. The opposition of hyl\u00e9 to\nmorph\u00e9 (matter to form) leads Husserl to divide \u201cphenomenological\nbeing\u201d into its hyletic and noetic (intentionally meaningful; from the\nGreek nous, meaning mind or spirit) sides.

As much of Ideas is\nconcerned with the theory of noetic-noematic structures, the reader\nwill appreciate the inadequacy of these remarks.\nHegel\u2019s terms. The most important term from Hegel, Aufhebung, is untrans-\nlatable due to its double meaning of conservation and negation. (The\nvarious attempts to translate Aufhebung into English seem inadequate.)\nThe reader is referred to Derrida\u2019s discussion of the term in \u201cViolence\nand Metaphysics,\u201d section III, \ufb01rst subsection (\u201cOf the Original\nPolemic), B, and to the translator\u2019s notes in \u201cFrom Restricted to General\nEconomy,\u201d where other terms from Hegel are discussed. The Hegelian\n\ufb01gure of the \u201cunhappy consciousness\u201d is discussed in note 23 of Vio-\nlence and Metaphysics, but there is also an important discussion of it at the\nbeginning of \u201cCogito and the History of Madness.\u201d The unhappy con-\nsciousness, for Hegel, is always divided against itself; its historical \ufb01g-\nure is Abraham, the prototype of the \u201cJewish\u201d consciousness for which\nthere is an intrinsic con\ufb02ict between God and nature. In many ways the\ntheme of the unhappy consciousness runs throughout Writing and Di\ufb00er-\nence. \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d is epigraphically submitted to the\ncon\ufb02ict between the Greek\u2014\u201chappy,\u201d at one with nature\u2014and the\nHebraic\u2014unhappy\u2014consciousnesses. Like all inherited oppositions, this\none too is programmed by the logic of presence which demands a\nchoice between the terms, or a resolution of the con\ufb02ict. Derrida\npushes the unhappy consciousness to its logical limits in order to bring\nit to the point where the division within it becomes irreducible. This\noccurs most importantly in the two essays devoted to Jab\u00e8s, whose\npoetry interrogates the meaning of the Jewish, divided consciousness.\nThis interrogation becomes particularly poignant for Derrida in its ties\nto the Jewish, unhappy consciousness as the experience of the (people\nof the) Book and Writing, for, as discussed above, these are the\ninherited concepts which are Derrida\u2019s central targets. Derrida has\nclosed each of the essays on Jab\u00e8s with the name of one of Jab\u00e8s\u2019s\nimaginary rabbis: Rida and Derissa. In this way he alerts us to the\n\u201clatent,\u201d philosophically \u201cunconscious\u201d impact of Writing and Di\ufb00erence:\nan expanded concept of di\ufb00erence through the examination of writing.\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxxii\n"

The structuralist\nsolicitude and solicitation give themselves only the illusion of technical\nliberty when they become methodical. In truth, they reproduce, in the\nregister of method, a solicitude and solicitation of Being, a historico-\nmetaphysical threatening of foundations. It is during the epochs of\nhistorical dislocation, when we are expelled from the site, that this\nstructuralist passion, which is simultaneously a frenzy of experimenta-\ntion and a proliferation of schematizations, develops for itself. The\nbaroque would only be one example of it. Has not a \u201cstructural\npoetics\u201d \u201cfounded on a rhetoric\u201d6 been mentioned in relation to the\nbaroque?

From his\n\ufb01rst page on, he links \u201cthe nature of the literary fact,\u201d always insu\ufb03-\nciently examined, to the \u201crole in art of imagination, that fundamental\nactivity\u201d about which \u201cuncertainties and oppositions abound.\u201d This\nnotion of an imagination that produces metaphor\u2014that is, everything in\nlanguage except the verb to be\u2014remains for critics what certain philo-\nsophers today call a naively utilized operative concept. To surmount this\ntechnical ingenuousness is to re\ufb02ect the operative concept as a thematic\nconcept. This seems to be one of Rousset\u2019s projects.\nTo grasp the operation of creative imagination at the greatest pos-\nsible proximity to it, one must turn oneself toward the invisible\ninterior of poetic freedom. One must be separated from oneself in\norder to be reunited with the blind origin of the work in its darkness.\nThis experience of conversion, which founds the literary act (writing\nor reading), is such that the very words \u201cseparation\u201d and \u201cexile,\u201d\nwhich always designate the interiority of a breaking-o\ufb00 with the world\nand a making of one\u2019s way within it, cannot directly manifest the\nexperience; they can only indicate it through a metaphor whose\ngenealogy itself would deserve all of our e\ufb00orts.18 For in question here\nis a departure from the world toward a place which is neither a non-place\nnor an other world, neither a utopia nor an alibi, the creation of \u201ca\nuniverse to be added to the universe,\u201d according to an expression of\nFocillon\u2019s cited by Rousset (Forme et Signi\ufb01cation, p. 11). This universe\narticulates only that which is in excess of everything, the essential\nnothing on whose basis everything can appear and be produced within\nlanguage; and the voice of Maurice Blanchot reminds us, with the\ninsistence of profundity, that this excess is the very possibility of writing\nand of literary inspiration in general. Only pure absence\u2014not the absence of\nthis or that, but the absence of everything in which all presence is\nannounced\u2014can inspire, in other words, can work, and then make one\nwork. The pure book naturally turns toward the eastern edge of this\nabsence which, beyond or within the prodigiousness of all wealth, is\nits \ufb01rst and proper content.

In a fragment of a book he intended to devote to The Origin of\nTruth, Merleau-Ponty wrote: \u201cCommunication in literature is not the\nsimple appeal on the part of the writer to meanings which would be\npart of an a priori of the mind; rather, communication arouses these\nmeanings in the mind through enticement and a kind of oblique\naction.

It does not know where it is going, no\nknowledge can keep it from the essential precipitation toward the\nmeaning that it constitutes and that is, primarily, its future. However, it\nis capricious only through cowardice. There is thus no insurance\nagainst the risk of writing. Writing is an initial and graceless recourse\nfor the writer, even if he is not an atheist but, rather, a writer. Did Saint\nJohn Chrysostom speak of the writer? \u201cIt were indeed meet for us not\nat all to require the aid of the written Word, but to exhibit a life so\npure, that the grace of the spirit should be instead of books to our\nsouls, and that as these are inscribed with ink, even so should our\nhearts be with the Spirit.

And, paradoxically, inscription alone\u2014\nalthough it is far from always doing so\u2014has the power of poetry, in\nother words has the power to arouse speech from its slumber as sign.\nBy enregistering speech, inscription has as its essential objective, and\nindeed takes this fatal risk, the emancipation of meaning\u2014as concerns\nany actual \ufb01eld of perception\u2014from the natural predicament in which\neverything refers to the disposition of a contingent situation. This is\nwhy writing will never be simple \u201cvoice-painting\u201d (Voltaire).

The will to write is not an ulterior determination of a primal will.\nOn the contrary, the will to write reawakens the willful sense of the\nwill: freedom, break with the domain of empirical history, a break\nwhose aim is reconciliation with the hidden essence of the empirical,\nwith pure historicity. The will and the attempt to write are not the\nforce and signification\n13\n"

In its relationship to Being, the attempt-to-write poses itself\nas the only way out of a\ufb00ectivity. A way out that can only be aimed at,\nand without the certainty that deliverance is possible or that it is out-\nside a\ufb00ectivity. To be a\ufb00ected is to be \ufb01nite: to write could still be to\ndeceive \ufb01nitude, and to reach Being\u2014a kind of Being which could\nneither be, nor a\ufb00ect me by itself\u2014from without existence. To write\nwould be to attempt to forget di\ufb00erence: to forget writing in the pres-\nence of so-called living and pure speech.35\nIn the extent to which the literary act proceeds from this attempt-to-\nwrite, it is indeed the acknowledgment of pure language, the responsi-\nbility confronting the vocation of \u201cpure\u201d speech which, once\nunderstood, constitutes the writer as such. Heidegger says of pure\nspeech that it cannot \u201cbe conceived in the rigor of its essence\u201d on the\nbasis of its \u201ccharacter-as-sign\u201d (Zeichencharakter), \u201cnor even perhaps of\nits character-as-signi\ufb01cation\u201d (Bedeutungscharakter).36\nDoes not one thus run the risk of identifying the work with original\nwriting in general? Of dissolving the notion of art and the value of\n\u201cbeauty\u201d by which literature is currently distinguished from the letter\nin general? But perhaps by removing the speci\ufb01city of beauty from\naesthetic values, beauty is, on the contrary, liberated? Is there a\nspeci\ufb01city of beauty, and would beauty gain from this e\ufb00ort?\nRousset believes so. And the structuralism proper to Jean Rousset is\nde\ufb01ned, at least theoretically, against the temptation to overlook this\nspeci\ufb01city (the temptation that would be Poulet\u2019s, for example, since\nhe \u201chas little interest in art\u201d),37 putting Rousset close to Leo Spitzer and\nMarcel Raymond in his scrupulousness about the formal autonomy of\nthe work\u2014an \u201cindependent, absolute organism that is self-su\ufb03cient\u201d\n(Forme et Signi\ufb01cation p. xx). \u201cThe work is a totality and always gains from\nbeing experienced as such\u201d (p. xxi). But here again, Rousset\u2019s position\ndepends upon a delicate balance. Always attentive to the uni\ufb01ed foun-\ndations of dissociation, he circumvents the \u201cobjectivist\u201d danger\ndenounced by Poulet by giving a de\ufb01nition of structure that is not\npurely objective or formal; or circumvents the \u201cobjectivist\u201d danger\ndenounced by Poulet by giving a de\ufb01nition of structure that is not\npurely objective or formal; or circumvents it by at least not in principle\ndissociating form from intention, or from the very act of the writer: \u201cI\nwriting and difference\n14\n"

For example: after having\nbrought to light the necessity of repetition in Proustian composition,\nRousset writes: \u201cWhatever one thinks of the device which introduces\nUn amour de Swann, it is quickly forgotten, so tight and organic is the\nliaison that connects the part to the whole. Once one has \ufb01nished\nreading the Recherche, one perceives that the episode is not at all isolable;\nwithout it, the ensemble would be unintelligible. Un amour de Swann is a\nnovel within a novel, a painting within a painting . . ., it brings to mind,\nnot the stories within stories that so many seventeenth- or eighteenth-\ncentury novelists encase in their narratives, but rather the inner stories\nthat can be read the Vie de Marianne, in Balzac or Gide. At one of the\nentryways to his novel, Proust places a small convex mirror which\nre\ufb02ects the novel in abbreviated form\u201d (p. 146). The metaphor and\noperation of encasement impose themselves, even if they are \ufb01nally\nreplaced by a \ufb01ner, more adequate image which, at bottom, signi\ufb01es\nthe same relationship of implication. A re\ufb02ecting and representative\nkind of implication, this time.\nIt is for these same reasons that Rousset\u2019s aesthetic is aligned with\nClaudel\u2019s. Moreover, Proust\u2019s aesthetic is de\ufb01ned at the beginning of\nthe essay on Claudel. And the a\ufb03nities are evident, above and beyond\nall the di\ufb00erences. These a\ufb03nities are assembled in the theme of\n\u201cstructural monotony\u201d: \u201c\u2018And thinking once more about the mon-\notony of Vinteuil\u2019s works, I explained to Albertine that great writers\nhave created only a single work, or rather have refracted the same\nbeauty that they bring to the world through diverse elements\u2019\u201d\n(p. 171). Claudel: \u201c\u2018Le soulier de satin is T\u00eate d\u2019or in another form. It\nsummarizes both T\u00eate d\u2019or and Partage de midi. It is even the conclusion\nof Partage de midi . . . \u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018A poet does hardly anything but develop a\npreestablished plan\u2019\u201d (p. 172).\nThis aesthetic which neutralizes duration and force as the di\ufb00erence\nbetween the acorn and the oak, is not autonomously Proust\u2019s or\nClaudel\u2019s. It translates a metaphysics. Proust also calls \u201ctime in its pure\nstate\u201d the \u201catemporal\u201d or the \u201ceternal.\u201d The truth of time is not tem-\nporal. Analogously (analogously only), time as irreversible succession,\nis, according to Claudel, only the phenomenon, the epidermis, the\nsurface image of the essential truth of the universe as it is conceived\nforce and signification\n27\n"

That the aesthetics they govern can be\nlegitimately and fruitfully applied to the reading of Proust or Claudel is\nevident, for these are their aesthetics, daughter (or mother) of their\nmetaphysics. It is also readily demonstrable that what is in question is\nthe metaphysics implicit in all structuralism, or in every structuralist\nproposition. In particular, a structuralist reading, by its own activity,\nalways presupposes and appeals to the theological simultaneity of the\nbook, and considers itself deprived of the essential when this simul-\ntaneity is not accessible. Rousset: \u201cIn any event, reading, which is\ndeveloped in duration, will have to make the work simultaneously\npresent in all its parts in order to be global. . . . Similar to a \u2018painting in\nmovement,\u2019 the book is revealed only in successive fragments. The task\nof the demanding reader consists in overturning this natural tendency\nof the book, so that it may present itself in its entirety to the mind\u2019s\nscrutiny. The only complete reading is the one which transforms the\nbook into a simultaneous network of reciprocal relationships: it is then\nthat surprises emerge\u201d (p. xiii). (What surprises? How can simul-\ntaneity hold surprises in store? Rather, it neutralizes the surprises of\nnonsimultaneity. Surprises emerge from the dialogue between the\nsimultaneous and the nonsimultaneous. Which su\ufb03ces to say that\nstructural simultaneity itself serves to reassure.) Jean-Pierre Richard:\n\u201cThe di\ufb03culty of every structural account resides in that it must\ndescribe sequentially, successively, that which in fact exists all at once,\nsimultaneously\u201d (L\u2019univers imaginaire de Mallarm\u00e9, p. 28). Thus, Rousset\ninvokes the di\ufb03culty of gaining access to the simultaneity which is\ntruth within reading, and Richard the di\ufb03culty of accounting for it\nwriting and difference\n28\n"

To comprehend the\nstructure of a becoming, the form of a force, is to lose meaning by\n\ufb01nding it. The meaning of becoming and of force, by virtue of their\npure, intrinsic characteristics, is the repose of the beginning and the\nend, the peacefulness of a spectacle, horizon or face.56 Within this\npeace and repose the character of becoming and of force is disturbed\nby meaning itself. The meaning of meaning is Apollonian by virtue of\neverything within it that can be seen.57\nTo say that force is the origin of the phenomenon is to say nothing.\nBy its very articulation force becomes a phenomenon. Hegel demon-\nstrated convincingly that the explication of a phenomenon by a force is\na tautology.58 But in saying this, one must refer to language\u2019s peculiar\ninability to emerge from itself in order to articulate its origin, and not\nto the thought of force. Force is the other of language without which\nlanguage would not be what it is.\nIn order to respect this strange movement within language, in order\nnot to reduce it in turn, we would have to attempt a return to the\nmetaphor of darkness and light (of self-revelation and self-\nconcealment), the founding metaphor of Western philosophy as meta-\nphysics. The founding metaphor not only because it is a photological\none\u2014and in this respect the entire history of our philosophy is a pho-\ntology, the name given to a history of, or treatise on, light\u2014but because\nit is a metaphor.

I would\nprefer dissension, to underline that in question is a self-dividing action, a\ncleavage and torment interior to meaning in general, interior to logos in\ngeneral, a divison within the very act of sentire. As always, the dissension\nis internal. The exterior (is) the interior, is the \ufb01ssion that produces and\ndivides it along the lines of the Hegelian Entzweiung.\nIt thus seems that the project of convoking the \ufb01rst dissension of\nlogos against itself is quite another project than the archaeology of\nsilence, and raises di\ufb00erent questions. This time it would be necessary\nto exhume the virgin and unitary ground upon which the decisive act\nlinking and separating madness and reason obscurely took root. The\nreason and madness of the classical age had a common root. But this\ncommon root, which is a logos, this unitary foundation is much more\nancient than the medieval period, brilliantly but brie\ufb02y evoked by\nFoucault in his very \ufb01ne opening chapter. There must be a founding\nunity that already carries within it the \u201cfree trade\u201d of the Middle Ages,\nand this unity is already the unity of a logos, that is, of a reason; an\nalready historical reason certainly, but a reason much less determined\nthan it will be in its so-called classical form, having not yet received the\ndeterminations of the \u201cclassical age.\u201d It is within the element of this\narchaic reason that the dissection, the dissension, will present itself as a\nmodi\ufb01cation or, if you will, as an overturning, that is, a revolution but\nan internal revolution, a revolution a\ufb00ecting the self, occurring within\nthe self. For this logos which is in the beginning, is not only the\ncommon ground of all dissension, but also\u2014and no less importantly\u2014\nthe very atmosphere in which Foucault\u2019s language moves, the atmos-\nphere in which a history of madness during the classical age not only\nappears in fact but is also by all rights stipulated and speci\ufb01ed in terms of\nits limits. In order to account simultaneously for the origin (or the\npossibility) of the decision and for the origin (or the possibility) of its\nnarration, it might have been necessary to start by re\ufb02ecting this ori-\nginal logos in which the violence of the classical era played itself out.\nThis history of logos before the Middle Ages and before the classical\nage is not, if this need be said at all, a nocturnal and mute prehistory.\nwriting and difference\n46\n"

It is bothersome because at the outset Foucault makes a some-\nwhat enigmatic allusion to the Greek logos, saying that, unlike classical\nreason, it \u201chad no contrary.\u201d To cite Foucault: \u201cThe Greeks had a\nrelation to something that they called hybris. This relation was not\nmerely one of condemnation; the existence of Thrasymacus or of Cal-\nlicles su\ufb03ces to prove it, even if their language has reached us already\nenveloped in the reassuring dialectic of Socrates. But the Greek Logos\nhad no contrary.\u201d8\n[One would have to assume, then, that the Greek logos had no\ncontrary, which is to say, brie\ufb02y, that the Greeks were in the greatest\nproximity to the elementary, primordial, and undivided Logos with\nrespect to which contradiction in general, all wars or polemics, could\nonly be ulterior developments. This hypothesis forces us to admit, as\nFoucault above all does not, that the history and lineage of the \u201creassur-\ning dialectic of Socrates\u201d in their totality had already fallen outside and\nbeen exiled from this Greek logos that had no contrary. For if the\nSocratic dialectic is reassuring, in the sense understood by Foucault, it\nis so only in that it has already expulsed, excluded, objecti\ufb01ed or (curi-\nously amounting to the same thing) assimilated and mastered as one of\nits moments, \u201cenveloped\u201d the contrary of reason; and also only in that\nit has tranquilized and reassured itself into a pre-Cartesian certainty, a\nsophrosyne, a wisdom, a reasonable good sense and prudence.\nConsequently, it must be either (a) that the Socratic moment and its\nentire posterity immediately partake in the Greek logos that has no\ncontrary; and that consequently, the Socratic dialectic could not be\nreassuring (we may soon have occasion to show that it is no more\nreassuring than the Cartesian cogito). In this case, in this hypothesis,\nthe fascination with the pre-Socratics to which we have been provoked\nby Nietzsche, then by Heidegger and several others, would carry with\nit a share of mysti\ufb01cation whose historico-philosophical motivations\ncogito and the history of madness\n47\n"

It would be essential\nto the entirety of the history of philosophy and of reason. In this\nregard, the classical age could have neither speci\ufb01city nor privilege.\nAnd all the signs assembled by Foucault under the chapter heading\nStultifera navis would play themselves out only on the surface of a chronic\ndissension. The free circulation of the mad, besides the fact that it is not\nas simply free as all that, would only be a socioeconomic epiphenom-\nenon on the surface of a reason divided against itself since the dawn of\nits Greek origin.

This is the heart of the matter. Permit\nme to hold o\ufb00 on this question.\nHowever one interprets the situation of classical reason, notably as\nregards the Greek logos (and whether or not this latter experienced\ndissension) in all cases a doctrine of tradition, of the tradition of logos (is\nthere any other?) seems to be the prerequisite implied by Foucault\u2019s\nenterprise.

A problem of translation, a philo-\nsophical problem of translation is posed\u2014and it is serious\u2014even if Hybris\nis not Madness for Foucault. The determination of their di\ufb00erence sup-\nposes a hazardous linguistic transition. The frequent imprudence of\ntranslators in this respect should make us very wary. I am thinking in\nparticular, and in passing, of what is translated by madness and fury in\nthe Philebus (45e).9 Further, if madness has an invariable meaning, what\nis the relation of this meaning to the a posteriori events which govern\nFoucault\u2019s analysis? For, despite everything, even if his method is not\nempiricist, Foucault proceeds by inquiry and inquest. What he is writ-\ning is a history, and the recourse to events, in the last resort, is\nindispensable and determining, at least in principle. Now, is not the\nconcept of madness\u2014never submitted to a thematic scrutiny by\nFoucault\u2014today a false and disintegrated concept, outside current and\npopular language which always lags longer than it should behind its\nsubversion by science and philosophy? Foucault, in rejecting the psy-\nchiatric or philosophical material that has always emprisoned the mad,\nwinds up employing\u2014inevitably\u2014a popular and equivocal notion of\nmadness, taken from an unveri\ufb01able source. This would not be serious\nif Foucault used the word only in quotation marks, as if it were the\nlanguage of others, of those who, during the period under study, used\nit as a historical instrument. But everything transpires as if Foucault\nknew what \u201cmadness\u201d means. Everything transpires as if, in a continu-\nous and underlying way, an assured and rigorous precomprehension of\nthe concept of madness, or at least of its nominal de\ufb01nition, were\npossible and acquired. In fact, however, it could be demonstrated that\nas Foucault intends it, if not as intended by the historical current he is\nstudying, the concept of madness overlaps everything that can be put\nunder the rubric of negativity. One can imagine the kind of problems\nposed by such a usage of the notion of madness. The same kind of\nquestions could be posed concerning the notion of truth that runs\nthroughout the book . . . I close this long parenthesis.) Thus, whatever\nthe relation of the Greeks to hybris, and of Socrates to the original logos,\nit is in any event certain that classical reason, and medieval reason\nbefore it, bore a relation to Greek reason, and that it is within the\ncogito and the history of madness\n49\n"

And for the same reason, although these general\nthings, to wit, a body, eyes, a head, hands, and such like, may be\nimaginary, we are bound at the same time to confess that there are at\nleast some other objects yet more simple and more universal, which\nare real and true; and of these just in the same way as with certain real\ncolours, all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts,\nwhether true and real or false and fantastic, are formed.\nTo such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general, and\nits extension, the \ufb01gure of extended things, their quantity or magni-\ntude and number, as also the place in which they are, the time which\nmeasures their duration, and so on.\nThat is possibly why our reasoning is not unjust when we conclude\nfrom this that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine and all other sciences\nwhich have as their end the consideration of composite things, are\nvery dubious and uncertain; but that Arithmetic, Geometry and other\nsciences of that kind which only treat of things that are very simple and\nvery general, without taking great trouble to ascertain whether they are\nactually existent or not, contain some measure of certainty and an\nelement of the indubitable. For whether I am awake or asleep, two and\nthree together always form \ufb01ve, and the square can never have more\nthan four sides, and it does not seem possible that truths so clear and\napparent can be suspected of any falsity.13\ncogito and the history of madness\n59\n"

I will therefore\npropose a hypothesis which will seem much more natural to you, will\nnot disorient you, because it concerns a more common, and more\nuniversal experience than that of madness: the experience of sleep and\ndreams. Descartes then elaborates the hypothesis that will ruin all the\nsensory foundations of knowledge and will lay bare only the intellectual\nfoundations of certainty. This hypothesis above all will not run from\nthe possibility of an insanity\u2014an epistemological one\u2014much more\nserious than madness.\nThe reference to dreams is therefore not put o\ufb00 to one side\u2014quite\nthe contrary\u2014in relation to a madness potentially respected or even\nexcluded by Descartes. It constitutes, in the methodical order which\nhere is ours, the hyperbolical exasperation of the hypothesis of mad-\nness. This latter a\ufb00ected only certain areas of sensory perception, and in\na contingent and partial way. Moreover, Descartes is concerned here\nnot with determining the concept of madness but with utilizing the\npopular notion of insanity for juridical and methodological ends, in\norder to ask questions of principle regarding only the truth of ideas.15\nWhat must be grasped here is that from this point of view the sleeper, or the\ndreamer, is madder than the madman. Or, at least, the dreamer, insofar\ncogito and the history of madness\n61\n"

Or, while assuming our hypothesis, Foucault could also recall the\nfollowing: Descartes, by inscribing his reference to madness within the\nproblematic of knowledge, by making madness not only a thing of\nthe body but an error of the body, by concerning himself with madness\nonly as the modi\ufb01cation of ideas, or the faculties of representation or\njudgment, intends to neutralize the originality of madness. He would\neven, in the long run, be condemned to construe it, like all errors, not\nonly as an epistemological de\ufb01ciency but also as a moral failure linked\nto a precipitation of the will; for will alone can consecrate the intel-\nlectual \ufb01nitude of perception as error. It is only one step from here to\nmaking madness a sin, a step that was soon after cheerfully taken, as\nFoucault convincingly demonstrates in other chapters.\nFoucault would be perfectly correct in recalling these two truths to\nus if we were to remain at the na\u00efve, natural, and premetaphysical stage\nof Descartes\u2019s itinerary, the stage marked by natural doubt as it inter-\nvenes in the passage that Foucault cites. However, it seems that these\ntwo truths become vulnerable in turn, as soon as we come to the\nproperly philosophical, metaphysical, and critical phase of doubt.16\nLet us \ufb01rst notice how, in the rhetoric of the \ufb01rst Meditation, the \ufb01rst\ntoutefois [at the same time] which announced the \u201cnatural\u201d hyperbole of\ndreams (just after Descartes says, \u201cBut they are mad, and I should not\nbe any the less insane,\u201d etc.) is succeeded by a second toutefois [never-\ntheless] at the beginning of the next paragraph.17 To \u201cat the same\ntime,\u201d marking the hyperbolical moment within natural doubt, will correspond\na \u201cnevertheless,\u201d marking the absolutely hyperbolical moment which gets us\nout of natural doubt and leads to the hypothesis of the evil genius.\nDescartes has just admitted that arithmetic, geometry, and simple\nnotions escape the \ufb01rst doubt, and he writes, \u201cNevertheless I have long\nhad \ufb01xed in my mind the belief that an all-powerful God existed by\nwhom I have been created such as I am.\u201d18 This is the onset of the\nwell-known movement leading to the \ufb01ction of the evil genius.\nNow, the recourse to the \ufb01ction of the evil genius will evoke,\nconjure up, the possibility of a total madness, a total derangement over\nwhich I could have no control because it is in\ufb02icted upon me\u2014\nhypothetically\u2014leaving me no responsibility for it.

Descartes not\nonly ceases to reject madness during the phase of radical doubt, he not\nonly installs its possible menace at the very heart of the intelligible, he\nalso in principle refuses to let any determined knowledge escape from\nmadness. A menace to all knowledge, insanity\u2014the hypothesis of\ninsanity\u2014is not an internal modi\ufb01cation of knowledge. At no point will\nknowledge alone be able to dominate madness, to master it in order to\nobjectify it\u2014at least for as long as doubt remains unresolved. For the\nend of doubt poses a problem to which we shall return in a moment.\nThe act of the Cogito and the certainty of existing indeed escape\nmadness the \ufb01rst time; but aside from the fact that for the \ufb01rst time, it is\nno longer a question of objective, representative knowledge, it can no\nlonger literally be said that the Cogito would escape madness because it\nkeeps itself beyond the grasp of madness, or because, as Foucault says,\n\u201cI who think, I cannot be mad\u201d; the Cogito escapes madness only\nbecause at its own moment, under its own authority, it is valid even if I\nam mad, even if my thoughts are completely mad. There is a value and a\nmeaning of the Cogito, as of existence, which escape the alternative of\na determined madness or a determined reason. Confronted with the\ncritical experience of the Cogito, insanity, as stated in the Discourse on\nMethod, is irremediably on a plane with scepticism. Thought no longer\nfears madness: \u201c . . . remarking that this truth \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019 was\nso certain and so assured that all the most extravagant suppositions\nbrought forward by the sceptics were incapable of shaking it.\u201d23 The\ncertainty thus attained need not be sheltered from an emprisoned\nmadness, for it is attained and ascertained within madness itself. It is\nvalid even if I am mad\u2014a supreme self-con\ufb01dence that seems to require\nneither the exclusion nor the circumventing of madness. Descartes\nnever interns madness, neither at the stage of natural doubt nor at the\nstage of metaphysical doubt. He only claims to exclude it during the \ufb01rst phase of\nthe \ufb01rst stage, during the nonhyperbolical moment of natural doubt.\nThe hyperbolical audacity of the Cartesian Cogito, its mad audacity,\nwhich we perhaps no longer perceive as such because, unlike Des-\ncartes\u2019s contemporary, we are too well assured of ourselves and too\nwell accustomed to the framework of the Cogito, rather than to the\ncritical experience of it\u2014its mad audacity would consist in the return to\ncogito and the history of madness\n67\n"

This identi\ufb01cation inter-\nvenes from the moment when Descartes determines natural light (which in\nits undetermined source should be valid even for the mad), from the\nmoment when he pulls himself out of madness by determining natural\nlight through a series of principles and axioms (axiom of causality\naccording to which there must be at least as much reality in the cause\nas in the e\ufb00ect; then, after this axiom permits the proof of the existence\nof God, the axioms that \u201cthe light of nature teaches us that fraud and\ndeception necessarily proceed from some defect\u201d).29 These dogmatic-\nally determined axioms escape doubt, are never even submitted to its\nscrutiny, are established only reciprocally, on the basis of the existence\nand truthfulness of God. Due to this fact, they fall within the province\nof the history of knowledge and the determined structures of phil-\nosophy. This is why the act of the Cogito, at the hyperbolical moment\nwhen it pits itself against madness, or rather lets itself be pitted against\nmadness, must be repeated and distinguished from the language or\nthe deductive system in which Descartes must inscribe it as soon as he\nproposes it for apprehension and communication, that is, as soon as he\nre\ufb02ects the Cogito for the other, which means for oneself. It is through\nthis relationship to the other as an other self that meaning reassures\nitself against madness and nonmeaning. And philosophy is perhaps the\nreassurance given against the anguish of being mad at the point of\ngreatest proximity to madness. This silent and speci\ufb01c moment could\nbe called pathetic. As for the functioning of the hyperbole in the struc-\nture of Descartes\u2019s discourse and in the order of reasons, our reading is\ntherefore, despite all appearances to the contrary, profoundly aligned\nwith Foucault\u2019s.

And in truth,\nHusserl increasingly associated the theme of normality with the theme\nof the transcendental reduction.

Indeed, it is exactly the\ncontrary that I am proposing. In question is a way of accounting for the\nvery historicity of philosophy.

This rhythm, moreover, is not an alternation\nthat additionally would be temporal. It is rather the movement of tem-\nporalization itself as concerns that which unites it to the movement of\nlogos.

Despite\nthe most profound dissimilarities, the appeal to tradition\u2014which is in\nno way traditional\u2014is shaped by an intention common to Husserlian\nphenomenology and to what we will call provisionally, by approxima-\ntion and for reasons of economy, Heideggerean \u201contology.\u201d3\nThus, very brie\ufb02y:\n1. The entirety of philosophy is conceived on the basis of its Greek\nsource. As is well known, this amounts neither to an occidental-\nism, nor to a historicism.4 It is simply that the founding concepts\nof philosophy are primarily Greek, and it would not be possible to\nphilosophize, or to speak philosophically, outside this medium.\nThat Plato, for Husserl, was the founder of a reason and a philo-\nsophical task whose telos was still sleeping in the shadows; or that\nfor Heidegger, on the contrary, Plato marks the moment at which\nthe thought of Being forgets itself and is determined as\nphilosophy\u2014this di\ufb00erence is decisive only at the culmination of\na common root which is Greek. The di\ufb00erence is fraternal in its\nposterity, entirely submitted to the same domination. Domination\nof the same too, which will disappear neither in phenomenology\nnor in \u201contology.\u201d\n2. The archaeology to which Husserl and Heidegger lead us by dif-\nferent paths entails, for both, a subordination or transgression, in\nany event a reduction of metaphysics. Even though, for each, this\ngesture has an entirely di\ufb00erent meaning, or at least does so\napparently.\n3. Finally, the category of the ethical is not only dissociated from\nmetaphysics but coordinated with something other than itself, a\nprevious and more radical function.

For example, the consciousness of crisis\nis for Husserl but the provisional, almost necessary covering up of a\ntranscendental motif which in Descartes and in Kant was already\nbeginning to accomplish the Greek aim: philosophy as science.

Especially as concerns the violence implicit in\nphenomenology.\n(b) Next, it is di\ufb03cult to overlook the fact that Husserl so little pre-\ndetermined Being as object that in Ideas I absolute existence is\naccorded only to pure consciousness. True, it has often been\nargued that the di\ufb00erence hardly counts, and that a philosophy of\nconsciousness is always a philosophy of the object. Levinas\u2019s read-\ning of Husserl on this point has always been nuanced, supple,\ncontrasted. As early as in the Theory of Intuition, theory is correctly\ndistinguished from objectivity in general. As we shall see later,\npractical, axiological, etc., consciousness is for Husserl too a\nconsciousness of the object. Levinas openly acknowledges this.\nTherefore, the accusation is really directed against the irreducible\nprimacy of the subject-object correlation. But, later, Levinas will\ninsist more and more on those aspects of Husserlian phenomen-\nology which take us to the inner or outer reaches of the \u201csubject-\nobject correlation.\u201d For example, this would be \u201cintentionality\nas a relationship with otherness,\u201d as an \u201cexteriority which is\nnot objective,\u201d sensibility, passive genesis, the movement of\ntemporalization, etc.11\n(c) Further, for Levinas the sun of the epekeina tes ousias will always\nilluminate the pure awakening and inexhaustible source of\nthought (TI, p.127). It is not only the Greek ancestor of the In\ufb01nite\nwhich transcends totality (the totality of being or of noema, the\ntotality of the same or the ego),12 but is also the instrument of\ndestruction for the phenomenology and ontology subjected to the\nneutral totality of the Same as Being or as Ego. All the essays in\n1947 grouped under the title De l\u2019existence \u00e0 l\u2019existant will be placed\nunder the sign of \u201cthe Platonic formulation placing the Good\nviolence and metaphysics 105\n"

In 1947 Levinas calls this movement, which is\nnot theological, not a transcendence toward \u201ca superior exist-\nence,\u201d \u201cex-cendence.\u201d With a foothold in being, excendence is a\n\u201cdeparture from being and from the categories which describe\nit.\u201d This ethical excendence designates the site\u2014rather the non-\nsite\u2014of metaphysics as metatheology, metaontology, metaphe-\nnomenology. We will have to return to this reading of the epekeina\ntes ousias and its relationship to ontology. Since we are speaking of\nlight, let us note for the moment that the Platonic movement is\ninterpreted such that it leads no longer to the sun but even beyond\nlight and Being, beyond the light of Being. \u201cWe thus encounter in\nour own way the Platonic idea of the Good beyond Being,\u201d we read at\nthe end of Totality and In\ufb01nity (p. 293\u2013my italics), concerning cre-\nation and fecundity. In our own way, which is to say that ethical\nexcendence is not projected toward the neutrality of the good, but\ntoward the Other, and that which (is) epekeina tes ousias is not essen-\ntially light but fecundity or generosity. Creation is but creation of\nthe other; it can be only as paternity, and the relations of the father\nto son escape all the logical, ontological, and phenomenological\ncategories in which the absoluteness of the other is necessarily the\nsame. (But did not the Platonic sun already enlighten the visible\nsun, and did not excendence play upon the meta-phor of these\ntwo suns? Was not the Good the necessarily nocturnal source of all\nlight? The light of light beyond light. The heart of light is black, as\nhas often been noticed.13 Further, Plato\u2019s sun does not only\nenlighten: it engenders. The good is the father of the visible\nsun which provides living beings with \u201ccreation, growth and\nnourishment\u201d Republic, 508a\u2014509b.)\n(d) Finally, Levinas is certainly quite attentive to everything in Hus-\nserl\u2019s analyses which tempers or complicates the primordiality of\ntheoretical consciousness. In a paragraph devoted to nontheoretical\nconsciousness, it is acknowledged that the primacy of objectivity in\ngeneral is not necessarily confused, in Ideas I, with the primacy of\nthe theoretical attitude.

That is, by the spatial\npair inside-outside (but is this, in all its aspects, a spatial pair?) which\ngives life to the opposition of subject and object. By allegedly reducing\nthis last schema, Heidegger would have retained what made it possible\nand necessary: light, unveiling, comprehension or precomprehension.\nThis is what the texts written after En d\u00e9couvrant l\u2019existence tell us.\n\u201cHeideggerean care, illuminated as it is by comprehension (even if\ncomprehension o\ufb00ers itself as care), is already determined by the struc-\nture \u2018inside-outside\u2019 that characterizes light.\u201d In making the structure\n\u201cinside-outside\u201d tremble at the point where it would have resisted\nHeidegger, Levinas in no way pretends to erase it, or to deny its mean-\ning and existence.

In the style by which\nstrong and faithful thought is recognized (this is Heidegger\u2019s style\ntoo), Levinas respects the zone or layer of traditional truth; and the\nphilosophies whose presuppositions he describes are in general neither\nrefuted nor criticized. Here, for example, it is a question simply of\nrevealing beneath this truth, as that which founds it and is dissimulated\nwithin it, \u201ca situation which precedes the division of Being into an\nviolence and metaphysics 109\n"

But this play of the same is\nnot monotonous, is not repeated as monologue and formal tautology.\nAs the work of identi\ufb01cation and the concrete production of egoity, it\nentails a certain negativity. A \ufb01nite negativity, an internal and relative\nmodi\ufb01cation through which the ego a\ufb00ects itself by itself, within its\nown movement of identi\ufb01cation. Thus it alters itself toward itself\nwithin itself. The resistance to work, by provoking it, remains a\nmoment of the same, a \ufb01nite moment that forms a system and a totality\nwith the agent. It necessarily follows, then, that Levinas will describe\nhistory as a blinding to the other, and as the laborious procession of the\nsame. One may wonder whether history can be history, if there is history,\nwhen negativity is enclosed within the circle of the same, and when\nwork does not truly meet alterity, providing itself with its own resist-\nance. One wonders whether history itself does not begin with this\nrelationship to the other which Levinas places beyond history. The\nframework of this question should govern the entire reading of Totality\nand In\ufb01nity. In any event, one observes the displacement of the concept\nof historicity of which we spoke above. It must be acknowledged that\nwithout this displacement no anti-Hegelianism could be logically con-\nsequent.

This is a situation he must share with all anti-\nHegelian thinkers, and whose \ufb01nal signi\ufb01cance calls for much thought.\nHere, in particular, on the relations between desire and the eye,\nbetween sound and theory, the convergence is as profound as the\ndi\ufb00erence, being neither simply added to nor juxtaposed with it. In\ne\ufb00ect, like Levinas Hegel thought that the eye, not aiming at \u201ccon-\nsumption,\u201d suspends desire. It is the very limit of desire (and perhaps,\nthereby, its resource) and is the \ufb01rst theoretical sense. We must not\nconceive light and the eye\u2019s opening on the basis of any physiology,\nbut on the basis of the relation between death and desire. After having\nspoken of taste, touch, and smell, Hegel again writes, in the Aesthetics:\n\u201cSight, on the other hand, possesses a purely ideal relation to objects by\nmeans of light, a material which is at the same time immaterial, and\nwhich su\ufb00ers on its part the objects to continue in their free self-\nsubsistence, making them appear and reappear, but which does not, as\nthe atmosphere or \ufb01re does, consume them actively either by imper-\nceptible degrees or patently. Everything, then is an object of the\nappetiteless vision, [la vue exempte de d\u00e9sirs] which, however, in so far\nas it remains unimpaired in its integrity, merely is disclosed in its form\nand colour.\u201d29\nThis neutralization of desire is what makes sight excellent for Hegel.\nBut for Levinas, this neutralization is also, and for the same reasons, the\n\ufb01rst violence, even though the face is not what it is when the glance is\nabsent. Violence, then, would be the solitude of a mute glance, of a face\nwithout speech, the abstraction of seeing. According to Levinas the glance\nby itself, contrary to what one may be led to believe, does not respect the\nother. Respect, beyond grasp and contact, beyond touch, smell and\nviolence and metaphysics 123\n"

This is a question also posed by\nHegel, admiring the word Sinn.)\nIn Totality and In\ufb01nity the movement of metaphysics is thus also the\ntranscendence of hearing in relation to seeing. But in Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics\ntoo: \u201cThe remaining ideal sense is hearing. This is in signal contrast to\nthe one just described. Hearing is concerned with the tone, rather than\nthe form and colour of an object, with the vibration of what is corpor-\neal; it requires no process of dissolution, as the sense of smell requires,\nbut merely a trembling of the object, by which the same is in no wise\nimpoverished. This ideal motion, in which through its sound what is\nas it were the simple individuality [subjectivit\u00e9] the soul of the material\nthing expresses itself, the ear receives also in an ideal way, just as the\neye shape and colour, and su\ufb00ers thereby what is ideal or not external\nin the object to appeal to what is spiritual or non-corporeal.\u201d30 But:\nHearing, which, as also the sight, does not belong to the senses of\naction [sens pratiques] but those of contemplation [sens th\u00e9oriques]; and\nis, in fact, still more ideal than sight.

The ear, on\nthe contrary, receives the result of that ideal vibration of material sub-\nstance, without placing itself in a practical relation towards the\nobjects, a result by means of which it is no longer the material object\nin its repose, but the \ufb01rst example of the more ideal activity of the soul\nitself which is apprehended.31\nThe question of the analogy would thus lead us back to the notion of\ntrembling, which seems to us decisive in Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics in that it opens\nwriting and difference\n124\n"

We would have to examine this thought of the other in\ngeneral (which is not a genre), the Greek thought within which this\nnonspeci\ufb01c di\ufb00erence realizes (itself in) our history. Or, rather: what does\nautre mean before its Greek determination as heteron, and its Judeo-\nChristian determination as autrui? This is the kind of question which\nLevinas seems to contest profoundly: according to him, only the irrup-\ntion of the Other permits access to the absolute and to the irreducible\nalterity of the other. We would have to examine, therefore, this Huic of\nautrui whose transcendence is not yet that of a thou. Here, Levinas\u2019s\nopposition to Buber or to Gabriel Marcel becomes meaningful. After\nopposing the magisterial height of the You to the intimate reciprocity of\nthe Me-Thou (TI), Levinas seems to move toward a philosophy of the\nIlle, of the He (Il) in his meditation of the Trace (that is, of the neighbor\nas a distant stranger, according to the original ambiguity of the word\ntranslated as the \u201cneighbor\u201d to be loved). A philosophy of the He who\nwould not be an impersonal object opposed to the thou, but the invis-\nible transcendence of the Other.37 If the face\u2019s expression is not revela-\ntion, then the unrevealable is expressed beyond all thematization,\nbeyond all constitutive analysis, all phenomenology. At its various\nstages, the transcendental constitution of the alter ego\u2014of which Husserl\nattempts to reassemble the description in the \ufb01fth of the Cartesian\nMeditations\u2014would presuppose that whose genesis it allegedly traces\n(according to Levinas). The Other could not be constituted as an alter\nviolence and metaphysics 131\n"

Therefore, no phenomenology\ncan account for ethics, speech, and justice.\nBut if all justice begins with speech, all speech is not just. Rhetoric\nmay amount to the violence of theory, which reduces the other when it\nleads the other, whether through psychology, demagogy, or even peda-\ngogy which is not instruction. The latter descends from the heights of\nthe master, whose absolute exteriority does not impair the disciple\u2019s\nfreedom.

An entire reading and\ninterrogation of Totality and In\ufb01nity could be developed around this\na\ufb03rmation. For this a\ufb03rmation seems to us quite implicitly\u2014perhaps\neven too implicitly\u2014to support the decisive division between what\nLevinas calls the face and that which is Beyond the Face, the section which\nconsiders, aside from the Phenomenology of Eros, Love, Fecundity, and\nwriting and difference\n132\n"

Thus, for example, De l\u2019existence \u00e0 l\u2019existant and Le temps et l\u2019autre seemed\nto proscribe the \u201clogic of genre,\u201d as well as the categories of the Same\nand Other. These lacked the originality of the experience to which\nLevinas wished to lead us back: \u201cTo the cosmos which is Plato\u2019s world\nis opposed the world of the mind, in which the implications of eros are\nnot reduced to the logic of genre, in which the ego is substituted for\nthe same, and Others for the other.\u201d Now, in Totality and In\ufb01nity, where the\ncategories of Same and Other return in force, the vis demonstrandi and\nvery energy of the break with tradition is precisely the adequation of\nEgo to the Same, and of Others to the Other. Without using these terms\nthemselves, Levinas often warned us against confusing identity and\nipseity, Same and Ego: idem and ipse. This confusion, which, in a certain\nway, is immediately practiced by the Greek concept of autos and the\nGerman concept of selbst, does not occur as spontaneously in French;\nnevertheless, it returns as a kind of silent axiom in Totality and In\ufb01nity41.\nWe have seen this: according to Levinas there would be no interior\ndi\ufb00erence, no fundamental and autochthonous alterity within the ego.\nIf, formerly, interiority, the secret and original separation, had permit-\nted the break with the classical use of the Greek concepts of Same and\nOther, the amalgamation of Same and Ego (Same and Ego homogen-\nized, and homogenized with the concept, as well as with the \ufb01nite\ntotality) now permits Levinas to include within the same condemna-\nwriting and difference\n136\n"

Simultaneously against Hegel and against Kierkegaard.\nLevinas often warns us against confusing\u2014as one is so tempted to\ndo\u2014his anti-Hegelianism with a subjectivism, or with a Kierkegaardian\ntype of existentialism, both of which would remain, according to\nLevinas, violent and premetaphysical egoisms. \u201cIt is not I who do not\naccept the system, as Kierkegaard thought, it is the other.\u201d Can one not\nwager that Kierkegaard would have been deaf to this distinction?

The\nname of a philosophical subject, when he says I, is always, in a certain\nway, a pseudonym. This is a truth that Kierkegaard adopted systematic-\nally, even while protesting against the \u201cpossibilization\u201d of individual\nexistence which resists the concept.

Within\nhistory which the philosopher cannot escape, because it is not history in\nthe sense given to it by Levinas (totality), but is the history of the\ndepartures from totality, history as the very movement of transcend-\nence, of the excess over the totality without which no totality would\nappear as such. History is not the totality transcended by eschatology,\nmetaphysics, or speech. It is transcendence itself. If speech is a move-\nment of metaphysical transcendence, it is history, and not beyond\nhistory. It is di\ufb03cult to think the origin of history in a perfectly \ufb01nite\ntotality (the Same), as well as, moreover, in a perfectly positive in\ufb01nity.\nIf, in this sense, the movement of metaphysical transcendence is his-\ntory, it is still violent, for\u2014and this is the legitimate truism from which\nLevinas always draws inspiration\u2014history is violence. Metaphysics is\neconomy: violence against violence, light against light: philosophy (in\ngeneral).

Therefore, it is not a question of recalling their\nexistence, but of asking whether Husserl \ufb01nally summarized inadequa-\ntion, and reduced the in\ufb01nite horizons of experience to the condition\nof available objects. And whether he did so by the secondary interpret-\nation of which Levinas accuses him.\nWe can hardly believe so. In the two intentional directions of which\nwe have just spoken, the Idea in the Kantian sense designates the in\ufb01nite\nover\ufb02owing of a horizon which, by reason of an absolute and essential\nnecessity which itself is absolutely principled and irreducible, never can\nbecome an object itself, or be completed, equaled, by the intuition of an\nobject.

The importance of the concept of horizon lies precisely in its\ninability to make any constitutive act into an object, and in that it opens\nthe work of objecti\ufb01cation to in\ufb01nity. In phenomenology there is never\na constitution of horizons, but horizons of constitution. That the in\ufb01n-\nity of the Husserlian horizon has the form of an inde\ufb01nite opening,\nand that it o\ufb00ers itself without any possible end to the negativity of\nconstitution (of the work of objecti\ufb01cation) does this not certainly\nkeep it from all totalization, from the illusion of the immediate pres-\nence of a plenitudinous in\ufb01nity in which the other suddenly becomes\nun\ufb01ndable? If a consciousness of in\ufb01nite inadequation to the in\ufb01nite\n(and even to the \ufb01nite) distinguishes a body of thought careful to\nrespect exteriority, it is di\ufb03cult to see how Levinas can depart from\nwriting and difference\n150\n"

But if Husserl can write this, and if, therefore, he\npresupposes access to a meaning of Being in general, how can he\ndistinguish his idealism as a theory of knowledge from metaphysical\nidealism? The latter too, posited the unreal Being of the ideal. Husserl\ndoubtless would respond, thinking of Plato, that the ideal was realized\nwithin metaphysical idealism, that is, that it was substanti\ufb01ed, hypos-\ntasized, as soon as it was not understood essentially, in each of its\naspects, as noema, and as soon as one imagined that it could be without\nin some way being thought or envisaged.

In a letter to X . . ., dated March 1638, Descartes explains that the\nproposition \u201c\u2018 I breathe, therefore I am\u2019 concludes nothing, if it has not\nbeen proven previously that one exists, or if one does not imply: I think\nthat I breathe (even if I am mistaken in this), therefore I am; and it is\nnothing other to state in this sense I breathe, therefore I am than I think,\ntherefore I am.\u201d Which means, in terms of what concerns us here, that the\nmeaning of respiration is always but a dependent and particular\ndetermination of my thought and my existence, and a fortiori of\nthought and of Being in general. Supposing that the word \u201cBeing\u201d is\nderived from a word meaning \u201crespiration\u201d (or any other determined\nthing), no etymology or philology\u2014as such, and as determined\nsciences\u2014will be able to account for the thought for which \u201crespir-\nation\u201d (or any other determined thing) becomes a determination\nof Being among others.

One must travel\nother roads\u2014or an other reading of Nietzsche\u2014in order to trace the\ngenealogy of the unheard-of meaning of Being.\nThis is a \ufb01rst reason why the \u201crelation with an existent,\u201d with some-\none (the ethical relation), cannot be \u201cdominated\u201d by \u201ca relation with\nthe Being of the existent (a relation of knowledge).\u201d\nSecond reason: the \u201crelation with the Being of the existent,\u201d which\nis in no way a relation, above all is not a \u201crelation of knowledge.\u201d65 It is\nnot a theory, as we have seen, and teaches us nothing about what is. It\nis because it is not science that Heidegger sometimes refuses it even the\nname of ontology, after having distinguished it from metaphysics, and\neven from fundamental ontology. Since it is not knowledge, the\nthought of Being is not to be confused with the concept of pure Being\nas undetermined generality.

Opposing himself to Heidegger, Levinas writes,\namong many other similar passages: \u201cIn our relation with the Other,\nthe latter does not a\ufb00ect us on the basis of a concept\u201d (Is Ontology\nFundamental?). According to Levinas, it is \ufb01nally the absolutely\nundetermined concept of Being which o\ufb00ers the Other to our under-\nstanding, that is, to our power and our violence. Now Heidegger is\nemphatic on this point: the Being which is in question is not the concept to\nwhich the existent (for example, someone) is to be submitted (sub-\nsumed). Being is not the concept of a rather indeterminate and abstract\npredicate, seeking to cover the totality of existents in its extreme uni-\nversality: (1) because it is not a predicate, and authorizes all predica-\ntion; (2) because it is \u201colder\u201d than the concrete presence of the ens; (3)\nbecause belonging to Being does not cancel any predicative di\ufb00erence,\nbut, on the contrary, permits the emergence of every possible di\ufb00er-\nence.66 Being is therefore transcategorical, and Heidegger would say of\nit what Levinas says of the other: it is \u201crefractory to the category\u201d (TI).\n\u201cThe question of Being as a question of the possibility of the concept\nof Being arises from the preconceptual comprehension of Being,\u201d67\nwrites Heidegger, opening a dialogue and a repetition, (as concerns the\nHegelian concept of pure Being as nothingness), which will not cease\nto deepen and, in the style which is almost always that of Heidegger\u2019s\ndialogue with the thinkers of tradition, will not cease to permit Hegel\u2019s\ndiscourse to grow and to speak\u2014Hegel\u2019s discourse as that of all of\nmetaphysics (Hegel included, or rather, being entirely included in\nHegel).\nThus, the thought or pre-comprehension of Being signi\ufb01es nothing\nless than a conceptual or totalitarian com-prehension. What we have\njust said of Being could also be said of the same.68 To treat Being (and\nthe same) as categories, or to treat the \u201crelationship to Being\u201d as\na relation to a category which itself could be (by \u201creversal of terms,\u201d\nTI) posed afterward, or subordinated to a determined relation (an\nethical relation, for example)\u2014is this not to forbid oneself every\ndetermination (the ethical one, for example) from the outset?

And the latter is opened only by (the at \ufb01rst preconcep-\ntual) circulation of Being. The very elocution of nonviolent metaphys-\nics is its \ufb01rst disavowal. Levinas doubtless would not deny that every\nhistorical language carries within it an irreducible conceptual moment,\nand therefore a certain violence. From his point of view, the origin and\npossibility of the concept are simply not the thought of Being, but the\ngift of the world to the other as totally-other (cf., for example, TI,\np.175). In its original possibility as o\ufb00er, in its still silent intention,\nlanguage is nonviolent (but can it be language, in this pure intention?).\nIt becomes violent only in its history, in what we have called the\nphrase, which obliges it to articulate itself in a conceptual syntax opening\nthe circulation of the same, permitting itself to be governed both by\n\u201contology\u201d and by what remains, for Levinas, the concept of concepts:\nBeing.

Because if\none does not uproot the silent origin from itself violently, if one\ndecides not to speak, then the worst violence will silently cohabit the\nidea of peace?

Since speech says nothing\nother than the horizon of this silent peace by which it has itself sum-\nmoned and that it is its mission to protect and to prepare, speech\ninde\ufb01nitely remains silent.

And whether the eschatology invoked can be\nseparated from every reference to history. For our own reference to history, here,\nis only contextual. The economy of which we are speaking does not any longer accom-\nmodate the concept of history such as it has always functioned, and which it is di\ufb03cult, if\nnot impossible, to lift from its teleological or eschatological horizon.\nThe ahistoricity of meaning at its origin is what profoundly separ-\nates Levinas from Heidegger, therefore. Since Being is history for the\nlatter, it is not outside di\ufb00erence, and thus, it originally occurs as (non-\nethical) violence, as dissimulation of itself in its own unveiling. That\nlanguage, thereby, always hides its own origin is not a contradiction,\nbut history itself. In the ontological-historical87 violence which permits\nthe thinking of ethical violence, in economy as the thought of Being,\nBeing is necessarily dissimulated. The \ufb01rst violence is this dissimula-\ntion, but it is also the \ufb01rst defeat of nihilistic violence, and the \ufb01rst\nepiphany of Being. Being, thus, is less the primum cognitum, as was said,\nthan the \ufb01rst dissimulated, and these two propositions are not contradict-\nory. For Levinas, on the contrary, Being (understood as concept) is the\n\ufb01rst dissimulating, and the ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence thereby would\nneutralize di\ufb00erence, the in\ufb01nite alterity of the totally-other. The\nontico-ontological di\ufb00erence, moreover, would be conceivable only on\nthe basis of the idea of the In\ufb01nite, of the unanticipatable irruption of\nthe totally-other existent. For Levinas, as for Heidegger, language\nwould be at once a coming forth and a holding back [r\u00e9serve],\nenlightenment and obscurity; and for both, dissimulation would be a\nconceptual gesture. But for Levinas, the concept is on the plane of\nBeing; for Heidegger it is on the plane of ontic determination.\nThis schema accentuates their opposition but, as is often the case,\nalso permits one to conjecture about their proximity: the proximity of\ntwo \u201ceschatologies\u201d which by opposed routes repeat and put into\nquestion the entire \u201cphilosophical\u201d adventure issued from Platonism.\nInterrogate it simultaneously from within and without, in the form of\na question to Hegel, in whom this adventure is thought and recapitu-\nlated.

For\nMalebranche, in\ufb01nity is its very form: \u201cThe idea of the extended in\ufb01n-\nite thus encloses more reality than that of the heavens; and the idea of\nthe in\ufb01nite in all genres of Being, that which corresponds to this word,\nBeing, the in\ufb01nitely perfect being, contains in\ufb01nitely more [reality),\nalthough the perception with which this idea a\ufb00ects us is the slightest\nof all; and is slighter to the extent that it is more vast, and consequently\nin\ufb01nitely slight because in\ufb01nite\u201d (Entretien d\u2019un philosophe chr\u00e9tien avec un\nphilosophe chinois.)

For example:\nThe Idiot: See how easie the dif\ufb01cultie is in divine things, that it always\noffers it self to the seeker, in the same manner that it is sought for.

The \ufb01rst phase of\nphenomenology, in its style and its objects, is structuralist, because\n\ufb01rst and foremost it seeks to stay clear of psychologism and histori-\ncism. But it is not genetic description in general which is disquali\ufb01ed,\nbut only the genetic description which borrows its schemas from\nnaturalism and causalism, and depends upon a science of \u201cfacts\u201d and\ntherefore on an empiricism; and therefore, concludes Husserl, depends\nupon a relativism incapable of insuring its own truth; therefore, on a\nskepticism. The transition to the phenomenological attitude is made\nnecessary, thus, by the impotence or philosophical fragility of\ngenetism when the latter, by means of a positivism which does not\nunderstand itself, believes itself capable of enclosure by a \u201cscience-of-\nfacts\u201d (Tatsachenwissenschaft), whether this be a natural science or a sci-\nence of the mind. The expression \u201cworldly genesis\u201d covers the domain\nof these sciences.\nFor as long as the phenomenological space has not been uncovered,\nand for as long as the transcendental description has not been under-\ntaken, the problem of \u201cstructure and genesis\u201d seems to have no mean-\ning. Neither the idea of structure, which isolates the di\ufb00erent spheres\nof objective signi\ufb01cation with respect for their static originality, nor\nthe idea of genesis, which e\ufb00ects abusive transitions from one region\nto another, appears adequate to clarify the problem which is already\nHusserl\u2019s, that is, the problem of the foundation of objectivity.\nThis might appear to be inconsequential: can one not imagine, in\ne\ufb00ect, a methodological fecundity of these two notions in the various\ndomains of the natural and social sciences to the extent that the latter,\nin their own movement and moment, in their actual labor, do not have\ngenesis and structure 199\n"

It is the strange presence of\nthis Idea which also permits every transition to the limit and the pro-\nduction of all exactitude.\n2. Transcendental intentionality is described in Ideas I as an original\nstructure, an archi-structure (Ur-Struktur) with four poles and two cor-\nrelations: the noetico-noematic correlation or structure and the morphe-\nhyle correlation or structure. That this complex structure is the structure\nboth of intentionality, that is, the structure of the origin of meanings\nand of the opening to the light of phenomenality, and that the occlu-\nsion of this structure is non-sense itself, is indicated by at least two\nsigns: (A) Noesis and noema, the intentional moments of the structure,\ncan be distinguished in that the noema does not belong to conscious-\nness in a real way.

In any event, the transcendentality of the opening is\nsimultaneously the origin and the undoing, the condition of possibility\nand a certain impossibility of every structure and of every systematic\nstructuralism. (B) While the noema is an intentional and non-real\nelement, the hyle\u00af is a real but not intentional element of the experi-\nenced. It is the sensate (experienced and not real) material of a\ufb00ect\nbefore any animation by intentional form. It is the pole of pure passiv-\nity, of the nonintentionality without which consciousness could not\nreceive anything other than itself, nor exercise its intentional activity.\nThis receptiveness is also an essential opening.

It was all\nthe more tempting to think so in that Husserl himself prescribed the\nestablishment of a phenomenological psychology, an \u201capriorical\u201d\npsychology, to be sure, but also a worldly one (in that it cannot exclude\nthe position of the worldly thing that the psyche is), and strictly parallel to\ntranscendental phenomenology.

(B) The\negological route. In a sense this route is already latent beneath the pre-\nceding one. First, because in the most general fashion, phenomen-\nology cannot and may not ever describe anything but the intentional\nmodi\ufb01cations of the eidos ego in general.20 Next, because the genealogy\nof logic kept to the realm of cogitata and the acts of the ego as if to its\nproper existence and life; and these were read only on the basis of\nnoematic signs and results. Now however, as stated in the Cartesian\nMeditations, it is a question of returning once more to the couple cogito-\ncogitatum, if you will, in order to reapprehend the genesis of the ego\nitself, the ego existing for itself and \u201ccontinuously constituting [itself]\nas existing.\u201d21 Aside from the delicate problems of passivity and activity,\nthis genetic description of the ego will encounter limits which we\nwould be tempted to call de\ufb01nitive, but which Husserl, of course,\nconsiders provisional. They derive from the fact, he says, that phe-\nnomenology is only at its beginnings.22 In e\ufb00ect the genetic descrip-\ntion of the ego at every instant prescribes the formidable task of a\nuniversal genetic phenomenology.

The eidetics of history\ncannot be an eidetics among others: it embraces the totality of beings.\nIn e\ufb00ect the irruption of the logos, the accession to human conscious-\nness of the idea of an in\ufb01nite task of reason, does not occur only\nthrough a series of revolutions which at the same time would be\ngenesis and structure 207\n"

For the theater of cruelty is not a new theater destined to\nescort some new novel that would modify from within an unshaken\ntradition.

Whatever may be thought of the continuities and\nruptures to come, this hypothesis is remarkable as soon as it is con-\nsidered as a metaphorical model and not as a neurological description.\nBreaching, the tracing of a trail, opens up a conducting path. Which\npresupposes a certain violence and a certain resistance to e\ufb00raction.\nThe path is broken, cracked, fracta, breached. Now there would be two\nkinds of neurones: the permeable neurones (\u0001), which o\ufb00er no resist-\nance and thus retain no trace of impression, would be the perceptual\nneurones; other neurones (\u03c8), which would oppose contact-barriers\nto the quantity of excitation, would thus retain the printed trace: they\n\u201cthus a\ufb00ord a possibility of representing (darzustellen) memory\u201d (ibid.).\nThis is the \ufb01rst representation, the \ufb01rst staging of memory. (Darstellung is\nrepresentation in the weak sense of the word, but also frequently in the\nsense of visual depiction, and sometimes of theatrical performance.\nOur translation will vary with the in\ufb02ection of the context.) Freud\nattributes psychical quality only to these latter neurones. They are the\n\u201cvehicles of memory and so probably of psychical processes in gen-\neral\u201d (I, 300). Memory, thus, is not a psychical property among others;\nit is the very essence of the psyche: resistance, and precisely, thereby,\nan opening to the e\ufb00raction of the trace.\nNow assuming that Freud here intends to speak only the language of\nfull and present quantity, assuming, as at least appears to be the case,\nthat he intends to situate his work within the simple opposition of\nquantity and quality (the latter being reserved for the pure transpar-\nency of a perception without memory), we \ufb01nd that the concept of\nbreaching shows itself intolerant of this intention. An equality of\nresistance to breaching, or an equivalence of the breaching forces,\nwould eliminate any preference in the choice of itinerary. Memory would\nbe paralyzed. It is the di\ufb00erence between breaches which is the true\norigin of memory, and thus of the psyche. Only this di\ufb00erence enables\na \u201cpathway to be preferred (Wegbevorzugung)\u201d: \u201cMemory is represented\n(dargestellt) by the di\ufb00erences in the facilitations of the \u03c8,-neurones\u201d (1,\n300).

Repetition adds no quantity of present force, no intensity; it repro-\nduces the same impression\u2014yet it has the power of breaching. \u201cThe\nmemory of an experience (that is, its continuing operative power)\ndepends on a factor which is called the magnitude of the impression\nand on the frequency with which the same impression is repeated\u201d (I,\n300). The number of repetitions is thus added to the quantity (Q\u03b7) of\nthe excitation, and these two quantities are of two absolutely hetero-\ngeneous types. There are only discrete repetitions, and they can act as\nsuch only through the diastem which maintains their separation.\nFinally, if breaching can supplement a quantity presently at work, or\ncan be added to it, it is because breaching is certainly analogous to\nquantity, but is other than it as well: \u201cquantity plus facilitation resul-\nting from Q\u03b7 are at the same time something that can replace Q\u03b7\u201d (I,\n300\u2013301). Let us not hasten to de\ufb01ne this other of pure quantity\nas quality: for in so doing we would be transforming the force\nof memory into present consciousness and the translucid perception of\npresent qualities. Thus, neither the di\ufb00erence between full quantities,\nnor the interval between repetitions of the identical, nor breaching\nitself, may be thought of in terms of the opposition between quantity\nand quality.4 Memory cannot be derived from this opposition, and it\nescapes the grasp of \u201cnaturalism\u201d as well as of \u201cphenomenology.\u201d\nAll these di\ufb00erences in the production of the trace may be reinter-\npreted as moments of deferring. In accordance with a motif which will\ncontinue to dominate Freud\u2019s thinking, this movement is described as\nthe e\ufb00ort of life to protect itself by deferring a dangerous cathexis, that is,\nby constituting a reserve (Vorrat). The threatening expenditure or pres-\nence are deferred with the help of breaching or repetition. Is this not\nalready the detour (Aufschub, lit. delay) which institutes the relation of\npleasure to reality (Beyond . . . ., SE, XVIII)?

Life must be\nthought of as trace before Being may be determined as presence. This is\nthe only condition on which we can say that life is death, that repetition\nand the beyond of the pleasure principle are native and congenital to\nthat which they transgress. When Freud writes in the Project that \u201cfacili-\ntations serve the primary function,\u201d he is forbidding us to be surprised\nby Beyond the Pleasure Principle. He complies with a dual necessity: that of\nrecognizing di\ufb00\u00e9rance at the origin, and at the same time that of crossing\nout the concept of primariness: we will not, then, be surprised by the\nTraumdeutung, which de\ufb01nes primariness as a \u201ctheoretical \ufb01ction\u201d in a\nparagraph on the \u201cdelaying\u201d (Versp\u00e4tung) of the secondary process. It is\nthus the delay which is in the beginning.5 Without which, di\ufb00\u00e9rance\nwould be the lapse which a consciousness, a self-presence of the pres-\nent, accords itself. To defer (di\ufb00\u00e9rer) thus cannot mean to retard a present\npossibility, to postpone an act, to put o\ufb00 a perception already now\npossible. That possibility is possible only through a di\ufb00\u00e9rance which\nmust be conceived of in other terms than those of a calculus or mech-\nanics of decision.6 To say that di\ufb00\u00e9rance is originary is simultaneously to\nerase the myth of a present origin. Which is why \u201coriginary\u201d must be\nunderstood as having been crossed out, without which di\ufb00\u00e9rance would be\nderived from an original plenitude. It is a non-origin which is\noriginary.\nRather than abandon it, we ought perhaps then to rethink the con-\ncept of di\ufb00\u00e9rer. This is what we should like to do, and this is possible only\nif di\ufb00\u00e9rance is determined outside any teleological or eschatological\nhorizon. Which is not easy. Let us note in passing that the concepts\nof Nachtr\u00e4glichkeit and V\u00e9rspatung, concepts which govern the whole of\nFreud\u2019s thought and determine all his other concepts, are already pres-\nent and named in the Project. The irreducibility of the \u201ce\ufb00ect of\ndeferral\u201d\u2014 such, no doubt, is Freud\u2019s discovery. Freud exploits this\ndiscovery in its ultimate consequences, beyond the psychoanalysis of\nthe individual, and he thought that the history of culture ought to\ncon\ufb01rm it. In Moses and Monotheism (1937), the e\ufb03cacy of delay and of\naction subsequent to the event is at work over large historical intervals.\nfreud and the scene of writing 255\n"

Before the analysis of the Irma dream, Freud engages in\nconsiderations of method. In one of his familiar gestures, he opposes\nthe old popular tradition to so-called scienti\ufb01c psychology. As always,\nit is in order to justify the profound intention which inspires the\nformer. Popular tradition may err, of course, when according to a\n\u201csymbolical\u201d procedure, it treats dream content as an indivisible and\nunarticulated whole, for which a second, possibly prophetic whole\nmay be substituted. But Freud is not far from accepting the \u201cother\npopular method\u201d: \u201cIt might be described as the \u2018decoding\u2019 method\n(Chi\ufb00riermethode), since it treats dreams as a kind of cryptography\n(Geheimschrift) in which each sign can be translated into another sign\nhaving a known meaning, in accordance with a \ufb01xed key (Schl\u00fcssel)\u201d (IV,\n97). Let us retain the allusion to a permanent code: it is the weakness of\na method to which Freud attributes, nevertheless, the merit of being\nanalytic and of spelling out the elements of meaning one by one.\nA strange example, the one chosen by Freud to illustrate this trad-\nitional procedure: a text of phonetic writing is cathected and functions\nas a discrete, speci\ufb01c, translatable and unprivileged element in the\noverall writing of the dream. Phonetic writing as writing within writ-\ning. Assume, for example, says Freud, that I have dreamed of a letter\n(Brief / epistola), then of a burial. Open a Traumbuch, a book in which the\nkeys to dreams are recorded, an encyclopedia of dream signs, the\ndream dictionary which Freud will soon reject. It teaches us that letter\nmust be translated (\u00fcbersetzen) by spite, and burial by engagement to be\nmarried. Thus a letter (epistola) written with letters (litterae), a document\ncomposed of phonetic signs, the transcription of verbal discourse, may\nbe translated by a nonverbal signi\ufb01er which, inasmuch as it is a deter-\nmined a\ufb00ect, belongs to the overall syntax of dream writing. The verbal\nis cathected, and its phonetic transcription is bound, far from the cen-\nter, in a web of silent script.\nFreud then borrows another example from Artemidorous of Daldis\n(second century), the author of a treatise on the interpretation of\ndreams. Let it be a pretext for recalling that in the eighteenth century an\nEnglish theologian, known to Freud, had already invoked Artemidorus\nwith an intention that is doubtless worthy of comparison.9 Warburton\nwriting and difference\n260\n"

That science is Traumdeutung, also\nknown as oneirocriticism. When all is said and done, it was only a\nscience of writing in priestly hands. God, the Egyptians believed, had\nmade man a gift of writing just as he inspired dreams. Interpreters, like\ndreams themselves, then had only to draw upon the curiological or\ntropological storehouse.

And, in fact, Freud never stopped proposing codes, rules of\ngreat generality. And the substitution of signi\ufb01ers seems to be the\nessential activity of psychoanalytic interpretation. Certainly, Freud\nnevertheless stipulates an essential limitation on this activity. Or, rather,\na double limitation.\nIf we consider \ufb01rst verbal expression, as it is circumscribed in the\ndream, we observe that its sonority, the materiality of the expression,\ndoes not disappear before the signi\ufb01ed, or at least cannot be traversed\nand transgressed as it is in conscious speech. It acts as such, with the\ne\ufb03cacy Artaud assigned it on the stage of cruelty.12The materiality of a\nword cannot be translated or carried over into another language.\nMateriality is precisely that which translation relinquishes. To relin-\nquish materiality: such is the driving force of translation. And when\nthat materiality is reinstated, translation becomes poetry. In this sense,\nsince the materiality of the signi\ufb01er constitutes the idiom of every\ndream scene, dreams are untranslatable: \u201cIndeed, dreams are so closely\nrelated to linguistic expression that Ferenczi has truly remarked that\nevery tongue has its own dream language. It is impossible as a rule to\ntranslate a dream into a foreign language, and this is equally true, I\nfancy, of a book such as the present one\u201d (IV, 99, n. 1). What is valid\nfor a speci\ufb01c national language is a fortiori valid for a private grammar.\nMoreover, this horizontal impossibility of translation without loss\nhas its basis in a vertical impossibility. We are speaking here of the way\nin which unconscious thoughts become conscious. If a dream cannot\nbe translated into another language, it is because within the psychical\napparatus as well there is never a relation of simple translation. We are\nwrong, Freud tells us, to speak of translation or transcription in\ndescribing the transition of unconscious thoughts through the pre-\nconscious toward consciousness.

It is thus not enough to speak of writing in\norder to be faithful to Freud, for it is then that we may betray him more\nthan ever.\nThis is what the last chapter of the Traumdeutung explains. An entirely\nand conventionally topographical metaphor of the psychical apparatus\nis to be completed by invoking the existence of force and of two kinds\nof processes of excitation or modes of its discharge: \u201cSo let us try to\ncorrect some conceptions [intuitive illustrations: Anschauungen] which\nmight be misleading so long as we looked upon the two systems in the\nmost literal and crudest sense as two localities in the mental\napparatus\u2014conceptions which left their traces in the expressions \u2018to\nrepress\u2019 and \u2018to force a way through.\u2019 Thus, we may speak of an\nunconscious thought seeking to convey itself into the preconscious so\nas to be able then to force its way through into consciousness.

Erases it while producing it: the\nmedium of the dialogue and misunderstanding between the Husserlian\nand Heideggerian concepts of Being-in- the-world.)\nConcerning this nontranscriptive writing, Freud adds a fundamental\nspeci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation will reveal: (1) the danger involved in\nimmobilizing or freezing energy within a naive metaphorics of place;\n(2) the necessity not of abandoning but of rethinking the space or\ntopology of this writing; (3) that Freud, who still insists on representing\nthe psychical apparatus in an arti\ufb01cial model, has not yet discovered a\nmechanical model adequate to the graphematic conceptual scheme he\nis already using to describe the psychical text.\nAgain, we may speak of a preconscious thought being repressed or\ndriven out and then taken over by the unconscious. These images,\nderived from a set of ideas (Vorstellungskreis) relating to a struggle for a\npiece of ground, may tempt us to suppose that it is literally true that a\nmental grouping (Anordnung) in one locality has been brought to an\nend and replaced by a fresh one in another locality.

Freud emphasizes this: psychic\nwriting does not lend itself to translation because it is a single energetic\nsystem (however di\ufb00erentiated it may be), and because it covers the\nentirety of the psychical apparatus. Despite the di\ufb00erence of agencies,\npsychical writing in general is not a displacement of meanings within\nthe limpidity of an immobile, pregiven space and the blank neutrality\nof discourse. A discourse which might be coded without ceasing to be\ndiaphanous. Here energy cannot be reduced; it does not limit meaning,\nbut rather produces it. The distinction between force and meaning is\nderivative in relation to an archi-trace; it belongs to the metaphysics of\nconsciousness and of presence, or rather of presence in the word, in the\nhallucination of a language determined on the basis of the word or of\nverbal representation. The metaphysics of preconsciousness, Freud\nmight say, since the preconscious is the place he assigns to the verbal.\nWithout that, would Freud have taught us anything new?\nForce produces meaning (and space) through the power of \u201crepeti-\ntion\u201d alone, which inhabits it originarily as its death. This power, that is,\nthis lack of power, which opens and limits the labor of force, institutes\ntranslatability, makes possible what we call \u201clanguage,\u201d transforms an\nabsolute idiom into a limit which is always already transgressed: a pure\nidiom is not language; it becomes so only through repetition; repetition\nalways already divides the point of departure of the \ufb01rst time. Despite\nappearances, this does not contradict what we said earlier about\nuntranslatability. At that time it was a question of recalling the origin of\nthe movement of transgression, the origin of repetition, and the becom-\ning-language of the idiom. If one limits oneself to the datum or the e\ufb00ect of\nrepetition, to translation, to the obviousness of the distinction between\nforce and meaning, not only does one miss the originality of Freud\u2019s\naim, but one e\ufb00aces the intensity of the relation to death as well.\nWe ought thus to examine closely\u2014which we cannot do here\u2014all\nthat Freud invites to think concerning writing as \u201cbreaching\u201d in the\npsychical repetition of this previously neurological notion: opening up of its\nown space, e\ufb00raction, breaking of a path against resistances, rupture\nand irruption becoming a route (rupta, via rupta), violent inscription of a\nform, tracing of a di\ufb00erence in a nature or a matter which are conceiv-\nable as such only in their opposition to writing. The route is opened in\nnature or matter, forest or wood (hyle), and in it acquires a reversibility\nwriting and difference\n268\n"

We should have to study together, genetically and\nstructurally, the history of the road and the history of writing.16 We are\nthinking here of Freud\u2019s texts on the work of the memory-trace (Erin-\nnerungsspur) which, though no longer the neurological trace, is not yet\n\u201cconscious memory,\u201d (\u201cThe Unconscious,\u201d SE XIV, 188), and of the\nitinerant work of the trace, producing and following its route, the trace\nwhich traces, the trace which breaks open its own path. The metaphor\nof pathbreaking, so frequently used in Freud\u2019s descriptions, is always in\ncommunication with the theme of the supplementary delay and with the\nreconstitution of meaning through deferral, after a mole-like progres-\nsion, after the subterranean toil of an impression. This impression has\nleft behind a laborious trace which has never been perceived, whose\nmeaning has never been lived in the present, i.e., has never been lived\nconsciously. The postscript which constitutes the past present as such is\nnot satis\ufb01ed, as Plato, Hegel, and Proust perhaps thought, with\nreawakening or revealing the present past in its truth. It produces the\npresent past. Is sexual deferral the best example or the essence of this\nmovement? A false question, no doubt: the (presumably known) subject\nof the question\u2014sexuality\u2014is determined, limited, or unlimited only\nthrough inversion and through the answer itself. Freud\u2019s answer, in any\nevent, is decisive. Take the Wolf-Man. It is by deferral that the percep-\ntion of the primal scene\u2014whether it be reality or fantasy hardly\nmatters\u2014is lived in its meaning, and sexual maturation is not the\naccidental form of this delay. \u201cAt age one and a half, he received\nimpressions the deferred understanding of which became possible for\nhim at the time of the dream through his development, exaltation and\nsexual investigations.\u201d Already in the Project, concerning repression in\nhysteria: \u201cWe invariably \ufb01nd that a memory is repressed which has\nbecome a trauma only after the event (nur nachtr\u00e4glich). The reason for\nthis state of things is the retardation (Versp\u00e4tung) of puberty as compared\nwith the remainder of the individual\u2019s development.\u201d That should\nlead, if not to the solution, at least to a new way of posing the formid-\nable problem of the temporalization and the so-called \u201ctimelessness\u201d\nof the unconscious. Here, more than elsewhere, the gap between\nFreud\u2019s intuition and his concepts is apparent. The timelessness of the\nunconscious is no doubt determined only in opposition to a common\nconcept of time, a traditional concept, the metaphysical concept: the\nfreud and the scene of writing 269\n"

Everything that can be an object (Gegenstand) of our internal\nperception is virtual, like the image produced in a telescope by the\npassage of light rays. But we are justi\ufb01ed in assuming the existence of\nthe systems (which are not in any way psychical entities themselves [my italics]\nand can never be accessible to our psychical perception) like the lenses\nof the telescope, which cast the image.

Summarizing all these possibilities, Freud concludes: \u201cYet, in\nspite of all this ambiguity, it is fair to say that the productions (mises en\nsc\u00e8ne) of the dream-work, which, it must be remembered, are not made\nwith the intention of being understood, present no greater di\ufb03culties to their\ntranslators than do the ancient hieroglyphic scripts to those who seek\nto read them\u201d (V, 341).\nMore than twenty years separate the \ufb01rst edition of the Traumdeutung\nfrom the \u201cNote on the Mystic Writing-Pad.\u201d If we continue to follow\nthe two series of metaphors\u2014those concerning the nonpsychical sys-\ntem of the psychical and those concerning the psychical itself\u2014what\nhappens?\nOn the one hand, the theoretical import of the psychographic metaphor will\nbe increasingly re\ufb01ned.

In fact, the interpretation of a dream is\ncompletely analogous to the decipherment of an ancient pictographic\nscript such as Egyptian hieroglyphics.

The debate between the functional hypothesis and the\ntopographical hypothesis concerns the locations of an inscription (Nieder-\nschrift): \u201cWhen a psychical act (let us con\ufb01ne ourselves here to one\nwhich is in the nature of an idea [Vorstellung, lit. representation] is trans-\nposed from the systems Ucs. into the system Cs.

If one wishes to destroy what has been written, all that is neces-\nsary is to raise the double covering-sheet from the wax slab by a light\npull, starting from the free lower end.28 The close contact between the\nwaxed paper and the wax slab at the places which have been scratched\n(upon which the visibility of the writing depended) is thus brought to\nan end and it does not recur when the two surfaces come together\nonce more. The Mystic Pad is now clear of writing and ready to receive\nfresh inscriptions [XIX, 228\u201329].\nLet us note that the depth of the Mystic Pad is simultaneously a depth\nwithout bottom, an in\ufb01nite allusion, and a perfectly super\ufb01cial exter-\niority: a strati\ufb01cation of surfaces each of whose relation to itself, each\nof whose interior, is but the implication of another similarly exposed\nsurface. It joins the two empirical certainties by which we are consti-\ntuted: in\ufb01nite depth in the implication of meaning, in the unlimited\nenvelopment of the present, and, simultaneously, the pellicular essence\nof being, the absolute absence of any foundation.\nNeglecting the device\u2019s \u201cslight imperfections,\u201d interested only in\nthe analogy, Freud insists on the essentially protective nature of the\ncelluloid sheet. Without it, the \ufb01ne waxed paper would be scratched\nor ripped. There is no writing which does not devise some means\nof protection, to protect against itself, against the writing by which the\nfreud and the scene of writing 281\n"

There is as yet no\nwriting in the \ufb02atness of this extensia. We must account for writing as a\ntrace which survives the scratch\u2019s present, punctuality, and stigme\u00af. \u201cThis\nanalogy,\u201d Freud continues, \u201cwould not be of much value if it could not\nbe pursued further than this.\u201d This is the second analogy: \u201cIf we lift the\nentire covering-sheet\u2014both the celluloid and the waxed paper\u2014o\ufb00\nthe wax slab, the writing vanishes, and, as I have already remarked,\ndoes not re-appear again.

The\ncontradictory requirements are satis\ufb01ed by this double system, and\n\u201cthis is precisely the way in which, according to the hypothesis which I\nmentioned just now, our psychical apparatus performs its perceptual\nfunction. The layer which receives the stimuli\u2014the system Pcpt.-Cs.\u2014\nforms no permanent traces; the foundations of memory come about in\nother, supplementary, systems\u201d (ibid.).

But it is\nbound to life and to the living present which it repeats originarily. A\npure representation, a machine, never runs by itself. Such at least is the\nlimitation which Freud recognizes in his analogy with the Mystic\nPad. Like the \ufb01rst section of the \u201cNote,\u201d his gesture at this point is\nextremely Platonic. Only the writing of the soul, said the Phaedrus, only\nthe psychical trace is able to reproduce and to represent itself spon-\ntaneously. Our reading had skipped over the following remark by\nFreud: \u201cThere must come a point at which the analogy between an\nauxiliary apparatus of this kind and the organ which is its prototype\nwill cease to apply. It is true, too, that once the writing has been erased,\nthe Mystic Pad cannot \u2018reproduce\u2019 it from within; it would be a mystic\npad indeed if, like our memory, it could accomplish that\u201d (XIX, 230).\nAbandoned to itself, the multiplicity of layered surfaces of the appar-\natus is a dead complexity without depth. Life as depth belongs only to\nthe wax of psychical memory. Freud, like Plato, thus continues to\noppose hypomnemic writing and writing en tei psychei, itself woven of\ntraces, empirical memories of a present truth outside of time. Hence-\nforth, the Mystic Pad, separated from psychical responsibility, a repre-\nsentation abandoned to itself, still participates in Cartesian space and\nmechanics: natural wax, exteriority of the memory aid.\nAll that Freud had thought about the unity of life and death, how-\never, should have led him to ask other questions here. And to ask them\nexplicitly. Freud does not explicitly examine the status of the \u201cmaterial-\nized\u201d supplement which is necessary to the alleged spontaneity of\nmemory, even if that spontaneity were di\ufb00erentiated in itself, thwarted\nby a censorhsip or repression which, moreover, could not act on a\nperfectly spontaneous memory. Far from the machine being a pure\nabsence of spontaneity, its resemblance to the psychical apparatus, its\nexistence and its necessity bear witness to the \ufb01nitude of the mnemic\nspontaneity which is thus supplemented. The machine\u2014and, con-\nsequently, representation\u2014is death and \ufb01nitude within the psyche. Nor\ndoes Freud examine the possibility of this machine, which, in the\nworld, has at least begun to resemble memory, and increasingly\nresembles it more closely. Its resemblance to memory is closer than\nthat of the innocent Mystic Pad: the latter is no doubt in\ufb01nitely more\nwriting and difference\n286\n"

An unerasable trace is not a\ntrace, it is a full presence, an immobile and uncorruptible substance, a\nson of God, a sign of parousia and not a seed, that is, a mortal germ.\nThis erasure is death itself, and it is within its horizon that we must\nconceive not only the \u201cpresent,\u201d but also what Freud doubtless believed\nto be the indelibility of certain traces in the unconscious, where \u201cnoth-\ning ends, nothing happens, nothing is forgotten.\u201c This erasure of the\ntrace is not only an accident that can occur here or there, nor is it even\nthe necessary structure of a determined censorship threatening a given\npresence; it is the very structure which makes possible, as the move-\nment of temporalization and pure auto-a\ufb00ection, something that can\nbe called repression in general, the original synthesis of original\nrepression and secondary repression, repression \u201citself.\u201d\nSuch a radicalization of the thought of the trace (a thought because it\nescapes binarism and makes binarism possible on the basis of nothing),\nwould be fruitful not only in the deconstruction of logocentrism, but\nin a kind of re\ufb02ection exercised more positively in di\ufb00erent \ufb01elds, at\ndi\ufb00erent levels of writing in general, at the point of articulation of\nwriting in the current sense and of the trace in general.\nThese \ufb01elds, whose speci\ufb01city thereby could be opened to a thought\nfecundated by psychoanalysis, would be numerous.

Now a necessary a\ufb03rmation can be born only by\nbeing reborn to itself. For Artaud, the future of the theater\u2014thus, the\nfuture in general\u2014is opened only by the anaphora which dates from\nthe eve prior to birth. Theatricality must traverse and restore \u201cexist-\nence\u201d and \u201c\ufb02esh\u201d in each of their aspects. Thus, whatever can be said\nof the body can be said of the theater. As we know, Artaud lived the\nmorrow of a dispossession: his proper body, the property and propri-\nety of his body, had been stolen from him at birth by the thieving god\nwho was born in order \u201cto pass himself o\ufb00 / as me.\u201d1 Rebirth doubtless\noccurs through\u2014Artaud recalls this often\u2014a kind of reeducation of\nthe organs. But this reeducation permits the access to a life before birth\nand after death (\u201c. . .through dying / I have \ufb01nally achieved real\nimmortality,\u201d p. 110), and not to a death before birth and after life.\nThis is what distinguishes the a\ufb03rmation of cruelty from romantic\nnegativity; the di\ufb00erence is slight and yet decisive. Lichtenberger: \u201cI\ncannot rid myself of this idea that I was dead before I was born, and that\nthrough death I will return to this very state. . . . To die and to be\nreborn with the memory of one\u2019s former existence is called fainting; to\nawaken with other organs which must \ufb01rst be reeducated is called\nbirth.\u201d For Artaud, the primary concern is not to die in dying, not to let\nthe thieving god divest him of his life. \u201cAnd I believe that there is\nalways someone else, at the extreme moment of death, to strip us of\nour own lives\u201d (AA, p. 162).\nSimilarly, Western theater has been separated from the force of its\nessence, removed from its a\ufb03rmative essence, its vis a\ufb03rmativa. And this\ndispossession occurred from the origin on, is the very movement of\norigin, of birth as death.\nThis is why a \u201cplace\u201d is \u201cleft on all the stages of stillborn theater\u201d\n(\u201cLe th\u00e9\u00e2 tre et l\u2019anatomie,\u201d in La rue, July 1946). The theater is born in\nits own disappearance, and the o\ufb00spring of this movement has a name:\nman. The theater of cruelty is to be born by separating death from birth\nand by erasing the name of man. The theater has always been made to\nthe theater of cruelty 293\n"

And it is into this opening that we wish\nto enter here.\nIf throughout the world today\u2014and so many examples bear witness\nto this in the most striking fashion\u2014all theatrical audacity declares its\n\ufb01delity to Artaud (correctly or incorrectly, but with increasing insist-\nency), then the question of the theater of cruelty, of its present inexist-\nence and its implacable necessity, has the value of a historic question. A\nhistoric question not because it could be inscribed within what is\ncalled the history of theater, not because it would be epoch-making\nwithin the becoming of theatrical forms, or because it would occupy a\nposition within the succession of models of theatrical representation.\nThis question is historic in an absolute and radical sense. It announces\nthe limit of representation.\nThe theater of cruelty is not a representation. It is life itself, in the extent\nto which life is unrepresentable. Life is the nonrepresentable origin of\nrepresentation. \u201cI have therefore said \u2018cruelty\u2019 as I might have said \u2018life\u2019\u201d\n(TD, p. 114). This life carries man along with it, but is not primarily the\nlife of man. The latter is only a representation of life, and such is the\nwriting and difference\n294\n"

Now, for Artaud, the festival\nof cruelty could take place only one time: \u201cLet us leave textual criti-\ncism to graduate students, formal criticism to esthetes, and recognize\nthat what has been said is not still to be said; that an expression does\nnot have the same value twice, does not live two lives; that all words,\nonce spoken, are dead and function only at the moment when they\nare uttered, that a form, once it has served, cannot be used again and\nasks only to be replaced by another, and that the theater is the only\nplace in the world where a gesture, once made, can never be made\nthe same way twice\u201d (TD, p. 75). This is indeed how things appear:\ntheatrical representation is \ufb01nite, and leaves behind it, behind its\nactual presence, no trace, no object to carry o\ufb00.

Plato criticizes writing as a body; Artaud criticizes it\nas the erasure of the body, of the living gesture which takes place only\nonce. Writing is space itself and the possibility of repetition in general.\nThis is why \u201cWe should get rid of our superstitious valuation of texts\nand written poetry.

Such is the condition of meaning, of\nhistory of discourse, of philosophy, etc. The master is in relation to\nhimself, and self-consciousness is constituted, only through the medi-\nation of servile consciousness in the movement of recognition; but\nsimultaneously through the mediation of the thing, which for the\nslave is initially the essentiality that he cannot immediately negate in\npleasurable consumption, but can only work upon, \u201celaborate\u201d (bearbe-\niten); which consists in inhibiting (hemmen) his desire, in delaying\n(aufhalten) the disappearance of the thing.

This life is not natural life, the\nbiological existence put at stake in lordship, but an essential life that is\nwelded to the \ufb01rst one, holding it back, making it work for the consti-\ntution of self-consciousness, truth, and meaning. Such is the truth of\nlife. Through this recourse to the Aufhebung, which conserves the stakes,\nremains in control of the play, limiting it and elaborating it by giving it\nform and meaning (Die Arbeit . . . bildet), this economy of life restricts\nitself to conservation, to circulation and self-reproduction as the repro-\nduction of meaning; henceforth, everything covered by the name lord-\nship collapses into comedy.

In Wales, the cof\ufb01n\nwas placed open and upright in the place of honor of the house. The\ndead person was dressed in his Sunday best and his top hat.

Pushing itself toward the nonbasis\nof negativity and of expenditure, the experience of the continuum is also\nthe experience of absolute di\ufb00erence, of a di\ufb00erence which would no\nlonger be the one that Hegel had conceived more profoundly than\nanyone else: the di\ufb00erence in the service of presence, at work for (the)\nhistory (of meaning). The di\ufb00erence between Hegel and Bataille is the\ndi\ufb00erence between these two di\ufb00erences. This enables one to dispel the\nequivocality which might weigh upon the concepts of communication,\ncontinuum, or instant. These concepts, which seem to be identical to each other\nlike the accomplishing of presence, in fact mark and sharpen the inci-\nsion of di\ufb00erence. \u201cA fundamental principle is expressed as follows:\n\u2018communication\u2019 cannot take place from one full and intact being to\nanother: it requires beings who have put the being within themselves at\nstake, have placed it at the limit of death, of nothingness\u201d (Sur Nietzsche).\nAnd the instant\u2014the temporal mode of the sovereign operation\u2014is not\na point of full and unpenetrated presence: it slides and eludes us between\ntwo presences; it is di\ufb00erence as the a\ufb03rmative elusion of presence. It\ndoes not give itself but is stolen, carries itself o\ufb00 in a movement which is\nsimultaneously one of violent e\ufb00raction and of vanishing \ufb02ight.

(\u201cI introduce unten-\nable concepts,\u201d Le petit). The philosopher is blind to Bataille\u2019s text\nbecause he is a philosopher only through the desire to hold on to, to\nmaintain his certainty of himself and the security of the concept as\nsecurity against this sliding. For him, Bataille\u2019s text is full of traps: it is,\nin the initial sense of the word, a scandal.\nThe transgression of meaning is not an access to the immediate and\nindeterminate identity of a nonmeaning, nor is it an access to the possi-\nbility of maintaining nonmeaning. Rather, we would have to speak of\nan epoche\u00af of the epoch of meaning, of a\u2014written\u2014putting between\nbrackets that suspends the epoch of meaning: the opposite of a phe-\nnomenological epoche\u00af, for this latter is carried out in the name and in sight of\nmeaning. The phenomenological epoche\u00af is a reduction that pushes us\nback toward meaning. Sovereign transgression is a reduction of this\nreduction: not a reduction to meaning, but a reduction of meaning.\nThus, while exceeding the Phenomenology of the Mind, this transgression at\nthe same time exceeds phenomenology in general, in its most modern\ndevelopments (cf. EI, p. 19).\nWill this new writing depend upon the agency of sovereignty? Will it\nobey the imperatives of sovereignty? Will it subordinate itself to that\nwhich subordinates nothing? (And does so, one might say, by essence,\nif sovereignty had an essence.) The answer is, not at all; and this is the\nunique paradox of the relation between discourse and sovereignty. To\nrelate the major form of writing to the sovereign operation is to insti-\ntute a relation in the form of a nonrelation, to inscribe rupture in the\ntext, to place the chain of discursive knowledge in relation to an\nunknowledge which is not a moment of knowledge: an absolute\nunknowledge from whose nonbasis is launched chance, or the wagers\nfrom restricted to general economy 339\n"

It is\nnot a question of subordinating the slidings and di\ufb00erences of dis-\ncourse, the play of syntax, to the entirety of an anticipated discourse.\nOn the contrary. If the play of di\ufb00erence is indispensable for the correct\nreading of the general economy\u2019s concepts, and if each notion must be\nreinscribed within the law of its own sliding and must be related to the\nsovereign operation, one must not make of these requirements the\nsubordinate moment of a structure.

When L\u00e9vi-Strauss says in the preface to The Raw and the Cooked\nthat he has \u201csought to transcend the opposition between the sensi-\nble and the intelligible by operating from the outset at the level of\nsigns,\u201d2 the necessity, force, and legitimacy of his act cannot make us\nforget that the concept of the sign cannot in itself surpass this oppos-\nition between the sensible and the intelligible. The concept of the sign,\nin each of its aspects, has been determined by this opposition through-\nout the totality of its history. It has lived only on this opposition and its\nsystem. But we cannot do without the concept of the sign, for we\ncannot give up this metaphysical complicity without also giving up the\ncritique we are directing against this complicity, or without the risk of\nerasing di\ufb00erence in the self-identity of a signi\ufb01ed reducing its signi-\n\ufb01er into itself or, amounting to the same thing, simply expelling its\nsigni\ufb01er outside itself. For there are two heterogenous ways of erasing\nthe di\ufb00erence between the signi\ufb01er and the signi\ufb01ed: one, the classic\nway, consists in reducing or deriving the signi\ufb01er, that is to say, ultim-\nately in submitting the sign to thought; the other, the one we are using\nhere against the \ufb01rst one, consists in putting into question the system\nin which the preceding reduction functioned: \ufb01rst and foremost, the\nopposition between the sensible and the intelligible. For the paradox is\nthat the metaphysical reduction of the sign needed the opposition it\nwas reducing. The opposition is systematic with the reduction. And\nwhat we are saying here about the sign can be extended to all the\nconcepts and all the sentences of metaphysics, in particular to the\ndiscourse on \u201cstructure.\u201d But there are several ways of being caught in\nthis circle. They are all more or less na\u00efve, more or less empirical, more\nor less systematic, more or less close to the formulation\u2014that is, to the\nformalization\u2014of this circle. It is these di\ufb00erences which explain the\nmultiplicity of destructive discourses and the disagreement between\nthose who elaborate them. Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger, for\nexample, worked within the inherited concepts of metaphysics. Since\nthese concepts are not elements or atoms, and since they are taken from\na syntax and a system, every particular borrowing brings along with it\nstructure, sign and play 355\n"

One reads in The Savage Mind, \u201cLike\nbricolage on the technical plane, mythical re\ufb02ection can reach brilliant\nunforeseen results on the intellectual plane. Conversely, attention has\noften been drawn to the mythopoetical nature of bricolage.\u201d6\nBut L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s remarkable endeavor does not simply consist in\nproposing, notably in his most recent investigations, a structural sci-\nence of myths and of mythological activity. His endeavor also\nappears\u2014I would say almost from the outset\u2014to have the status which\nhe accords to his own discourse on myths, to what he calls his \u201cmytho-\nlogicals.\u201d It is here that his discourse on the myth re\ufb02ects on itself and\ncriticizes itself. And this moment, this critical period, is evidently of\nconcern to all the languages which share the \ufb01eld of the human sci-\nences. What does L\u00e9vi-Strauss say of his \u201cmythologicals\u201d? It is here that\nwe rediscover the mythopoetical virtue of bricolage. In e\ufb00ect, what\nappears most fascinating in this critical search for a new status of\ndiscourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a\nsubject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute archia. The\ntheme of this decentering could be followed throughout the \u201cOver-\nture\u201d to his last book, The Raw and the Cooked. I shall simply remark on a\nfew key points.\n1. From the very start, L\u00e9vi-Strauss recognizes that the Bororo myth\nwhich he employs in the book as the \u201creference myth\u201d does not merit\nthis name and this treatment. The name is specious and the use of the\nmyth improper. This myth deserves no more than any other its referen-\ntial privilege: \u201cIn fact, the Bororo myth, which I shall refer to from now\non as the key myth, is, as I shall try to show, simply a transformation, to\na greater or lesser extent, of other myths originating either in the same\nsociety or in neighboring or remote societies. I could, therefore, have\nlegitimately taken as my starting point any one representative myth of\nthe group. From this point of view, the key myth is interesting not\nbecause it is typical, but rather because of its irregular position within\nthe group.\u201d7\nstructure, sign and play 361\n"

It must avoid the violence that consists in\ncentering a language which describes an acentric structure if it is not to\nshortchange the form and movement of myth.

This is what L\u00e9vi-\nStrauss says in The Raw and the Cooked, from which I would now like to\nquote a long and remarkable passage:\nThe study of myths raises a methodological problem, in that it cannot\nbe carried out according to the Cartesian principle of breaking down\nthe dif\ufb01culty into as many parts as may be necessary for \ufb01nding the\nsolution. There is no real end to methodological analysis, no hidden\nunity to be grasped once the breaking-down process has been com-\npleted. Themes can be split up ad in\ufb01nitum. Just when you think you\nhave disentangled and separated them, you realize that they are knit-\nting together again in response to the operation of unexpected af\ufb01n-\nities. Consequently the unity of the myth is never more than tendential\nand projective and cannot re\ufb02ect a state or a particular moment of the\nmyth. It is a phenomenon of the imagination, resulting from the\nattempt at interpretation; and its function is to endow the myth with\nsynthetic form and to prevent its disintegration into a confusion of\nopposites. The science of myths might therefore be termed \u201canaclas-\ntic,\u201d if we take this old term in the broader etymological sense which\nincludes the study of both re\ufb02ected rays and broken rays. But unlike\nphilosophical re\ufb02ection, which aims to go back to its own source, the\nre\ufb02ections we are dealing with here concern rays whose only source is\nhypothetical. . . .

The risk I am speaking of is always assumed\nby L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and it is the very price of this endeavor. I have said that\nempiricism is the matrix of all faults menacing a discourse which\ncontinues, as with L\u00e9vi-Strauss in particular, to consider itself scienti\ufb01c.\nIf we wanted to pose the problem of empiricism and bricolage in depth,\nwe would probably end up very quickly with a number of absolutely\ncontradictory propositions concerning the status of discourse in struc-\ntural ethnology. On the one hand, structuralism justi\ufb01ably claims to be\nthe critique of empiricism. But at the same time there is not a single\nbook or study by L\u00e9vi-Strauss which is not proposed as an empirical\nessay which can always be completed or invalidated by new informa-\ntion. The structural schemata are always proposed as hypotheses result-\ning from a \ufb01nite quantity of information and which are subjected to\nthe proof of experience. Numerous texts could be used to demonstrate\nthis double postulation. Let us turn once again to the \u201cOverture\u201d of The\nRaw and the Cooked, where it seems clear that if this postulation is double,\nit is because it is a question here of a language on language:\nIf critics reproach me with not having carried out an exhaustive inven-\ntory of South American myths before analyzing them, they are making\na grave mistake about the nature and function of these documents.\nThe total body of myth belonging to a given community is comparable\nto its speech. Unless the population dies out physically or morally, this\ntotality is never complete. You might as well criticize a linguist for\ncompiling the grammar of a language without having complete\nrecords of the words pronounced since the language came into being,\nand without knowing what will be said in it during the future part of its\nexistence. Experience proves that a linguist can work out the grammar\nof a given language from a remarkably small number of sentences. . . .\nAnd even a partial grammar or an outline grammar is a precious\nacquisition when we are dealing with unknown languages.

This is no doubt due to the fact that there are two ways of\nconceiving the limit of totalization. And I assert once more that these\ntwo determinations coexist implicitly in L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s discourse. Total-\nization can be judged impossible in the classical style: one then refers\nto the empirical endeavor of either a subject or a \ufb01nite richness which\nit can never master. There is too much, more than one can say. But\nnontotalization can also be determined in another way: no longer from\nthe standpoint of a concept of \ufb01nitude as relegation to the empirical,\nbut from the standpoint of the concept of play. If totalization no longer\nhas any meaning, it is not because the in\ufb01niteness of a \ufb01eld cannot be\ncovered by a \ufb01nite glance or a \ufb01nite discourse, but because the nature\nof the \ufb01eld\u2014that is, language and a \ufb01nite language\u2014excludes totaliza-\ntion. This \ufb01eld is in e\ufb00ect that of play, that is to say, a \ufb01eld of in\ufb01nite\nsubstitutions only because it is \ufb01nite, that is to say, because instead of\nbeing an inexhaustible \ufb01eld, as in the classical hypothesis, instead of\nbeing too large, there is something missing from it: a center which\narrests and grounds the play of substitutions. One could say\u2014\nrigorously using that word whose scandalous signi\ufb01cation is always\nobliterated in French\u2014that this movement of play, permitted by the\nlack or absence of a center or origin, is the movement of supplementarity.\nOne cannot determine the center and exhaust totalization because the\nsign which replaces the center, which supplements it, taking the cen-\nter\u2019s place in its absence\u2014this sign is added, occurs as a surplus, as a\nsupplement.12 The movement of signi\ufb01cation adds something, which\nresults in the fact that there is always more, but this addition is a\n\ufb02oating one because it comes to perform a vicarious function, to\nstructure, sign and play 365\n"

For example: \u2018A zero phoneme is opposed to all the other phon-\nemes in French in that it entails no di\ufb00erential characters and no con-\nstant phonetic value. On the contrary, the proper function of the zero\nphoneme is to be opposed to phoneme absence.\u2019 (R.

Similarly, if we schematize the conception I am propos-\ning here, it could almost be said that the function of notions like mana is\nto be opposed to the absence of signi\ufb01cation, without entailing by\nitself any particular signi\ufb01cation.\u201d14\nThe overabundance of the signi\ufb01er, its supplementary character, is thus the\nresult of a \ufb01nitude, that is to say, the result of a lack which must be\nsupplemented.\nIt can now be understood why the concept of play is important in\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss.

Further, the reference to play is always caught up in\ntension.\nTension with history, \ufb01rst of all. This is a classical problem, objec-\ntions to which are now well worn. I shall simply indicate what seems to\nme the formality of the problem: by reducing history, L\u00e9vi-Strauss has\ntreated as it deserves a concept which has always been in complicity\nwith a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words,\nparadoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which\nit was believed history could be opposed. The thematic of historicity,\nalthough it seems to be a somewhat late arrival in philosophy, has\nalways been required by the determination of Being as presence. With\nor without etymology, and despite the classic antagonism which\nopposes these signi\ufb01cations throughout all of classical thought, it could\nbe shown that the concept of episte\u00afme\u00af has always called forth that of\nhistoria, if history is always the unity of a becoming, as the tradition of\nstructure, sign and play 367\n"

TN. The most consistently dif\ufb01cult sections of Derrida\u2019s texts are his\n\u201cprefatory\u201d remarks, for reasons that he has explained in \u201cHors-livre,\u201d\nthe preface to La diss\u00e9mination (Paris: Seuil, 1972). The question\nhinges upon the classical difference between a philosophical text and\nits preface, the preface usually being a recapitulation of the truth pre-\nsented by the text. Since Derrida challenges the notion that a text can\npresent a truth, his prefaces\u2014in which this challenge is anticipated\u2014\nmust especially mark that which makes a text explode the classical\nideas of truth and presence. And they must do so without letting the\npreface anticipate this \u201cconclusion\u201d as a single, clear, luminous truth.\nThus the complication of these prefaces. One way of complicating a\npreface is to leave as a knot that which will later become several\nstrands. Here, the relationship between history, somnambulism, the\n\u201cquestion\u201d and the difference between almost-everything and almost-\nnothing is not explained, for the unraveling of this question touches at\nleast on the topics of the relationship between history and philosophy\n(cf. below, \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d), and the relation of both of\nthese, as writing or texts, to Freud\u2019s analysis of the \u201ctext of somnambu-\nlism,\u201d i.e., The interpretation of Dreams (cf. below, \u201cFreud and the\nScene of Writing\u201d).\n4. On the theme of the separation of the writer, cf. particularly chapter 3 of\nJean Rousset\u2019s introduction of his Forme et Signi\ufb01cation. Delacroix,\nDiderot, Balzac, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, Proust, Val\u00e9ry, Henry James,\nT. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf are called upon to bear witness to the fact\nthat separation is diametrically opposed to critical impotency. By\ninsisting upon this separation between the critical act and creative\nforce, we are only designating the most banally essential\u2014others\nmight say, structural\u2014necessity attached to these two actions and\nmoments. Impotence, here, is a property not of the critic but of criti-\ncism. The two are sometimes confused. Flaubert does not deny him-\nself this confusion. This is brought to light in the admirable collection\nof letters edited by Genevi\u00e8ve Boll\u00e8me and entitled Pr\u00e9face \u00e0 la vie\nnotes to pages 2\u20133\n380\n"

Attentive to the fact that the critic takes\nhis material from the work rather than bringing anything to it, Flaubert\nwrites: \u201cOne writes criticism when one cannot create art, just as one\nbecomes a spy when one cannot be a soldier . . . . Plautus would have\nlaughed at Aristotle had he known him! Corneille resisted him all he\ncould! Voltaire himself was belittled by Boileau!

Or that Mallarm\u00e9 chose, at least, to approach Hegel.\nIn any event, genius still has some respite, and translations can be left\nunread. But Flaubert was right to fear Hegel: \u201cOne may well hope that\nart will continue to advance and perfect itself, but its form has ceased\nto be the highest need of the spirit.

We must now af\ufb01x to this another essential characteristic\nof Corneillean drama: the movement it describes is an ascending\nmovement toward a center situated in in\ufb01nity.\u201d (In this spatial\nschema, what happens to in\ufb01nity, which is here the essential, that\nis, is not only the irreducible speci\ufb01city of the \u201cmovement,\u201d but also\nits qualitative speci\ufb01city?) \u201cIts nature can be further speci\ufb01ed. An\nupward movement of two rings is a helical ascent; two ascending\nlines separate, cross, move away from and rejoin each other in a\ncommon pro\ufb01le beyond the play itself (the structural meaning\nof the expression \u201cbeyond the play itself?\u201d) \u201c . . . Pauline and Poly-\neucte meet and separate in the \ufb01rst act; they meet again, closer to\neach other and on a higher plane, in the third act, only to separate\nagain; they climb up another level and reunite in the \ufb01fth act, the\nculminating phase of the ascension, from whence they jump forth\nin a \ufb01nal leap which will unite them de\ufb01nitively, at the supreme point\nof freedom and triumph, in God\u201d (Rousset, Forme et Signi\ufb01cation,\np. 6).\n44.

I.e., of structure as a metaphor for locality, site.\n48. TN. This is the question of the closure of metaphysics, for metaphys-\nics contains every discourse that attempts to emerge from it. Accord-\ning to Derrida, metaphysics can only be destroyed from within, by\nmaking its own language\u2014which is the only language we have\u2014work\nagainst it.\n49. Here are several formulations of this \u201cpermanent structure\u201d: \u201cwhere\nis the true play? It is in the superimposing and interweaving of the two\nlevels, in the separations and exchanges established between them,\noffering us the subtle pleasure of binocular viewing and double read-\ning\u201d (Rousset, Forme et Signi\ufb01cation, p. 56). \u201cFrom this point of view, all\nof Marivaux\u2019s plays could be de\ufb01ned as an organism existing on two\nlevels whose designs gradually approach until they are completely\njoined. The play is over when the two levels are indistinguishable, that\nis, when the group of heroes watched by the spectators sees itself as\nthe spectator-characters saw them. The real resolution is not the mar-\nriage promised to us at the fall of the curtain but the encounter of\nheart and vision\u201d (ibid., p. 58) \u201cWe are invited to follow the develop-\nment of the play in two registers, which offer us two parallel curves\nthat are separated, however, different in their importance, their lan-\nguage, and their function: the one rapidly sketched, the other fully\ndrawn in all its complexity, the \ufb01rst letting us guess the direction that\nthe second will take, the second deeply echoing the \ufb01rst, providing its\nde\ufb01nitive meaning. This play of interior re\ufb02ections contributes to the\nimparting of a rigorous and supple geometry to Marivaux\u2019s play, while\nat the same time closely linking the two registers, even up to the\nmovements of love\u201d (ibid., p. 59).\n50.

Madness, theme or index: what is signi\ufb01cant is that Descartes, at bot-\ntom, never speaks of madness itself in this text. Madness is not his\ntheme. He treats it as the index of a question of principle, that is, of\nepistemological value. It will be said, perhaps, that this is the sign of a\nprofound exclusion. But this silence on madness itself simultaneously\nsigni\ufb01es the opposite of an exclusion, since it is not a question of\nmadness in this text, if only to exclude it. It is not in the Meditations that\nDescartes speaks of madness itself.\n16. To underline this vulnerability and touch on the greatest dif\ufb01culty, we\nwould have to specify that the expressions \u201csensory or corporeal fault\u201d\nor \u201ccorporeal error\u201d could have no meaning for Descartes. There is no\ncorporeal error, particularly in illness: jaundice or melancholy are only\nthe occasions of an error that itself is born only with the consent or\naf\ufb01rmation of the will in judgment, when \u201cone who is ill with jaundice\njudges everything to be yellow because his eye is tinged with yellow. So\n\ufb01nally, too, when the imagination is diseased, as in cases of melan-\ncholia, and a man thinks that his own disorderly fancies represent real\nthings\u201d (Rule XII. Descartes emphasizes this point: the most\nabnormal sensory or imaginative experience, considered in and of\nitself, at its own level and at its proper moment, never deceives us; or\nnever deceives understanding, \u201cif it restrict its attention accurately to\nthe object presented to it, just as it is given to it either \ufb01rsthand or by\nmeans of an image; and if it moreover refrain from judging that the\nimagination faithfully reports the objects of the senses, or that the\nsenses take on the true forms of things, or in \ufb01ne that external things\nalways are as they appear to be\u201d [Haldane and Ross, p. 44].)\n17.

After desiring to restore the properly ontological intention dormant\nwithin metaphysics, after having reawakened the \u201cfundamental ontol-\nogy\u201d beneath \u201cmetaphysical ontology,\u201d Heidegger, faced by the ten-\nacity of traditional ambiguity, \ufb01nally proposes to abandon the terms\n\u201contology\u201d and \u201contological\u201d (Introduction to Metaphysics). The ques-\ntion of Being cannot be submitted to an ontology.\n4. That is, to relativism: the truth of philosophy does not depend upon its\nrelation to the actuality of the Greek or European event. On the con-\ntrary, we must gain access to the Greek or European eidos through an\nirruption or a call whose point of departure is variously determined by\nHusserl and Heidegger. It remains that, for both, \u201cthe irruption of\nphilosophy\u201d (\u201cAufbruch oder Einbruch der Philosophie,\u201d Husserl, Kri-\nsis . . .) is the \u201coriginal\u201d phenomenon which characterizes Europe as a\n\u201cspiritual \ufb01gure\u201d (ibid.). For both, the \u201cword philosophia tells us that\nphilosophy is something which, \ufb01rst of all, determines the existence of\nthe Greek world. Not only that\u2014philosophia also determines the\ninnermost basic feature of our Western-European history, the often\nheard expression \u2018Western-European philosophy\u2019 is, in truth, a tautol-\nogy. Why? Because philosophy is Greek in its nature; Greek, in this\ninstance, means that in origin the nature of philosophy is of such a\nkind that it \ufb01rst appropriated the Greek world, and only it, in order to\nunfold.\u201d Heidegger, What Is Philosophy?, trans.

There follows a description of the preobjective\nsphere of an intentional experience absolutely departing from itself\ntoward the other (a description, however, which has never seemed to\nus to exceed certain Husserlian literality). Same schema in Totality\nand In\ufb01nity: Husserl\u2019s \u201cessential teaching\u201d is opposed to its \u201cletter\u201d:\n\u201cWhat does it matter if in the Husserlian phenomenology taken liter-\nally these unsuspected horizons are in their turn interpreted as\nthoughts aiming at objects?\u201d (TI, p. 28).\n15. A proposition that Husserl doubtless would not have accepted easily.\nSimilarly, does the entire analysis devoted to the doxical thesis and to\nparagraph 117 of Ideas (Theory of Intuition, p. 192) take into account\nthe extraordinary enlargement of the notions of thesis and doxa\neffected by Husserl, who is already showing such care in respecting\nthe originality of the practical, the axiological, and the aesthetic? As for\nthe meaning of the reduction, it is true that in 1930, and in his pub-\nlished works, Husserl had not yet made it into a theme. We will come\nback to this. For the moment we are not interested in Husserlian truth,\nbut in Levinas\u2019s itinerary.\n16. As concerns representation, an important motif in the divergence, as\nconcerns its dignity and status in Husserlian phenomenology, Levinas,\nhowever, never seems to have stopped hesitating. But again, almost\nalways, it is a hesitation between the spirit and the letter. Sometimes\ntoo between law and fact. This movement can be followed through the\nfollowing passages: THI, pp. 90ff.; EDE, pp. 22\u201323, esp. p. 52; La tech-\nnique ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologique, pp. 98\u201399; TI, pp. 95ff.\n17. In EDE, at a time (1940\u201349) when the surprises in this area were no\nlonger held in store, the theme of this criticism still will be central: \u201cIn\nHusserl the phenomenon of meaning has never been determined by\nhistory.\u201d (We do not mean to say, here, that this sentence is \ufb01nally in\ncontradiction with Husserl\u2019s then known intentions. But are not the\nlatter, whatever the de\ufb01nitive heart of the matter, already more prob-\nlematical than Levinas seems to believe?)\n18. TN.

Anamnesis too, would be a procession of the Same. On this\npoint, at least, Levinas cannot oppose himself to Kierkegaard (cf., for\nexample, J. Wahl, Etudes Kierkegaardiennes, pp. 308\u20139), for his critique\nof Platonism here is literally Kierkegaardian.

Here we are thinking of the distinction between discourse and vio-\nlence particularly common to Levinas and to Eric Weil. It does not have\nthe same meaning for both. Levinas notes this in passing and, while\npaying homage to Weil for his \u201csystematic and vigorous use of the\nterm violence in its opposition to discourse,\u201d claims to give \u201cdifferent\nmeaning\u201d to this distinction (DL). We would be tempted to give a\ndiametrically opposed meaning. The discourse which Weil acknow-\nledges as nonviolent is ontology, the project of ontology. (Cf. Logique\nde la philosophie, e.g., pp. 28ff. \u201cLa naissance de l\u2019ontologie, le dis-\ncours.\u201d) \u201cHarmony between men will be established by itself if men\nare not concerned with themselves, but with what is;\u201d its polarity is\nin\ufb01nite coherence, and its style, at least, is Hegelian. This coherence in\nontology is violence itself for Levinas: the \u201cend of history\u201d is not abso-\nlute Logic, the absolute coherence of the Logos with itself in itself; nor\nis it harmony in the absolute System, but Peace in separation, the\ndiaspora of absolutes. Inversely, is not peaceful discourse, according\nto Levinas, the discourse which respects separation and rejects the\nhorizon of ontological coherence, violence itself for Weil? Let us\nschematize: according to Weil, violence will be, or rather would be,\nreduced only with the reduction of alterity, or the will to alterity. The\nreverse is true for Levinas. But for Levinas coherence is always \ufb01nite\n(totality, in the meaning he gives to the word, rejecting any possible\nmeaning for the notion of in\ufb01nite totality). For Weil, it is the notion of\nalterity, on the contrary, which implies irreducible \ufb01nitude. But for\nboth, only the in\ufb01nite is nonviolent, and it can be announced only in\ndiscourse. One should examine the common presuppositions of this\nconvergence and divergence. One should ask whether the pre-\ndetermination, common to these two systems, of violation and of pure\nlogos, and, above all, the predetermination of their incompatability,\nrefers to an absolute truth, or perhaps to an epoch of the history of\nthought, the history of Being. Let us note that Bataille too, in Eroticism,\ndraws inspiration from Weil\u2019s concepts, and states this explicitly.\n43. TN. Derrida is playing on the double sense of regard as ethical concern\nand as objectifying glance. Cf. note 10 above.\n44. At bottom, it is the very notion of a \u201cconstitution of an alter ego\u201d to\nwhich Levinas refuses any merit. He would probably say, with Sartre,\n\u201cOne encounters the Other, one does not constitute it\u201d (Being and\nnotes to pages 136\u201354 403\n"

Or at least cannot be, or be anything; and it is indeed the authority of\nBeing which Levinas profoundly questions. That his discourse must\nstill submit to the contested agency is a necessity whose rule we must\nattempt to inscribe systematically in the text.\n46.

The same is\nnot a category, but the possibility of every category. Here, we should\nattentively compare Levinas\u2019s theses with Heidegger\u2019s text entitled\nIdentity and Difference (1957). For Levinas, the same is the concept,\njust as Being and unity are concepts, and these three concepts\nimmediately communicate among each other (cf. TI p. 274, for\nexample).

In his very \ufb01ne study, Heidegger et la pens\u00e9e de la \ufb01nitude, Henri Birault\nshows how the theme of Endlichkeit is progressively abandoned by\nHeidegger, for \u201cthe same reason which had motivated its use at a cer-\ntain time\u201d due to \u201cconcern for separating from the thought of Being\nnot only the survivals and metamorphoses of Christian theology, but\nstill the theological itself, which is absolutely constitutive of metaphys-\nics as such. In effect, if the Heideggerean concept of Endlichkeit was\nnever the Christian-theological concept of \ufb01nitude, it nevertheless\nremains that the idea of \ufb01nite Being is in itself ontologically theological\nand, as such, is incapable of satisfying a thought which draws back\nfrom Metaphysics only to meditate, in the light of the forgotten truth\nof Being, the still hidden unity of its onto-theological essence\u201d (Revue\ninternationale de philosophie, 1960, no. 52). A thought which seeks to\ngo to its very end in its language, to the end of what it envisages under\nthe name of original \ufb01nitude or \ufb01nitude of Being, therefore should\nabandon not only the words and themes of the \ufb01nite and the in\ufb01nite,\nbut also, which is doubtless impossible, everything that they govern in\nlanguage, in the deepest sense of the word. This last impossibility\ndoes not signify that the beyond of metaphysics is impracticable; on\nthe contrary, it con\ufb01rms the necessity for this incommensurable over-\n\ufb02ow to take support from metaphysics. A necessity clearly recognized\nby Heidegger.

Since we cannot unfold this debate here, we will refer to the clearest of\nHeidegger\u2019s texts on this point: (a) Sein und Zeit: the themes of essen-\ntial Unheimlichkeit, of the \u201cnudity\u201d of being-in-the-world, \u201cals Un-\nzuhause.\u201d It is precisely this authentic condition that the neutral exist-\nence of the One \ufb02ees from.

Nationalism is not overcome by\npure internationalism, but is rather enlarged and Set up as a system.\u201d\n(d) Finally, as concerns the dwelling and the home (whose praises\nLevinas also understands himself to sing, but, it is true, as a moment\nof interiority, and precisely as economy), Heidegger indeed speci\ufb01es\nthat the home does not metaphorically determine Being on the basis\nof its economy but, on the contrary, can only be determined as such on\nthe basis of the essence of Being. Cf. also . . . L\u2019homme habite en po\u00e8te,\nin which, let us note in passing, Heidegger distinguishes the Same\nand the Equal (das Selbe\u2014das Gleiche): \u201cThe Same sets to one side any\nhaste to resolve differences in the Equal,\u201d in Essais et conf\u00e9rences.\n81.

The problem which presents itself to\nScotus\u2014and which is the one which occupies us here, in the dialogue\nbetween Levinas and Heidegger\u2014\u201cis therefore posed on a terrain,\u201d\nwrites Gilson, \u201cwhich is no longer Aristotle\u2019s nor Aquinas\u2019s, because in\norder to penetrate it, one must \ufb01rst have emerged from the dilemma\nimposed by Aristotelianism between the universal and the singular,\nthe \u2018\ufb01rst\u2019 and the \u2018second,\u2019 and thereby have escaped the necessity of\nchoosing between the analogous and the uniform, which can only be\naccomplished by isolating a notion of Being in some way metaphysic-\nally pure of all determination\u201d (ibid., p. 89).

Sartre, like Levinas, had earlier interpreted the Mitsein in the sense of\ncamaraderie, the team, etc. Here, we refer to Being and Time. Cf. also,\nLe concept du monde chez Heidegger. In this work, Walter Biemel, with\nmuch precision and clarity, confronts this interpretation with\nHeidegger\u2019s intentions (pp. 90ff). Let us add simply that the with of\nthe Mitsein originally no more denotes the structure of a team ani-\nmated by a neutral common task than does the with of the \u201clanguage\nwith God\u201d (TI). The Being which can interpellate the Mitsein is not, as\nLevinas often gives us to understand, a third term, a common truth,\netc. Finally, the notion of Mitsein describes an original structure of the\nrelationship between Da-Sein and Da-Sein which is prior to every\nmeaning of \u201cencounter\u201d or of \u201cconstitution,\u201d that is, to the debate\nwhich we mentioned above.

Entre deux mondes (\u201cBiographie spirituelle de Franz Rosenzweig\u201d in La\nconscience juive [Paris: P.U.F. 1963], p. 126). This lecture, along with an\narticle by A. N\u00e9her (Cahiers de l\u2019Institut de science \u00e9conomique appliqu\u00e9,\n1959, is the only important text devoted to Rosenzweig, better known\nin France as the author of Hegel und der Staat than of Der Stern der\nErl\u00f6sung (The Star of Redemption, 1921). Rosenzweig\u2019s in\ufb02uence on\nLevinas seems to have been profound. \u201cWe were impressed by the\nopposition to the idea of totality in Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s Stern der Erl-\n\u00f6sung, a work too often present in this book to be cited\u201d TI, p. 28.\n90. In his Exposition of Philosophical Empiricism Schelling wrote: \u201cThus God\nwould be Being enclosed in itself in an absolute manner, would be\nsubstance in the most elevated sense, free of every relation. But from\nthe very fact that we consider these determinations as purely imma-\nnent, as relating to nothing external, one \ufb01nds oneself in the necessity\nof having to conceive them by parting from Him, that is, to conceive\nhim as the prius, that is as the absolute prius. And it is thus that,\npushed to its \ufb01nal consequences, empiricism leads us to the supra-\nempirical.\u201d Naturally, by \u201cenclosed\u201d and \u201cenfolded\u201d one is not to\nunderstand \ufb01nite closure and egoistic muteness, but rather absolute\nalterity, what Levinas calls the In\ufb01nite absolved of relation. An analo-\ngous movement is outlined in Bergson, who, in his Introduction to\nMetaphysics, criticizes the empiricist doctrines unfaithful to pure\nexperience in the name of true empiricism, and concludes: \u201cThis true\nempiricism is the true metaphysics.\u201d\n91. Pure difference is not absolutely different (from nondifference).\nHegel\u2019s critique of the concept of pure difference is for us here, doubt-\nless, the most uncircumventable theme. Hegel thought absolute dif-\nference, and showed that it can be pure only by being impure. In the\nScience of Logic, as concerns Absolute Difference, Hegel writes, for\nexample: \u201cThis difference is difference in-and-for-itself, absolute dif-\nference, the difference of Essence. It is difference in-and-for-itself not\nby the effect of an external cause, but a difference in relation to itself,\nthus a simple difference. It is essential to see in absolute difference a\nsimple difference . . . Difference in itself is difference in relation to\nitself; thus it is its own negativity, difference not in relation to an other,\nbut in relation to itself . . . What differentiates difference is identity.\nDifference, thus, is both itself and identity. Both together make\nnotes to pages 186\u201392 411\n"

In the Logische Untersuchungen he writes: \u201cI set out from\nan absolute conviction that, like logic in general, the logic of deductive\nscience awaited its philosophical clari\ufb01cation from psychology (ibid.,\nvol. 1, p. vi). And an article written shortly after the Philosophic der\nArithmetik, Husserl asserts again: \u201cI believe it possible to maintain\nthat no theory of judgment will ever be in agreement with the facts if it\nis not based upon a profound study of the descriptive and genetic\nrelations between intuitions and representations\u201d (\u201cPsychologische\nStudien zur elementaren Logik,\u201d Philosophische Monatshefte 33 [Berlin,\n1894]: 187 (my italics).\n4.

Speaking of the attempt made in Philosophie der Arithmetik, Husserl\nnotes, in the preface to the Logische Untersuchungen: \u201cCorrespond-\ningly, the psychological researches occupy a very large place in the \ufb01rst\n(and only published) volume of my philosophy of arithmetic. This\npsychological foundation never seemed to me to suf\ufb01ce for certain\ndevelopments. Whenever it was a question of the origin of mathemat-\nical determinations, or of the in fact psychologically determined shap-\ning of practical methods, the results of psychological analysis\nappeared to me to be clear and instructive. But as soon as the transi-\ntion from the psychological developments of thought to the logical\nunity of the content of thought (the unity of theory) was made, no real\ncontinuity or clarity was apparent\u201d (ibid., vol. 1, p. vii).\n6.\nHusserl writes: \u201cI do not understand how he [Dilthey] believes that he\nhas gained decisive grounds against skepticism on the basis of his very\ninstructive analysis of the structure and typology of Weltanschauun-\ngen\u201d (Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft [Frankfurt 1965], p. 53). Nat-\nurally, historicism is condemned only to the extent that it is necessarily\ntied to an empirical history, to a history as Tatsachenwissenschaft. \u201cHis-\ntory, the empirical science of the mind in general, is incapable of decid-\ning by its own means whether or not religion should be distinguished\nnotes to pages 195\u2013200 413\n"

Notably this is the project of K\u00f6hler, for whom psychology must sur-\nrender to \u201cphenomenological description,\u201d and of Koffka, a disciple of\nHusserl who seeks to show, in his Principles of Gestalt Psychology, that\nthe \u201cpsychology of form\u201d escapes the criticism of psychologism by\nmeans of its structuralism.\nThe conjunction of phenomenology and the \u201cpsychology of form\u201d\nwas readily foreseeable.

Heretofore we\nhave touched on only one side of this self-constitution, we have looked\nat only the \ufb02owing cogito. The ego grasps himself not only as a \ufb02owing\nlife but also as I, who live this and that subjective process, who live\nthrough this and that cogito as the same I. Since we were busied up to\nnow with the intentional relation of consciousness to object, cogito to\ncogitatum . . .\u201d etc. (ibid., p. 66).\n22. \u201cAccess to the ultimate universalities involved in problems of eidetic\nphenomenology is, however, very dif\ufb01cult.

Each time that it operates within the framework that we are attempting\nto restore here, Artaud\u2019s language has a precise resemblance, in its\nsyntax and vocabulary, to that of the young Marx. In the \ufb01rst of the\nEconomic and Political Manuscripts of 1844, the labor which produces\nthe work and gives it value (Verwertung) proportionately increases the\nde-preciation (Entwertung) of its author. \u201cLabor\u2019s realization is its\nobjecti\ufb01cation. In the sphere of political economy this realization of\nlabor appears as loss of realization for the workers; objecti\ufb01cation as\nloss of the object and bondage to it; appropriation as estrangement, as\nalienation\u201d (Karl Marx, Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,\ntrans.

In the Preface to his Collected Works, Artaud writes: \u201cThe cane of \u2018The\nNew Revelations of Being\u2019 fell into the black cyst along with the little\nsword.

Artaud\nwrites further on: \u201cNo, Socrates did not have this eye; perhaps the only\none before Van Gogh was the unhappy Nietzsche who had the same\npower to undress the soul, to pluck the body from the soul, to lay the\nbody of man bare, beyond the subterfuges of the mind\u201d (AA, p. 160).\n27.

And here, as in The Theater and Its Double, the place of the text\nis recognized as that of usurped mastery and as the proper, nonmeta-\nphorical, practice of slavery. To have the text at one\u2019s disposition is to\nbe a master. \u201cOpera is the birth of the theoretical man, of the critical\nlayman, not of the artist: one of the most surprising facts in the whole\nhistory of art. It was the demand of thoroughly unmusical hearers that\nthe words must above all be understood, so that according to them a\nre-birth of music is only to be expected when some mode of singing\nhas been discovered in which the text-word lords over the counter-\npoint as the master over the servant\u201d (Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of\nTragedy, trans. William A. Houssman [New York: Russell and Russell,\n1964], p. 145).

A task that appears to my mind like that of a son\nwanting to create his father!\u201d ibid. p. 33)\u2014numerous formulations\nannounce Artaud. But here it is music, as elsewhere dance, that\nNietzsche wants to liberate from the text and from recitation. Doubt-\nless, an abstract liberation in Artaud\u2019s eyes. Only the theater, the total\nart including and utilizing music and dance among other forms of\nlanguage, can accomplish this liberation. It must be noted that if\nArtaud, like Nietzsche, often supports dance, he never abstracts it\nfrom the theater. If one heedlessly takes dance literally, and not, as we\nsaid above, in an analogical sense, it would not be the entirety of\ntheater. Artaud, perhaps, would not say, as Nietzsche did, \u201cI can only\nbelieve in a God who would dance.\u201d Not only because God could not\ndance, as Nietzsche knew, but because dance alone is an impover-\nished theater. This speci\ufb01cation was even more necessary in that Zar-\nathustra condemns poets and poetic works as the alienation of the\nbody into metaphor. On Poets begins thus.: \u201c \u2018 Since I have known the\nbody better,\u2019 said Zarathustra to one of his disciples\u2014\u2018the spirit hath\nonly been to me symbolically spirit; and all that is \u2018imperishable\u2019\u2014\nThat is also but a simile.\u2019 \u2018So have I heard thee say once before,\u2019\nanswered the disciple \u2018and then thou addedst: \u201cBut the poets lie too\nmuch.\u201d Why didst thou say that the poets lie too much?\u2019 . . . \u2018And fain\nnotes to page 233 423\n"

Phonologism is Derrida\u2019s abbreviated fashion of describing one of\nthe metaphysical gestures inherent in most linguistics: the privilege\ngiven to a model of language based on speech, because speech is the\nmost present form of language, is presence in language. This is equiva-\nlent to the metaphysical repression of writing, i.e., of difference. Here,\ntoo, Derrida might be challenging Jacques Lacan, whose statement\nabout the unconscious being structured like a language seems to\ndepend upon many of the linguistic conceptions which Derrida con-\nsiders to be uncritically metaphysical.\n2. TN. \u201cBreaching\u201d is the translation we have adopted for the German\nword Bahnung. Bahnung is derived from Bahn, road, and literally\nmeans pathbreaking. Derrida\u2019s translation of Bahnung is frayage,\nwhich has an idiomatic connection to pathbreaking in the expression,\nse frayer un chemin. \u201cBreaching\u201d is clumsy, but it is crucial to maintain\nthe sense of the force that breaks open a pathway, and the space\nopened by this force; thus, \u201cbreaching\u201d must be understood here as a\nshorthand for these meanings. In the Standard Edition Bahnung has\nbeen translated as \u201cfacilitation,\u201d and we have, of course, maintained\nthis in all citations from the Standard Edition.

TN. Derrida seems to be making a point here which is developed much\nmore fully in \u201cFrom Restricted to General Economy\u201d (see this volume,\nchap. 9). He seems to be referring, if rather elliptically, to the Hegelian\ndialectic of the master and the slave, in which the master, who both\nrisks death and consumes with pleasure, does not maintain the present.\nThe slave is the truth of the master because he maintains the present\nthrough his relation to work, his deferred consumption of the present.\nThus he is also the embodiment of the dialectical \u201cmemory\u201d\u2014\nErinnerung.

To attempt to reintroduce a purity into the concept of difference, one\nreturns it to nondifference and full presence. This movement is\nfraught with consequences for any attempt opposing itself to an\nindicative anti-Hegelianism. One escapes from it, apparently, only by\nconceiving difference outside the determination of Being as presence,\noutside the alternatives of presence and absence and everything they\ngovern, and only by conceiving difference as original impurity, that is\nto say as diff\u00e9rance in the \ufb01nite economy of the same.\n21.

In a bibliography which was to accom-\npany an unpublished Th\u00e9orie de la religion, one can read this in particu-\nlar: \u201cThis work (Introduction to the Reading of Hegel by Koj\u00e8ve) is an\nexplication of The Phenomenology of the Mind.

In the Phenomenology of\nthe Mind, pursuing this dialectic of the master (the lord, the sovereign)\nand the slave (the man subjugated to work), which is at the origin of\nthe Communist theory of class struggle, Hegel brings the slave to\ntriumph, but his apparent sovereignty is then only the autonomous\nwill of servitude; for its part, sovereignty has only the kingdom of\nfailure\u201d (Genet, in La litt\u00e9rature et le mal).\n25. TN. Erinnerung is the Hegelian, speculative concept of interiorizing\nmemory. Like Aufhebung (cf. note 13 above) it leaves nothing behind.\nRecognition is the Hegelian category which governs the dialectic of\nmaster and slave: it is the master\u2019s \ufb01nal recognition of his truth in the\nslave that permits the Aufhebung, the master\u2019s interiorizing of the\nslave, which produces the freedom of self-consciousness. If the mas-\nter interiorizes servility through speculative concepts, sovereignty\nmust actively forget these concepts; and it must not seek recognition,\nas does the master, for this inevitably leads to servility.\n26. TN. For Plato, Socrates\u2019 stature is summarized by the fact that his\ninstruction was oral, that he did not write. And Plato always attacks the\nSophists, the professional writers, because they make speech\ninauthentic. Cf. \u201cLa pharmacie de Platon,\u201d in La diss\u00e9mination, pp. 120ff.\n27. Taken outside their general syntax, their writing, certain propositions,\nin effect, manifest voluntarism, an entire philosophy of the operating\nactivity of a subject. Sovereignty is a practical operation (cf., for\nexample, the Conf\u00e9rences sur le non-savoir, p. 14). But one would not\nread Bataille\u2019s text if one did not weave these propositions into the\ngeneral warp that undoes them by linking them to, or by inscribing\nthem within, themselves. Thus, a page further on: \u201cAnd it does not\neven suf\ufb01ce to say: one cannot speak of the sovereign moment with-\nout altering it, without altering it insofar as it is truly sovereign. To the\nsame extent as to speak of it, to seek these movements is contradict-\nory. At the moment when we seek something, whatever it is, we do not\nlive in sovereign fashion, we subordinate the present moment to a\nfuture moment that will follow it. Perhaps we attain the sovereign\nmoment following our effort, and, in effect, it is possible that an effort\nis necessary, but between the time of the effort and sovereign time\nthere is necessarily a cut-off, and, one could even say, an abyss.\u201d\nnotes to pages 333\u201338\n438\n"

Sartre\u2019s study, cited above, joints its \ufb01rst and second parts with the\nhinge of this proposition: \u201cBut form is not everything: let us look at the\ncontent\u201d (Situations I, p. 142).\n29. \u201cA dislodging, but aware use of words,\u201d says Sollers (\u201cDe grandes\nirr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s de langage,\u201d Critique, 195\u201396).\n30. One of the essential themes of Sartre\u2019s study (Un nouveau mystique) is\nalso the accusation of scientism, joined with that of mysticism. (\u201cSci-\nentism also will falsify M. Bataille\u2019s entire thought,\u201d p. 147).\n31. Unknowledge is historical, as Sartre notes (\u201cUnknowledge is essen-\ntially historical, since it can be designated only as a certain experience\nthat a certain man had at a certain date,\u201d p. 140), only on its dis-\ncursive, economical, subordinated side, which can be seen and, more\nprecisely, can be designated only within the reassuring closure of know-\nledge. The \u201cedifying narrative\u201d\u2014this is how Sartre quali\ufb01es interior\nexperience immediately afterward\u2014is, on the contrary, on the side of\nknowledge, history, and meaning.\n32. On the operation which consists in miming absolute knowledge, at\nwhose termination \u201cunknowledge having been attained, absolute\nknowledge becomes one kind of knowledge among others,\u201d cf. pp.\n73ff. and 138ff. of EI, where important developments are devoted to the\nCartesian model (\u201ca solid base on which everything rests\u201d) and the\nHegelian model (\u201ccircularity\u201d) of knowledge.\n33. One would commit a gross error in interpreting these propositions in\na \u201creactionary\u201d sense. The consumption of the excess of energy by a\ndetermined class is not the destructive consuming of meaning, but\nthe signi\ufb01cative reappropriation of a surplus value within the space of\nrestricted economy. From this point of view, sovereignty is absolutely\nrevolutionary. But it is also revolutionary as concerns a revolution\nwhich would only reorganize the world of work and would redistribute\nvalues within the space of meaning, that is to say, still within restricted\neconomy. This last movement\u2014only slightly perceived, here and\nthere, by Bataille (for example, in La part maudite. when he evokes the\n\u201cradicalism of Marx\u201d and the \u201crevolutionary sense that Marx formu-\nlated in a sovereign way\u201d) and most often muddled by conjectural\napproximations (for example in the \ufb01fth part of La part maudite)\u2014is\nrigorously necessary, but as a phase within the strategy of general\neconomy.\n34. The writing of sovereignty is neither true nor false, neither truthful nor\ninsincere. It is purely \ufb01ctive in a sense of this word that the classical\noppositions of true and false, essence and appearance, lack. It\nnotes to pages 338\u201342 439\n"

Now, Bataille demonstrates that\nthe \u201cmajor positions\u201d of sovereignty, as much as the minor ones, can\nbe inserted into the sphere of activity\u201d (M\u00e9thode).\nThe difference between the major and the minor is therefore only\nanalogous to the difference between the archaic and the classic. And\nneither the one nor the other must be understood in a classic or minor\nfashion. The archaic is not the originary or the authentic, as they are\ndetermined by philosophical discourse. The major is not opposed to\nthe minor like big to little, high to low. In \u201cVieille taupe\u201d (Old Mole),\n(an unpublished article, rejected by Bifurs), the oppositions of high to\nlow, and of all the signi\ufb01cations in sur-, super- (surreal, superman) and\nin sub- (subterranean, etc.), of the imperialist eagle and the proletarian\nmole, are examined in all the possibilities of their reversals.\n40. \u201cPlay is nothing if not an open and unreserved challenge to everything\nopposed to play\u201d (marginal note in the unpublished \u201cTh\u00e9orie de la\nreligion,\u201d which Bataille also planned to entitle \u201cTo die laughing and to\nlaugh at dying\u201d).\n41. \u201cA gesture . . . irreducible to classical logic . . . and for which no logic\nseems to be constituted\u201d says Sollers in Le toit, which begins by\nunmasking, in their systematicity, all the forms of pseudotransgression,\nthe social and historical \ufb01gurations in which can be read the complicity\nbetween \u201cthe man who lives without protest under the yoke of the law,\nand the man for whom the law is nothing.\u201d In this last case, repression\nis only \u201credoubled\u201d (Le toit: Essai de lecture syst\u00e9matique, in Logiques\n[Paris: Seuil, 1968], p. 168).\n42. Like every discourse, like Hegel\u2019s, Bataille\u2019s discourse has the form of\na structure of interpretations. Each proposition, which is already\ninterpretive in nature, can be interpreted by another proposition.\nTherefore, if we proceed prudently and all the while remain in Bataille\u2019s\ntext, we can detach an interpretation from its reinterpretation and\nsubmit it to another interpretation bound to other propositions of the\nsystem. Which, without interrupting general systematicity, amounts to\nrecognizing the strong and weak moments in the interpretation of a\nbody of thought by itself, these differences of force keeping to the\nnotes to pages 345\u201348 441\n"

Which nei-\nther frees nor prohibits us from determining the rules of force and of\nweakness: which are always a function of: (1) the distance from the\nmoment of sovereignty; (2) the misconstruing of the rigorous norms\nof knowledge.\nThe greatest force is the force of a writing which, in the most\naudacious transgression, continues to maintain and to acknowledge\nthe necessity of the system of prohibitions (knowledge, science, phil-\nosophy, work, history, etc.). Writing is always traced between these two\nsides of the limit.\nAmong the weak moments of Bataille\u2019s discourse, certain ones are\nsignaled by the determined unknowledge which is a certain philo-\nsophical ignorance.
