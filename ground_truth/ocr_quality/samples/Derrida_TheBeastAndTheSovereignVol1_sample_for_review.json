From early in his career, in 1968, and annually thereafter un-\ntil 2003, Derrida regularly taught at U.S. universities. It was his custom to \nrepeat for his American audience the lectures delivered to his students in \nFrance the same year. Teaching \ufb01 rst at Johns Hopkins and then at Yale, \nhe read the lectures in French as they had been written. But from 1987, \nwhen he began teaching at the University of California, Irvine, Derrida \nundertook to lecture in En glish, improvising on-the-spot translations of his \nFrench text. Recognizing that the greater part of his audience outside of \nFrance depended on translation was easier, however, than providing an ad \nlibitum En glish version of his own elegant, complex, and idiomatic writ-\ning. In the circumstance, to his evident joy in teaching was often added a \nmeasure of suffering and regret for all that remained behind in the French \noriginal. It is to the memory of Derrida the teacher as well as to all his stu-\ndents past and still to come that we offer these En glish translations of \u201cThe \nSeminars of Jacques Derrida.\u201d\nThe volumes in this series are translations of the original French editions \npublished by \u00c9ditions Galil\u00e9e, Paris, and will in each case follow shortly the \npublication of the corresponding French volume. The scope of the project, \nand the basic editorial principles followed in establishing the text, are out-\nlined in the \u201cGeneral Introduction to the French Edition,\u201d translated here. \nEditorial issues and decisions relating more speci\ufb01 cally to this volume are \naddressed in an \u201cEditorial Note.\u201d Editors\u2019 footnotes and other editorial inter-\nventions are, with a few exceptions, translated without modi\ufb01 cation, ex cept \nin the case of footnoted citations of quoted material, which refer to extant \nEn glish translations of the source as necessary.

Fi-\nnally \u2014 and, no doubt, most relevantly for the editorial work \u2014 according \nto the tools used: we have handwritten sessions from 1960 to 1970; type-\nscripts, with manuscript annotations and corrections, from 1970 to 1988; \nelectronic \ufb01 les and printouts from 1988 to 2003.\nDerrida\u2019s seminars, which already had their own style and had already \n attracted a broad and numerous following at the rue d\u2019Ulm (where the \nchoice of subjects and authors, if not the way they were treated, was con-\nstrained by the program of the Agr\u00e9gation),2 take on their de\ufb01 nitive char-\nacter at the EHESS, where, on Wednesdays from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm, a \ndozen times a year, Jacques Derrida, sometimes improvising a little, would \nread before a large audience the text of his seminar, entirely written out for \neach session as the year proceeded. (Add to that a few improvised sessions, \nsometimes around a reading, and a few discussion sessions.) Henceforth \nfree in his choice of subjects, Derrida launched research projects over peri-\nods of several years, which link together in explicit, coherent, and gripping \nfashion. The great question of philosophical nationality and nationalism \n(1984\u201388) leads to that of the \u201cPolitics of Friendship\u201d (1988\u201391), and then to \nthe long series of \u201cQuestions of Responsibility\u201d (1991\u2013 2003), focusing suc-\ncessively on the Secret (1991\u201392), on Testimony (1992\u201395), Hostility and \nHospitality (1995\u201397), Perjury and Pardon (1997\u201399), and the Death Pen-\nalty (1999\u20132001), with the \ufb01 nal two years devoted to \u201cThe Beast and the \nSovereign\u201d (2001\u20133).\nJacques Derrida was in the habit of drawing on the abundant mate-\nrial of these seminars for the very numerous lectures he gave every year \nthroughout the world, and often, via this route, parts of the seminars were \nreworked and published. Several of his books also \ufb01 nd their point of de-\nparture in the work of the seminar: Of Grammatology (1967), for example, \nin large part develops sessions of the 1965\u201366 seminar on \u201cNature, Culture, \nWriting\u201d; the seminar on \u201cHegel\u2019s Family\u201d (1971\u201372) is picked up in Glas \n(1974). Politics of Friendship (1994) is explicitly presented as the expansion of \nthe \ufb01 rst session of the 1988\u201389 seminar, and there are traces in it of other \nsessions too. But in spite of these partial convergences and correspondences, \nin En glish: Derrida would improvise during the session an En glish version of his text, \nwhich he had previously annotated for this purpose. \n2.

Rather than \nattempt what could only be a reductive summary, we reproduce here the \npresentation given by Derrida in the \u00c9cole\u2019s yearbook:\nWe pursued the research that in previous years, centering on the prob-\nlem of the death penalty, had led us to study sovereignty, the political and \nontotheological history of its concept and its \ufb01 gures. This year we delib-\nerately privileged what intertwined this history with that of a thinking \nof the living being (the biological and the zoological), and more precisely \nwith the treatment of so- called animal life in all its registers (hunting and \ndomestication, political history of zoological parks and gardens, breeding, \nindustrial and experimental exploitation of the living animal, \ufb01 gures of \nbestiality and b\u00eatise, etc.). The point was not merely to study, from Aristo-\ntle to contemporary discussions (Foucault, Agamben), the canonical texts \naround the interpretation of man as a \u201cpolitical animal.\u201d We had above all \nto explore the \u201clogics\u201d organizing both the submission of the beast (and \nthe living being) to political sovereignty, and an irresistible and overloaded \nanalogy between a beast and a sovereign supposed to share a space of some \nexteriority with respect to \u201claw\u201d and \u201cright\u201d (outside the law: above the law: \norigin and foundation of the law).\n \nWe studied a great many philosophical, rhetorical, political, and other \nindices of this overdetermined analogy (La Fontaine\u2019s Fables and the tradi-\ntion that precedes and follows them, texts by Machiavelli, Schmitt, etc.). We \nalso attempted a sort of taxonomy of the animal \ufb01 gures of the political, no-\ntably from the point of view of sovereignty (always outside the law: above \nthe laws). Alongside the lion, the fox, etc., the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the wolf (in \nmany cultures) and often the \u201cwerewolf\u201d (in Europe) interested us a great \ndeal, from Plautus to Hobbes and Rousseau.\n \nOn the permanent horizon of our work were general questions about \ne d i t o r i a l  n o t e\n14\n"

Also, Derrida often left time for discussion with seminar participants. \nWe have signaled such moments in the sessions, but we also decided not to \ninclude these discussions, which, although they were recorded (but often in \na technically de\ufb01 cient manner, with some voices being inaudible and above \nall dif\ufb01 cult to identify), seemed to us to raise too many questions. In this we \nhave followed what was most usually done at the Cerisy and other major \nconferences devoted to Derrida\u2019s work.\nIn the typescript of the seminar, the bibliographical indications were, \nmost often, clearly indicated but in abbreviated form: we have completed \nthem and \ufb01 lled in those that were missing. A number of quotations were \nnot copied out in the typescript: they were included as photocopies of pages \nfrom books, and we have reinserted them, where necessary resorting to the \ntape recording of the sessions to be sure of where to begin and end. Else-\nwhere, we used Jacques Derrida\u2019s own books, whenever it was possible to \n\ufb01 nd them in the library of his house at Ris- Orangis. In doubtful cases or \nwhere it was impossible to track down the copy he would have used, we \nhave referred to the editions that are generally thought to be the most reli-\nable. We have checked and where necessary corrected the quotations made \nby Jacques Derrida, rectifying without signaling the fact whatever seemed \nto be obvious errors of transcription; but we have signaled, when they \nmight be signi\ufb01 cant, certain modi\ufb01 cations to quotations or translations. Fi-\nnally, to end on this question of references: Jacques Derrida makes numer-\nous references throughout the seminar to his own earlier work, whether \npublished or not: we give references whenever the citation is explicit, even \nwhen the work cited belongs to the still unpublished body of the seminars \nthemselves.7\nAs for the more technical aspects of our work, they are relatively slight. \nThis edition is of the entire text of Derrida\u2019s 2001\u20132 seminar as it was com-\nposed and laid out by him, notably as to its sometimes very long sentences \nand paragraphs. Similarly, at a more micrographic level, the punctuation \nhas been preserved; in particular all the brackets, which are Derrida\u2019s own.8 \nWe have, however, on rare occasions made some corrections or minute al-\n7.

It is looming, an object of apprehension; it is named, re-\nferred to, even called by its name; one imagines it or projects toward it an \nimage, a trope, a \ufb01 gure, a myth, a fable, a fantasy, but always by reference to \nsomeone who, advancing \u00e0 pas de loup, is not there, not yet there, someone \nwho is not yet present or represented; you can\u2019t even see its tail; as another \nproverb says: \u201cWhen you speak of the wolf, you see its tail,\u201d meaning that \nsomeone, a human this time, shows up just when you are talking about him \nor her.

An adverb haunts a noun. The adverb pas has \nslipped in silently, stealthy as a wolf, \u00e0 pas de loup, into the noun pas [step].\nWhich is to say that where things are looming \u00e0 pas de loup, the wolf is \nnot there yet, no real wolf, no so- called natural wolf, no literal wolf. There \nis no wolf yet when things are looming \u00e0 pas de loup. There is only a word, a \nspoken word, a fable, a  fable- wolf, a fabulous animal, or even a fantasy (fan-\ntasma in the sense of a revenant, in Greek; or fantasy in the enigmatic sense \nof psychoanalysis, in the sense, for example, that a totem corresponds to a \nfantasy); there is only another \u201cwolf\u201d that \ufb01 gures something else \u2014 some-\nthing or somebody else, the other that the fabulous \ufb01 gure of the wolf, like \n8.

Although the path \nwe\u2019re going down is not exactly the same, we\u2019ll often be crossing this anal-\nysis of Marin\u2019s, which I therefore strongly recommend that you read. One \nof the many interesting things about Marin\u2019s approach is that it proposes a \nhistorical articulation between several exactly contemporary texts: this fable \nof La Fontaine\u2019s, then the Port- Royal General Grammar and Art of Think-\ning, and \ufb01 nally a famous Pens\u00e9e of Pascal\u2019s on the relation between justice \nand force, a Pens\u00e9e to which Marin often returned, and the logic of which \nis very important to us here.

It is just that what is just be followed; it is necessary that what \nis strongest be followed. Justice without force is impotent; force without \njustice is tyrannical. Justice without force is contradicted, because there are \nalways bad people; force without justice stands accused. So justice and force \nmust be put together; and to do so make what is just, strong and what is \nstrong, just.\n \nJustice is subject to dispute; force is easy to recognize and indisputable. \nAnd so one could not give force to justice, because force contradicted justice \nand said that it was unjust, and said that it was force that was just. And \nthus not being able to make what is just, strong; one made what is strong, \njust.12\nApart from Marin\u2019s, I refer you, among the texts that are one way or \nan other devoted to this fragment, to my little book Force de loi13 and the \nremarkable chapter that Geoffrey Bennington devotes to Paul de Man in \nLegislations: The Politics of Deconstruction.14\n11.

This time in the syntagm \n\u201cavoir raison\u201d the point is not to avoir raison de but just to avoir raison, to \nbe just or right]; but he took the effect for the cause. Any man born into \nslavery is born for slavery, nothing is more certain. Slaves lose everything in \ntheir irons, even the desire to be free of them; they love their enslavement \nas Odysseus\u2019s companions loved their brutishness. So if there are slaves by \nnature, this is because there have been slaves against nature. Force made the \n\ufb01 rst slaves.19\nRousseau\u2019s thesis is thus both that \u201cthe reason of the strongest\u201d is in fact the \nbest, that it has prevailed and prevails in fact (the stronger has reason of the \nweaker, the wolf of the lamb), but that if in fact the reason of the stronger \nwins out, by right the reason of the strongest is not the best, ought not to be, \nought not to have been the best, ought not to have been right, and every-\nthing will turn around the semantic pivot of the word \u201creason\u201d in the fable: \nwhen the fable says \u201cthe reason of the strongest is always the best,\u201d is it rea-\nson itself, the good reason, the most just reason, true reason, or the reason \ngiven, alleged by the stronger (Caligula or the sovereign or the wolf in the \nfable) which is the best? And \u201cbest\u201d can still mean two radically hetero -\n19. Ibid., p. 237. This last sentence of Rousseau ends thus: \u201cForce made the \ufb01 rst \nslaves, their cowardice perpetuated their slavery.\u201d \n34 \n"

For the current representation, to which \nwe are referring for a start, sovereign and beast seem to have in common \ntheir  being- outside- the- law. It is as though both of them were situated by \nde\ufb01 nition at a distance from or above the laws, in nonrespect for the abso-\nlute law, the absolute law that they make or that they are but that they do \nnot have to respect.

But if Saddam\u2019s Iraq indeed \ncomes in at the top of the list of criminal states, if, as US diplomacy has been \nreminding us regularly for ten years, Saddam is guilty of using weapons of \nmass destruction against his neighbors and his own people, Chomsky has no \ndif\ufb01 culty recalling that for a very long time Saddam was well treated by the \nUSA, as an ally and a client. This treatment only came to an end, leading to \na terrible biological war whose Iraqi victims are counted by the thousands \n(malnutrition, illness, \ufb01 ve thousand children dying every month accord-\ning to unicef quoted by Chomsky, etc.) \u2014 this treatment of Saddam as \nrespected ally and client only came to an end, then, when Saddam stopped \nfollowing the political and  militaro- economic strategy of the USA (and one \ncould say the same about the Taliban). Only at that moment did Iraq, ceas-\ning to be an ally, an accomplice, or a docile client, become a rogue state and \nonly then did one begin to speak of Saddam Hussein, the leader of a rogue \nstate, as a beast, \u201cthe beast of Baghdad.\u201d29 I make this remark to announce \nthe fact that we will no doubt be talking a lot, later in this seminar, about \nwhat has become known as \u201cSeptember 11.\u201d\nThat, said too brie\ufb02 y and in pure anticipation, is the obscure place to-\nward which we are directed by the word, itself obscure, \u201canalogy,\u201d analogy \nbetween the political sovereign and the beast. This word analogy is not only \nobscure, like a word whose concept or theorem, whose theoretical tenor, is \ninvisible or inaccessible: it is obscure and dark and black, this word analogy, \nlike the reality of a frightening cloud that announces and carries within \nit the threat of thunder, of lightning, of tempest and hurricane; it is dark \nbecause it is heavy with all the (actual and virtual) violences and nameless \nhistorical ravages, disasters we won\u2019t (already don\u2019t) have a name for, when \nthe names of right (national or international), war, civil war or international \nwar, terrorism (national or international) lose their most elementary credit.\n2. The second reason why I quote these \ufb01 rst chapters of the Social Con-\ntract is that we already see cited in them philosophers and philosophemes, \npolitical philosophies, that ought to occupy us as a \ufb01 rst priority: for example, \nas you heard, Aristotle, Grotius, and Hobbes. Rousseau here inscribes all \nthree of them rather quickly into the same tradition, neglecting the massive \nfact that it was in order to break with Aristotle, and with the consequences \n29.

Naturally we shall have to read or reread these texts.\n3. The third reason why I refer to these \ufb01 rst chapters of the Social Con-\ntract is that in the lines I have just quoted, Rousseau adds a footnote to the \nword \u201cbrutishness\u201d [abrutissement] (\u201cthey love their enslavement as Odys-\nseus\u2019s companions loved their brutishness\u201d). The note refers to Plutarch. It \nsays, \u201cSee a little treatise by Plutarch, entitled: That Beasts Have Reason.\u201d \nYou will \ufb01 nd this fascinating text by Plutarch [Bruta Animalia ratione uti], \ntranslated [into French] by Amyot, in the collection published and pref-\naced by \u00c9lisabeth de Fontenay, Trois trait\u00e9s pour les animaux.30 The treatise \nto which Rousseau refers is found there under the title \u201cThat brute beasts \nuse reason.\u201d The word \u201cbrute\u201d will often be very important to us, where it \nseems to connote not only animality but a certain bestiality of the animal. \nI cannot recommend too strongly that you read these texts, which could \ndetain us for a long time. In \u201cThat brute beasts use reason,\u201d the \ufb01 rst words \nof a philosophical discussion with several voices already or again convoke \nthe \ufb01 gure of the wolf, the analogy and the quasi- metamorphosis that or-\nganizes the passage between man and wolf (but also lion). The discussion \nbegins, then, with this metamorphic analogy: \u201cI think I\u2019ve understood what \nyou\u2019re saying, Circe, and I\u2019ll bear it in mind. But please could you tell me \nwhether there are any Greeks among the people you\u2019ve turned into wolves \nand lions?\u201d31\nRead what follows and notice too that in praising a certain virtue of the \nanimal, one of the participants in the discussion, Gryllus, places, precisely, \nthis animal virtue above or at a distance from the law. Let me read this ethi-\ncal and political praise of the animal, whose moral and social, even political, \nvirtue goes above or before the law \u2014 a bit like (a \u201clike\u201d that carries the \nwhole charge of the question of an analogy), a bit \u201clike\u201d the sovereign:\nYou can see, however, that when animals \ufb01 ght with one another or with \nyou humans, they do not employ tricks and stratagems: they rely in their \nbattles on blatant bare bravery backed up by real prowess. They don\u2019t need \na law to be passed [my emphasis] to summon them to battle, and they don\u2019t \n\ufb01 ght because they\u2019re afraid of being  court- martialled for desertion: they see \n30.

Might its force, its power, its greatest \nforce, its absolute potency be, in essence and always in the last instance, a \npower of devourment (mouth, teeth, tongue, violent rush to bite, engulf, \nswallow the other, to take the other into oneself too, to kill it or mourn it)? \nBut what goes via interiorizing devourment, i.e. via orality, via the mouth, \nthe maw, teeth, throat, glottis, and tongue \u2014 which are also the sites of cry \nand speech, of language \u2014 that very thing can also inhabit that other site of \nthe visage or the face, i.e. the ears, the auricular attributes, the visible and \ntherefore audiovisual forms of what allows one not only to speak but also \nto hear and listen. \u201cGrandmother, what big ears you have,\u201d she says to the \nwolf. The place of devourment is also the place of what carries the voice, \nthe topos of the  porte- voix [megaphone, literally \u201cvoice- carrier\u201d], in a word, \nthe place of vociferation. Devourment, vociferation, there, in the \ufb01 gure of \nthe \ufb01 gure,35 in the face, smack in the mouth, but also in the \ufb01 gure as trope, \nthere\u2019s the \ufb01 gure of \ufb01 gure, vociferating devourment or devouring vocifera-\ntion. The one, vociferation, exteriorizes what is eaten, devoured, or interior-\nized: the other, conversely or simultaneously, i.e. devourment, interiorizes \nwhat is exteriorized or proffered. And on this subject of devouring, proffer-\ning, eating, speaking, and therefore listening, of obeying in receiving within \nthrough the ears, on the subject of the beast and the sovereign, I leave you \nto muse on the ass\u2019s ears of King Midas that Apollo in\ufb02 icted on him because \nhe had preferred his rival in a musical competition. The ass is thought, un-\nfairly, to be the most stupid of beasts [la plus b\u00eate des b\u00eates]. Midas hid these \nass\u2019s ears under his crown, and when his hairdresser denounced him and \ndivulged his secret to the earth, the rushes, Ovid tells us, murmured in the \nwind, \u201cKing Midas has ass\u2019s ears!\u201d And then in Tristan and Yseult, another \nking, another animal\u2019s ears, the horse\u2019s ears of King Mark.\n35.

Nature is the art of God when he creates and governs the world, \ni.e. when, by an art of life, a genius of life, he produces the living and thus \ncommands the living. Well, man, who is the most eminent living creation \nof God, the art of man that is the most excellent replica of the art of God, \nthe art of this living being, man, imitates the art of God but, being unable to \ncreate, fabricates and, being unable to engender a natural animal, fabricates \nan arti\ufb01 cial animal.

For by art is created that great leviathan, called a common-\n wealth or state, (in latine civitas) which is but an Arti\ufb01 ciall Man; though \nof greater stature and strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and \ndefence it was intended; and in which, the Soveraignty is an Arti\ufb01 ciall Soul, \nas giving life and motion to the whole body; The Magistrates, and other Of-\n\ufb01 cers of Judicature and Execution, arti\ufb01 ciall Joynts; Reward and Punishment \n(by which fastned to the seate of the Soveraignty, every joint and member is \nmoved to performe his duty) are the Nerves.\nLet me interrupt the quotation for a moment to emphasize two points. On \nthe one hand, sovereignty is the arti\ufb01 cial soul: the soul, i.e. the principle of \nlife, life, vitality, vivacity of this Leviathan, and so also of the state, of this \nstate monster created and dominated by the art of man, arti\ufb01 cial animal \nmonster which is none other than arti\ufb01 cial man, says Hobbes, and which \nlives as a republic, state, commonwealth, civitas only through this sover-\neignty. This sovereignty is like an iron lung, an arti\ufb01 cial respiration, an \n\u201cArti\ufb01 ciall Soul.\u201d So the state is a sort of robot, an animal monster, which, in \nthe \ufb01 gure of man, or of man in the \ufb01 gure of the animal monster, is stronger, \netc., than natural man. Like a gigantic prosthesis designed to amplify, by \nobjectifying it outside natural man, to amplify the power of the living, the \nliving man that it protects, that it serves, but like a dead machine, or even \na machine of death, a machine which is only the mask of the living, like a \nmachine of death can serve the living. But this state and prosthetic machine, \nlet\u2019s say prosthstatic, this prosthstate must also extend, mime, imitate, even \nreproduce down to the details the living creature that produces it. Which \nmeans that, paradoxically, this political discourse of Hobbes\u2019s is vitalist, or-\nganicist, \ufb01 nalist, and mechanicist. Right down to the detail, the analogistic \ndescription of the Leviathan follows in the body of the state, the Repub-\nlic, the Civitas, the Commonwealth, the whole structure of the human body. \nFor example, the nerves are the penal law, the reward and punishment by \nwhich, says Hobbes, sovereignty, fastening to its service each articulation \nand each member, puts them in motion in order to ful\ufb01 ll their duty. So it is \nwhen talking about penal law that Hobbes, in this physiology of the politi-\ncal, names a sovereignty that is, therefore, the nerve or nervous system of \nthe body politic, which both ensures its articulation and sets it into motion. \nWealth and riches are the state\u2019s strength, the salus populi, or safety, is the \nstate\u2019s business, the counselors are its memory, concord is its health, sedition is \nits illness, and \ufb01 nally, a point to which we shall return often, civil war is its \ndeath. Civil war is the death of the Leviathan, the death of the state, and that \nat bottom is the subject of our seminar: What is a war, today, how can we \n \n53\n \n54\n"

This right of man over the beasts is demonstrated in \nchapter 8 [of the De Cive], \u201cOf the right of Masters over slaves,\u201d just before \nchapter 9, \u201cOf the right of parents over children and on the Patrimonial \nKingdom,\u201d during which sovereignty, domination, or sovereign power is \nsaid to be indivisible (a feature to which we shall return constantly); and \nHobbes demonstrates that this sovereignty, within the family, belongs to \nthe father who is, I quote, \u201ca little king in his house\u201d [\u201cun petit roi dans sa \nmaison\u201d],42 and not to the mother, although by natural generation, in the \nstate of nature, in which, following Hobbes, \u201cit cannot be known who is a \nchild\u2019s father\u201d (an old and tenacious prejudice), it is the mother, the only cer-\ntain generatrix, who controls the child; when one leaves the state of nature \nthrough the civil contract, it is the father who, in a \u201ccivill government,\u201d has \nat his disposal authority and power. And so just before treating \u201cOf the right \nof parents over children and on the Patrimonial Kingdom\u201d (and therefore \nthe absolute right of the father in civil society), at the end of chapter 8, entitled \n\u201cOf the right of Masters over slaves,\u201d Hobbes posits the right of man over \nthe beasts.

The word \u201csubjection,\u201d the gesture of \u201csubduing\u201d is \nat the center of the last paragraph of chapter 8, on the right of the master \nover the slaves, which I\u2019ll read to conclude for today:\nRight over non- rational animals is acquired in the same way as over the \npersons of men, that is, by natural strength and powers. In the natural state, \nbecause of the war of all against all, any one may legitimately subdue or \neven kill Men, whenever that seems to be to his advantage; much more \nwill this be the case against animals. That is, one may at discretion reduce \nto one\u2019s service any animals that can be tamed or made useful, and wage \ncontinual war against the rest as harmful, and hunt them down and kill \nthem. Thus Dominion over animals has its origin in the right of nature not \nin Divine positive right. For if no such right had existed before the publi-\ncation of holy scripture, no one could rightly have slaughtered animals \nfor food except someone to whom the divine will had been revealed in \nthe holy scriptures; and the condition of mankind would surely have been \nvery hard, since the beasts could devour them in all innocence, while they \ncould not devour the beasts. Since therefore it is by natural right that an \nanimal kills a man, it will be by the same right that a man slaughters an \nanimal.43\nConclusion: the beast and [et] the sovereign (couple, coupling, copula), the \nbeast is [est] the sovereign, man is the beast for man, homo homini lupus, Pe-\nter and the wolf, Peter accompanies his grandfather on the wolf hunt, Peter, \nthe grandfather and the wolf, the father is the wolf.\nIn \u201cThe Question of Lay Analysis\u201d (Die Frage der Laienanalyse, 1926), \nFreud pretends to be in dialogue, as you know, with an impartial person, \nand he reminds him that every time a ravenous animal (\u201clike the wolf,\u201d says \nFreud) enters the scene in a story, \u201cwe shall recognize as a disguise of the \nfather.\u201d44 And Freud explains that we cannot account for these fables and \nmyths without returning to infantile sexuality.

The animals are related \nto us, they are even our brothers, says one French translation,46 they are our \nkin, and there are even animal states, but we humans would not be happy \nin them, says Freud in sum. Why? The hypothesis he leaves hanging is \nthat these states are arrested in their history. They have no history and no \nfuture; and the reason for this arrest, this stabilization, this stasis (and in \nthis sense animal states seems more stable and therefore more statelike than \nhuman states), the reason for their relatively  a-historical stasis is a relative \nequilibrium between the environment and their drives. Whereas for man \n(this is the hypothesis that Freud leaves hanging), it is possible that an excess \nor relaunching of libido might have provoked a new rebellion on the part \nof the destructive drive, a new unleashing of the death drive and of cruelty, \nand therefore a relaunching (be it \ufb01 nite or in\ufb01 nite) of history. That is the \nquestion that Freud leaves open for us. (Read Freud, Civilization and Its \nDiscontents, p. 123.)\nWhy do our relatives, the animals, not exhibit any such cultural struggle? \nWe do not know. Very probably some of them \u2014 the bees, the ants, the ter-\nmites \u2014 strove for thousands of years before they arrived at the State institu-\ntions, the distribution of functions and the restrictions on the individual, for \nwhich we admire them to- day. It is a mark of our present condition that we \nknow from our own feelings that we should not think ourselves happy in any \nof these animal States or in any of the roles assigned in them to the individual. \nIn the case of other animal species it may be that a temporary balance has \nbeen reached between the in\ufb02 uences of their environment and the mutually \ncontending instincts within them, and that thus a cessation of development \nhas come about. It may be that in primitive man a fresh access of libido kin-\ndled a renewed burst of activity on the part of the destructive instinct.

It gives something to be known, it dispenses knowledge, and \nknowledge must be without fable. And you must make known without \nfable. Similarly, in the prevalent or hegemonic tradition of the political, a \npolitical discourse, and above all a political action, should in no case come \nunder the category of the fabular, of that type of simulacrum called fabular, \nthat type of speech known as the fable, be it the fable in general, or the fable \nas determinate literary genre in the European West.

So that everything comes down to fear: \nI can commit a crime and exert terror by fear, but it is the same fear that \nmakes me obey the law. Fear is \u201csometimes cause of Crime, as when the \ndanger is neither present, nor corporeall\u201d (p. 150). This is an important pre-\ncision: Hobbes privileges \u201cBodily Fear\u201d and the \u201cpresent\u201d of the body, but \nthere is in all fear something that refers, essentially, to non- body and non-\n present, if only the future of a threat: what causes fear is never fully present \nnor fully corporeal, in the sense that the purely corporeal is supposed to be \nsaturated with presence. Fear always exceeds corporeal presence, and this is \nwhy it is also the passion correlative to the law; fear is thus both the origin of \nthe law and of the transgression of the law, the origin of both law and crime. \nAnd if you take fear to the limit of the threat either exerted or felt, i.e. ter-\nror, then you have to conclude that terror is both what motivates respect for \nlaws and the transgression of laws. If you translate \u201claw\u201d by \u201csovereignty\u201d \nand \u201cstate,\u201d you have to conclude that terror is equally opposed to the state \nas a challenge as it is exerted by the state as the essential manifestation of \nits sovereignty. Whence Hobbes\u2019s measured statements\u2014I mean measured \ninto more and less, more or less. There is, at bottom, only fear, fear has no \nopposite, it is coextensive with the whole \ufb01 eld of the passions, and here with \npolitical passion. The political subject is primarily subjected to fear, and it \nis fear that is sometimes the most propitious, sometimes the least propitious, \nbut one cannot not count on it and with it. And fear is primarily fear for \nthe body, for the body proper, for one\u2019s own proper body, i.e. for life. Life \nlives in fear. Life is essentially fearful, fear is the passion of life, etc. \u201cOf all \nPassions, that which enclineth men least to break the Lawes, is Fear.\u201d (Note \nthe strange  logico- grammatical turn of this de\ufb01 nition. Hobbes does not say \nthat fear drives one to obey the laws, more than any other passion; he says \nthat among the passions that incline men to crime, felony, transgression of \nthe law\u2014with the implication that they all do, fear included because he will \nsay at the end of this paragraph that one can commit crime through fear\u2014\namong all the passions that incline humans to crime, felony, transgression \nof the law, fear as passion, as affect, is the one that does so least. And then \nhe will take things the other way around, and examine the other side of the \nsame assertion, from the side not of the transgression but the keeping of \nthe laws; if fear is a passion that is less inclined, less propitious to the infrac-\ntion of the laws, then it is the most propitious, and even the only one that \nis propitious, to their being kept\u2014with the exception, the rare exception \nonly of some \u201cgenerous natures\u201d who can assert the laws without fear, who \ncan preserve the laws or not break them other than by the negative reactiv-\n70 \n71 \n"

And yet in many cases a Crime may be com-\nmitted through Feare\u201d (p. 150).\nWhat is becoming clearer here is that the fear that pushes one to respect \nthe laws and therefore to respect a sovereignty destined, by convention, \nto ensure the protection of the citizens\u2014that this fear is here de\ufb01 ned as a \nhuman thing, as proper to mankind. Hobbes twice speci\ufb01 es this humanity, \nthis properly human quality (\u201cOf all Passions, that which enclineth men \nleast to break the Lawes, is Fear. Nay [. . .] it is the onely thing (when there \nis appearance of pro\ufb01 t, or pleasure by breaking the Lawes,) that makes men \nkeep them\u201d). This humanity, this proper to man here signi\ufb01 es that sover-\neignty, laws, law and therefore the state are nothing natural and are posited \nby contract and convention. They are prostheses. If there is a prosthetic \nstructure to the Leviathan as political animal or monster, this is because \nof its conventional, thetic, contractual structure. The opposition between \nphysis and nomos (nature and law), as opposition between physis and thesis \n(nature and convention, or nature and positing), is here fully and decisively \nfunctional. It follows that law, sovereignty, the institution of the state are \nhistorical and always provisional, let\u2019s say deconstructible, essentially fragile \nor \ufb01 nite or mortal, even if sovereignty is posited as immortal. It is posited as \nimmortal and indivisible precisely because it is mortal and divisible, con-\ntract or convention being destined to ensure for it what it does not have, \nor is not, naturally. So that if sovereignty is, as Hobbes says, the \u201cSoule of \nthe  Common- wealth,\u201d7 this soul is an arti\ufb01 cial, institutional, prosthetic and \nmortal soul: it lasts only as long as law, sovereignty, and the state are able to \nprotect fearful subjects against what is causing them fear. The word protec-\ntion here bears the whole burden of the political, i.e. the insurance contract \nmade between scared or terrorized subjects to delegate to the state or the \nsovereign the charge of protecting them when they cannot protect them-\nselves. They must then obey what protects them. For the fear that pushes \nthem to obey the laws, obedience to the laws, their condition as subject to \nthe law only lasts the time that the sovereign can ensure their protection. \nThis insurance policy [police d\u2019assurance] which basically entrusts to sov-\nereignty the very police [police], the protection of security, comes down to \nmoving from one fear to another. One institutes sovereignty because one is \nfearful (for one\u2019s life, for one\u2019s own body) and therefore because one needs \nto be protected, and then one obeys the law one has instituted through fear \n7.

The Soveraignty is \nthe Soule of the  Common- wealth; which once departed from the Body, the \nmembers doe no more receive their motion from it. The end of Obedience \nis Protection; which, wheresoever a man seeth it, either in his own, or in \nanothers sword, nature applyeth his obedience to it, and his endeavour to \nmaintaine it. And though Soveraignty, in the intention of them that make \nit, be immortall; yet is it in its own nature, not only subject to violent death, \nby forreign war; but also through the ignorance and passions of men, it \nhath in it, from the very institution, many seeds of a naturall mortality, by \nIntestine Discord. (p. 121)\nAs it is for Schmitt, here a good disciple of a Hobbes he often quotes and \nin whom he sees a decisionist theorist of sovereignty, evil is civil war. This \nis what Schmitt says about the great law of protection, which he analyzes \nin utterly historical fashion, i.e. both as historical in the sense of being pro-\nduced by pact, contract, alliance, institution, and as a historical theory, i.e. \n73 \n74 \n"

According to this Covenant, according to this convention designed \nto protect them from each other in peace\u2014protect is the most frequent word \nin these pages, along with convention\u2014they \u201cauthorize\u201d themselves to au-\nthorize all (I repeat: all) the actions and all (I repeat: all) the judgments of \nthe man or assembly of men that the majority of this multitude has given \nthe right to represent them. Even those who voted against are obliged, they \noblige themselves to be obliged to obey unconditionally. And it is during \nthe exposition of everything that is entailed by this unconditional obedience \nto the convention (I leave you to follow this at the beginning of chapter \n18) that Hobbes encounters and rejects the objection that one can place a \nconvention or a commitment above the one that institutes the state. For ex-\nample, a commitment with respect to God. Some people might claim that \nthey are disobeying the human sovereign because they are obeying God, \nwhose sovereignty trumps that of statesmen. As you can imagine, this point \nis a delicate one for those who, like me, often speak of an onto- theologico-\n political structure of sovereignty (to be deconstructed).

But things get complicated, in Bodin as well \nas in Hobbes, and we shall have more than one sign of this: in any case \nin Hobbes, as that\u2019s where we are, it gets complicated by the fact that this \nhumanity, this anthropological essence of prosthstatics is produced, from \nthe opening pages of Leviathan, on the divine model. The arti\ufb01 cial man, \nas Hobbes says, the arti\ufb01 cial soul, the \u201cArti\ufb01 cial Animal\u201d that the Levia-\nthan is, imitates the natural art of God: \u201cnature (the Art whereby God hath \nmade and governes the World) is by the Art of man, as in many other things, \nso in this also imitated, that it can make an Arti\ufb01 cial Animal\u201d (p. 9). These \nare the opening words of Leviathan, we already read them, and the conse-\nquences can be seen constantly and everywhere. And this human mimesis \nproduces automats, machines that mimic the natural life created by God. \nThe life of these automats, of these machines, is compared to that of clocks \nand watches. Why could we not say, Hobbes asks immediately afterward, \nthat all the automata (machines or engines that move by virtue of springs \nand wheels, like a watch) have an arti\ufb01 cial life? In this way, a philosophy \nand even a theology of mimesis grounds in the last analysis the most hu-\nmanist and anthropologist discourse of sovereignty. So that, however dif-\n\ufb01 cult it remains, we must ceaselessly understand how the so- called modern \nhumanist or anthropologist insistence on the speci\ufb01 city of the state or of \nso- called modern political sovereignty gets its irreducible originality, i.e. \nits arti\ufb01 cial, conventional, if you will  techno- prosthstatic nature, only by \ngrounding itself in a profound ontotheology, or even in a religion. If you \nread at least chapter 8 of the \ufb01 rst book of Bodin\u2019s Six Books of the Republic \n(1583; Leviathan dates from 1651), a chapter entitled \u201cOn Sovereignty\u201d (and \nwhich begins by de\ufb01 ning sovereignty, \u201cabsolute and perpetual power of the \nstate\u201d in more than one language\u2014majestas, majestatem in Latin, akran ex-\nousian, kurian arkh[e\u00af], kurion politeuma in Greek, segnioria in Italian, tismar \nshabat in Hebrew),10 you will see that although he posits that \u201csovereignty \n10.

For the Hebrew, Derrida here gives the transliteration tismar shabat; further \non, in the eighth session, he writes Tismar schabet. According to Jean-Jacques Lavoie, \nthe retranscription of these words also involves errors, and the text cited is dif\ufb01 cult \nto read because the last letter is cut off.

If God is \nthe model of sovereignty, saying \u201cGod like the beast\u201d puts us again on the \nsame track, snif\ufb01 ng out everything that might attract the one to the other, \nvia this like, the sovereign and the animal, the hypersovereign that God is, \nand the beast.

Hobbes strongly condemns\u2014in a rather symptomatic, scathing tone, \nI think\u2014those who invoke such a convention with God. He does so in \nchapter 18 of the Leviathan. This is the moment when he recalls that some \npeople, in order to disobey their human sovereign, and therefore the con-\nvention that commits them with respect to the sovereign, have claimed to \nrefer to another convention, to a \u201cnew Covenant,\u201d made this time not with \nhumans but with God\u2014the moment when he recalls, basically, that some \npeople posit a law above the laws, a justice above right, and a sovereign \nabove the sovereign; and here Hobbes energetically replies: No; it is just \nas \u201cunjust\u201d to claim that as it is to disobey the sovereign. For there is no \nconvention, no covenant with God. As this is dif\ufb01 cult to say and have ac-\ncepted in this form, Hobbes has to complicate things a little by distinguish-\ning the mediate from the immediate. He basically speci\ufb01 es that there is no \nimmediate convenant with God, but only \u201cby mediation of some body that \nrepresenteth God\u2019s person, which none doth but Gods Lieutenant,\u201d who \nhas sovereignty under God. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cthis pretence of Covenant with \nGod, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own consciences, that is not \nonely an act of an unjust, but also a vile, and unmanly disposition.\u201d17\nThis passage is rich, complex, and abyssal.

If one cannot make a convention \nwith the beast, any more than with God, it is for a reason of language. The \nbeast does not understand our language, and God cannot respond to us, \nthat is, cannot make known to us, and so we could not know in return if our \nconvention is or is not accepted by him. In both cases, there could not be an \nexchange, shared speech, question and response, proposition and response, \nas any contract, convention, or covenant seems to demand. I shall say in \na moment why it is important to me to insist not only on language as ex-\nchange but on this dimension and this moment of response or responsibility. \nBefore I do that, I quote these two paragraphs from chapter 16. The second \nconcerns the exclusion of the covenant with God, but if it is not redundant \nwith respect to the one I have already quoted, this is precisely because of the \nargument he puts forward this time, that of the acceptance of the contract in \na response. Here is the quotation:\nTo make covenant with God, is impossible, but by Mediation of such as \nGod speaketh to [argument of the lieutenant again, then], either by Revela-\ntion supernaturall, or by his Lieutenants that govern under him, and in his \nName: For otherwise we know not whether our Covenants be accepted or \nnot. (p. 77)\nJust before, in the preceding paragraph, Hobbes had posited (and I mean \nposited, for there is something profoundly thetical and dogmatic in this ges-\nture) that a covenant with beasts, brute beasts, is impossible. He used the \nsame terms and the same syntax as for God at the beginning of the follow-\ning paragraph (\u201cTo make covenant with God, is impossible\u201d) and here for \nthe beast: \u201cTo make Covenant with bruit beasts is impossible.\u201d And in the \nargument about language, that beasts do not understand, we \ufb01 nd again \nthe word \u201caccept\u201d: brute beasts could not accept or make known to us, any \nmore than God could, that they accept a convention or enter into that mu-\ntual acceptance that a convention is. Here:\nTo make Covenant with bruit Beasts, is impossible; because not under-\nstanding our speech, they understand not, nor accept of any translation of \nRight; nor can translate any Right to another: and without mutuall accepta-\ntion, there is no Covenant. (Ibid., my emphasis)\nI shall not hasten to say brutally, as I in fact think, that all that is brutally \nfalse, that it is false to say that beasts in general (supposing any such thing \nto exist) or so- called brute beasts (what does \u201cbrute\u201d mean?) do not under-\n89 \n"

Later, \nwe shall read a chapter from De Cive in which, criticizing Aristotle, Hobbes \nsays more about the beasts and the reasons why, in his view, animal societies \ndo not merit the name of \u201ccivil societies.\u201d24 And, above all, and this is more \ninteresting for us at this point, the double exclusion we are talking about, in \nassociating in nonconvention beast and God, but also in nonresponse, gives us \nto think that the sovereign\u2019s sovereign, God himself, like the beast, does not \nrespond, that in any case we cannot be assured of his acceptance, we cannot \ncount on his response. And that is indeed the most profound de\ufb01 nition of \nabsolute sovereignty, of the absolute of sovereignty, of that absoluteness that \nabsolves it, unbinds it from all duty of reciprocity. The sovereign does not \nrespond, he is the one who does not have to, who always has the right not \nto, respond [r\u00e9pondre], in particular not to be responsible for [r\u00e9pondre de] his \nacts. He is above the law [le droit] and has the right [le droit] to suspend the \nlaw, he does not have to respond before a representative chamber or before \njudges, he grants pardon or not after the law has passed. The sovereign has \nthe right not to respond, he has the right to the silence of that dissymmetry. \nHe has the right to a certain irresponsibility. Whence our obscure but I believe \nlucid affect, whence the double sentiment that assails us faced with the abso-\nlute sovereign: like God, the sovereign is above the law and above humanity, \nabove everything, and he looks a bit stupid [b\u00eate], he looks like the beast, and \neven like the death he carries within him, like that death that L\u00e9vinas says is \nnot nothingness, nonbeing, but nonresponse. The sovereign like a God, like a \nbeast, or like death, those are the remains of a \u201clike\u201d that are still on our table. \nIf sovereignty were (but I don\u2019t believe it) proper to man, it would be so much \nlike this expropriating ecstasy of irresponsibility, like this place of nonresponse \nthat is commonly and dogmatically called bestiality, divinity, or death. \nAt this point, and to conclude today by recalling what we have not \nceased to follow, stealthy as wolves, the trace of the wolf that we shall be \nseeing again in January when we read La Fontaine\u2019s The Wolf and the Lamb \nafter September 11, I shall be content to reconnoiter very rapidly a sort of \nstrange genealogy of the wolf (lukos), a genelycological \ufb01 liation, a strange \ngenelycology, the path of a track that, from one cave to another, leads to \nthe alliance (from north, south, east or west) between all these claimants to \nsovereignty who thus assemble and so resemble each other: the wolf, man, \nGod.

Finally, the \u201ccommon saying,\u201d referring to the at least supposed origin \nof this saying, i.e. Plautus, who was born in Sarsina, in northern Umbria\u2014\nbasically in a colony of Rome\u2014and who learned Latin and came to the \ncapital very young. I will content myself with reading and translating the \ntwo lines from the comedy Asinaria (we\u2019ll come back to all this next time), \ntwo lines that propose, or dare I say prosopose, the \ufb01 gure of the wolf, the \nface of the wolf, the mask of the wolf, onto what is most unknown in man. \nThe wolf is, for man, man himself, but for as long as one does not know \nhim, inasmuch as one does not know him [tant qu\u2019on ne le conna\u00eet pas, en \ntant qu\u2019on ne le conna\u00eet pas]. The wolf is man tant que and en tant que, during \nthe time and to the extent that he remains unknown and therefore does not \nmake himself known. The wolf is man for man to the extent that [(en) tant \nque] he exceeds all knowledge and making- known: \u201cLupus est homo homini, \nnon homo, quom qualis sit non novit.\u201d Literally: \u201cWolf [the wolf] is man for \nman, and not a man, when [like or as] one does not know which he is.\u201d31 In \nother words, wherever man does not make known to man who or which \nhe is, he becomes a wolf. Who or which [qui ou quel] (qualis) can also mean \nwho or what [qui ou quoi].\nJust as Montaigne\u2019s sentence was inscribed in a  marriage- contract scene, \nhere we must not neglect the fact that this sentence from Plautus is placed \nin the mouth of a merchant (mercator) and that we are dealing with a capi-\ntalistic market scene, a scene of lending or credit [de cr\u00e9ance ou de cr\u00e9dit]. \nThe merchant does not want to give credit, entrust or lend money to, some-\none he does not know, and who could, then, behave like a wolf. Who\u2014or \nwhat\u2014is the wolf? And is not the substitution of wolf for man, the substi-\ntution, for man, of the wolfman for man, the substitution of what for who?\nGo \ufb01 gure [Allez savoir]. That\u2019s what the mercator is implying. He wants \nto know and he asks \u201cgo \ufb01 gure,\u201d because \u201cLupus est homo homini, non homo, \nquom qualis sit non novit,\u201d which can be translated, as in the [French] trans-\nlation I have to hand (Alfred Ernout) as \u201cWhen one does not know him, \nman is not a man, but a wolf for man,\u201d but perhaps too, in a less convincing \nbut grammatically possible way: \u201cWolf [the wolf] is a man for man, which \nis not a man, when one does not know him.\u201d\nThis grammar, the same and different, shakes up the decidable authority \nof the \u201cwho\u201d and the \u201cwhat\u201d and the order of substitution. The beast\u2014is it \n31. Plautus, Asinaria, line 495.\n96 \n"

Or not suppress them? Or not repress them? Or not neglect them? \nAnd if to forget, suppress, repress, neglect, with or without negation, dis-\navowal or denial, is in a certain way to chase (away), is chasing to expel, \nexclude, \ufb02 ee, neglect, or else, on the contrary, to follow, pursue, persecute, \ntrack down, run after?\nSo we still need to know how to deal with the wolf. And to know what \nkind of chase we\u2019re dealing with, in what we have called our genealogy of \nthe wolf, our book of wolves, our genelycology. A genelycology that must \ninscribe in its tree, its genealogical tree, what is called the lycanthrope, the \nwolf- man, man made wolf or wolf made man.\nWhen one associates the wolf with the tree, there immediately arises the \ndream of Freud\u2019s Wolf Man,3 the Wolf Mann who recounts how he saw, in \na dream, sitting in a tree, a big walnut tree, six or seven white wolves who, \nlet\u2019s not forget, also resembled other animals, foxes, he said \u2014 and there are \nfoxes waiting for us today \u2014 or sheepdogs, because they had big tails like \n(like, always the analogy!) foxes, and ears pricked like (like!) dogs. So there is \na whole menagerie, a whole zoological crowd that does more than swarm, \nthat is meaningfully organized in the Wolf Man\u2019s dream. Other animals \nwill come up in the analysis, for example, the wasp and the butter\ufb02 y. And \nthe Wolf Man immediately admits his fear of being devoured by the wolf: \nit is this terror, this terrorism of wolves, that wakes him up by making him \ncry out. He refers himself, to account for his associations, to a book, pre-\ncisely, a book that Freud does not neglect in his interpretation, namely the \nillustration of a fable or a narrative, \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood.\u201d To explain \nthe \ufb01 gure of six or seven wolves, Freud has him be more speci\ufb01 c with refer-\n2.

We shall also be coming back to this question of the schoolmaster \ntoday. But I leave you to reread the Wolf Man, which I abandon here, for in \nthis genelycological tree, in this library of wolves, what we shall in the end \nbe interested in today is not so much the \u201cWolf Man\u201d as the wolf- man, the \nlycanthrope, the  becoming- man of the wolf and the  becoming- wolf of the \nman.

Vociferation and devourment, we were saying, \nbut let us not hasten to attribute speech to the mouth of man supposed to \nspeak and voracity or even the vociferation of the cry to the animal\u2019s maw. \nIt is precisely this simple and dogmatic opposition, the abuses of this over-\nsimpli\ufb01 cation that we have in our sights here.\nWe had, then, started to give some weight to an oscillation, a vacillation \ncome in a not quite fortuitous way to affect the pendulum of the title thus \n100 \n"

This \noscillating or vacillating rhythm is imprinted on each of its words, the ar-\nticles (la, le), the nouns or substantives (b\u00eate, souverain), the verb, the copula \nor the conjunction (et, e[s]t). And as I have just noted, the suspension of this \npendulum is double.\nOn the one hand, \ufb01 rst oscillation, the sexual difference marked at least \nby French grammar (la . . . le), which seemed by chance (as we illustrated \nwith more than one fact and more than one text) to con\ufb01 rm that the beast \nwas often the living thing to be subjected, dominated, domesticated, mas-\ntered, like, by a not insigni\ufb01 cant analogy, the woman, the slave, or the child. \nRemember the Hobbes texts we read on this subject, on the subject of the \nright over beasts, in the De Cive. And the sexual difference that seemed \nalso to con\ufb01 rm (as we illustrated with more than one fact and more than \none text) that the sovereign appeared most often in the masculine \ufb01 gure of \nthe king, the master, the chief, the paterfamilias, or the husband \u2014 of the \nipseity of the ipse, concerning which a few years ago, reading Benveniste, \nwe had emphasized that, in its very etymology,4 it implies the exercise of \npower by someone it suf\ufb01 ces to designate as himself, ipse. The sovereign, \nin the broadest sense of the term, is he who has the right and the strength \nto be and be recognized as himself, the same, properly the same as himself. \nBenveniste, to whom I refer you, goes on to wonder about the \ufb01 liation of \npoti, Sanskrit patyate, Latin potior (to have power over something, to have at \none\u2019s disposal, to possess, potsedere): \u201cThe notion of \u2018power\u2019 [. . .] is then con-\nstituted and it receives its verbal form from the predicative expression pote \nest contracted into potest which engenders the conjugation possum, potest, \u2018I \nam capable, I can.\u2019 \u201d5 Now, and I insist on this point, for we will not cease to \nmeasure its consequences, Benveniste had inscribed the value of ipseity, the \nipse, the \u201coneself,\u201d the \u201chim(one)self\u201d in the same \ufb01 liation, as though power \nwere \ufb01 rst of all recognized in the one who could be designated or who \ncould be the \ufb01 rst to designate himself as the same, a himself, a oneself. We \ncommented a few years back on these lines of Benveniste, who is surprised \nthat a word meaning \u201cmaster\u201d (as he had shown a page earlier: potis, in San-\nskrit patih (master and husband), in Greek posis (husband), in composition \ndespote\u00afs) should become so enfeebled (Benveniste\u2019s word and evaluation, but \nI do not believe one can speak here of enfeeblement, of loss of power \u2014 to \nthe contrary) as to signify \u201chimself.\u201d On the other hand, Benveniste un-\n4. \u00c9mile Benveniste, article \u201cHospitalit\u00e9,\u201d in Le vocabulaire des institutions europ\u00e9-\nennes, 2 vols.

In short, the sovereign. In Rus-\nsian, sam (himself) names the lord. Among the Pythagoreans, the master \nPythagoras was designated as autos, autos epha: he said it himself, i.e. the \nmaster said. \u201cIn Danish han sj\u00f8lv, \u2018er selbst,\u2019 has the same meaning.\u201d The \nmaster (and what is said of the master is easily transferable to the \ufb01 rst of all, \nthe prince, the sovereign), the master is he who is said to be, and who can \nsay \u201chimself\u201d to be, the (self- )same, \u201cmyself.\u201d\nThe concept of sovereignty will always imply the possibility of this po-\nsitionality, this thesis, this self- thesis, this autoposition of him who posits or \nposits himself as ipse, the (self- )same, oneself. And that will be just as much \nthe case for all the \u201c\ufb01 rsts,\u201d for the sovereign as princely person, the monarch \nor the emperor or the dictator, as for the people in a democracy, or even \nfor the  citizen- subject in the exercise of his sovereign liberty (for example, \nwhen he votes or places his secret ballot in the box, sovereignly). In sum, \nwherever there is a decision worthy of the name, in the classical sense of the \nterm. Dictatorship (and in a minimal and strict sense sovereignty is always \na moment of dictatorship, even if one does not live in a so- called dictatorial \nregime) is always the essence of sovereignty, where it is linked to the power \nto say in the form of dictation, prescription, order or diktat. From the Ro-\nman dictatura, where the dictator is the supreme and extraordinary magis-\ntrate, sometimes the \ufb01 rst magistrate, and so the master of certain cities, to \nmodern forms of dictatorship such as F\u00fchrer or Duce or the Little Father \nof the People or some other \u201cpapadoc,\u201d6 but also in the \ufb01 gure of the dicta-\ntorship of the proletariat, in dictatorship in general as power that exercises \nitself unconditionally in the form of the Diktat, of the ultimate saying or the \nperformative verdict that gives orders and has no account to render other \nthan to itself (ipse), and not to any superior agency, especially not a par-\nliament \u2014 well, that dictatorship, that dictatorial agency, is at work every-\nwhere, wherever there is sovereignty.\n6.

In passing, Deleuze \nmakes fun of psychoanalysis when it talks about animals, makes fun as he \noften does, sometimes a little hastily, and not only does he make fun of it but \nhe says, which is even funnier, that the animals themselves make fun of it. \nThis is on pages 294\u201395 [240\u201341] of Mille plateaux:\nWe would even have to distinguish three sorts of animals: individuated \nanimals, familiar and familial, sentimental, Oedipal animals, part of our \nlittle story, \u201cmy\u201d cat, \u201cmy\u201d dog; they invite us to regress, they draw us into \nnarcissistic contemplation, and psychoanalysis understands only these ani-\nmals, the better to discover underneath the image of a Daddy, a Mommy, a \nlittle brother (when psychoanalysis talks about animals, the animals learn \nto laugh); all the people who love cats and dogs are idiots [des cons]. And then \nthere would be a second sort, animals with character or attribute, animals of \ngenus, classi\ufb01 cation, or state, the way the great divine myths treat them, to \nextract from them series or structures, archetypes or models (Jung is more \nprofound than Freud, though). Finally, there would be more demoniacal \nanimals, with packs and affects, and who produce multiplicity, becoming, \npopulation, fairy tale . . . Or else, once more, is it not all animals that can \nbe treated these three ways? There will always be the possibility that any \nanimal, louse, cheetah, or elephant, be treated as a familiar animal, my little \nanimal. And, at the other extreme, any animal can also be treated after the \nmanner of pack and swarming, which suits us sorcerers better. Even the \ncat, even the dog . . . And if the shepherd or the leader of the pack, the devil \nhave his favorite animal in the pack, this is certainly not in the same way as \njust now. Yes, any animal is or can be a pack, but with varying degrees of \nvocation for it, which makes it more or less easy to discover the multiplicity, \nthe tenor in multiplicity, that it contains actually or virtually in each case. \nBanks, bands, \ufb02 ocks, populations are not inferior social forms, they are af-\nfects and potentials, involutions, which catch up all animals in a becoming \nthat is no less powerful than that of man with animal.\nAnd of course the question that will traverse this whole seminar, whether it \nbe itself present and pressing, itself, explicitly, in person, or indirectly, will \nalways be that of the \u201cproper to man.\u201d And, moreover, bestiality, character-\nized either as perversion or sexual deviancy, zoophilia that pushes people to \nmake love with beasts or to make love to beasts, or as cruelty \u2014 this bestial-\nity, this double bestiality (zoophilic or cruel) would also be proper to man. \nAnd later we shall look closely at a text of Lacan\u2019s on this subject (bestial \ncruelty as proper to man).\n105 \n"

In truth, and this is \nwhy I say \u201cinvocation\u201d of the human or the humanitarian above the interest \nof the state, Schmitt believes he can always discern in this humanistic and \nhumanitarian discourse a ruse of war, a strategic ruse put to work by a state \nstruggling for hegemony, the ruse of a wolf, a werewolf, if not of a fox (let us \nnever forget the wolves and the foxes). Depoliticization, the move beyond \nstate sovereignty would on this view be a piece of hypocrisy in the service \nof a sovereignty, of a determinate  nation- state hegemony. Schmitt, in the \n1930s, is not yet speaking of \u201cglobalization [mondialisation: worldwidiza-\ntion],\u201d but this is clearly what he has in view in his critique of the premises \nof a new international right, a Society of nations, etc. The world of global-\nization would then be a stratagem, a false concept or a concept forged in or-\nder to pass off some particular interest as a worldwide or universal interest, \npass off the interest of one  nation- state or a restricted group of  nation- states \nas the world, as the universal interest of humanity in general, as the interest \nof the proper of man in general. After having asserted that \u201chumanity as \nsuch [Die Menschheit als solche] cannot wage war because it has no enemy, \nat least on this planet [comment on this last detail].

This argument of Schmitt\u2019s, and this is all I want to \nretain from it for now, is that there is no politics, no politicity of the political \nwithout af\ufb01 rmation of sovereignty, that the privileged if not unique form \nof that sovereignty is the state, state sovereignty, and that such a political \nsovereignty in the form of the state presupposes the determination of an \nenemy; and this determination of the enemy can in no case take place, by \nde\ufb01 nition, in the name of humanity. The concept of this sovereignty which \nnever goes without an enemy, which needs the enemy to be what it is, is not \nnecessarily linked or limited to such or such a state structure (monarchi-\ncal, oligarchical, democratic, or republican). Even when the sovereign is the \npeople or the nation, this does not damage the law, structure, or vocation of \nsovereignty, as Schmitt de\ufb01 nes it (the positing of an enemy without human-\nist or humanitarian invocation; the right to exception; the right to suspend \nright; the right to be outside the law).\nThis is why Schmitt will have quoted, before the passage I just read, an \neloquent declaration in this respect by the Committee for Public Safety, in \n1793. This declaration, quoted by Schmitt, is \ufb01 rst quoted by Ernst Friesen-\nhahn <in> Der politische Eid (The Political Oath). (I recall this title to re-\ninscribe this statement in a logic of the oath that makes of the af\ufb01 rmation \nof sovereignty a performative, a commitment, an act of sworn faith, of war \ndeclared against a sworn enemy: sovereignty is a posited law, a thesis or \na prosthesis, and not a natural given, it is the sworn institution \u2014 a faith \nsworn, and therefore structurally \ufb01 ctional, \ufb01 gural, invented, conventional, \nas Hobbes clearly shows, moreover \u2014 the institution of a law that was never \nfound in nature; but precisely the question then returns of the link between \nthis right, the force of law and force tout court, the disposition of force tout \ncourt, of a force that makes right, of a reason of the strongest which is or \nis not the best; but I emphasize this reference to oath and \ufb01 delity to sworn \nfaith to announce a detour that we shall need to make in a moment, toward \nMachiavelli\u2019s Prince and his wolf \u2014 that we must not forget).

Let\u2019s never forget the he- wolf and the she- wolf, \nwe were saying. One always forgets a wolf along the way. For example, in \nthe last session, even as I was pointing out that homo homini lupus was to be \nfound, literally, long before Montaigne and Hobbes, in Plautus, I neglected \nor pretended to neglect, I had omitted if not forgotten, a wolf in Machiavelli \n(another great positive hero, for Schmitt, of the theory of the political), a \nMachiavelli that Hobbes must have read and a Machiavelli whose Prince, \nprecisely, also names the wolf loud and clear. But if I pretended to forget \nthis wolf, to suppress or repress it, to chase it away like another one I\u2019ll come \nto in a moment (Machiavelli will tell us how to beat back, chase away, or \nhunt this wolf), it was intentionally, for reasons I\u2019m going to show you in a \nmoment, with the intention of drawing your attention today to composite \n\ufb01 gures, fabulous grafts of man- beasts or human animals, mixes \u2014 that we \nhaven\u2019t yet talked about.

If there is something prosthstatic in it, this is not by \nreason of a composition, of a synthesis, of a composite essence of man and \nbeast, like those we are getting ready to encounter. The Leviathan, a mon-\nstrous animal, is not monstrous after the fashion of Khimaira, the chimera, \na monster from Lycia, born of Typhon and Echidna, with three heads, lion, \ngoat, dragon spitting \ufb02 ames, killed by Bellerophon, and which, having de-\nscended to a common noun, has given its name to all sorts of fabulations, \nfantasies, mythical productions, or hallucinations (even in Descartes) which \nare precisely the element of what is of interest to us here, the element of \nfabulation in which the analogies between beast and sovereign \ufb01 nd their \nresources and their schemata. I\u2019m using the word schema by analogy, but \nprimarily to signal toward analogy, precisely, i.e. toward the mediating ele-\nment or the mixed. Just as Kant said that the schema of the imagination \nwas the mediation between intuition and the concept of the understanding, \nparticipating in both at once, so we are dealing here with schematic and \nimaginative and fantastic and fabulous and chimerical and synthetic \ufb01 g-\nures that mediate between two orders and participate in two organizations \nof the living creature, what is still called the animal and what is still called \nman, or again what is called beast and what is called sovereign. But if it is \nindeed this fantastic and synthetic and prosthetic composition that matters \nto us here, today it is neither on the side of the Leviathan nor on the side of \nthe Chimera that we shall search for or encounter our monsters, but on the \nside of another logic of composition, graft, mixture, and biosynthetic alloy.\n(On the horizon of this encounter is a double question, which I leave \nopen: in the \ufb01 rst place, why, in the great corpus of animal \ufb01 gures that people \nthe fable of the political, do we \ufb01 nd this or that animal and not others? We \ncan make the most open and liberal list, from the wolf to the fox, from the \nlion to the lamb, from the serpent to the eagle, to ants or frogs, but we\u2019ll \nhave to concede that not all the animals of earth and sky are represented, \ndo not seem to be as prone, as equally appropriate, to political \ufb01 guration. \nWhy? Is it because of the regions of the world, with their speci\ufb01 c fauna, \nbecause of the geographical and ethological areas in which this fabulous \ndiscourse on the political was born and developed its history: the Middle \nEast, Greece, the Mediterranean, Europe? Perhaps. Is it because of the \nproper nature, the form, and the psychology supposed (I stress \u201csupposed\u201d) \nby \ufb01 ction, anthropomorphized in advance to pertain to such animals (the \nsupposed cunning of the fox, the tranquil strength of the lion, the voracious \nviolence of the wolf, who can also turn protective, paternal, and maternal)? \nPerhaps.

You\u2019ll see the wolf go by, but also more composite ani-\nmals. The question of the proper of man is indeed placed at the center of a \ndebate about the force of law, between force and law. In this chapter, which \npasses for one of the most Machiavellian in Machiavelli, he begins by admit-\nting a fact (I stress the word fact): in fact, de facto, one judges praise worthy \nthe \ufb01 delity of a prince to his commitments. It is praiseworthy, one must \nagree. After what looks like a concession (yes, it\u2019s good, it\u2019s praiseworthy, \nit\u2019s a recognized fact that, in principle, by rights, a prince ought to keep his \nword), Machiavelli comes back to the fact, which in fact he has never left. \nIt is a fact that everyone regards the \ufb01 delity of the prince to his given word \nas laudable, but, in fact, few princes are faithful, few princes respect their \ncommitments, and most of them use cunning: they almost all use cunning \nwith their commitments. For they are constrained, in fact, to do so. We saw, \nhe says, we have been in a position to see that the strongest princes, those \nwho won out, beat those who, on the contrary, took as a rule the respect of \ntheir oath (this is why I announced a while ago that I would talk about the \noath).\nMachiavelli\u2019s rhetoric is remarkable, as is his logic. For after having noted \nthis fact (the nonrespect of the oath that wins in fact, perjury that wins de \nfacto, cunning that in reality beats \ufb01 delity), he concludes from this fact, al-\nways in the constative and realistic regime, that political reason must take \naccount and render account of this fact. Political reason must count and cal-\nculate with the fact that, in fact, there are two ways to \ufb01 ght. Following para-\ngraph, then: \u201cThere are two kinds of combat: one with laws, the other with \nforce\u201d (p. 69). The old Giraudet translation [as is the case in the En glish \none by Mans\ufb01 eld] accentuates this constative regime, which is the regime of \ntheoretical knowledge, of the factual description of what one must know, of \nthe  knowledge- of- what- one- needs- to- know: \u201cYou should then know [Ma-\nchiavelli is addressing Lorenzo de Medicis as much as the reader] that there \nare two ways of combating, one with laws, the other with force.\u201d\nSo sometimes with right, justice, \ufb01 delity, respect for the laws, contracts, \n123 \n"

Combat with laws (and so according to \ufb01 delity to \none\u2019s commitments, as a sincere prince respectful of the laws) is, he says, \nproper to man. These are his words (\u201cproper to man\u201d), a Kantian argument \nin its principle, as it were: not to lie, to have the duty not to lie or perjure, is \nproper to man and his dignity. When one lies, when one betrays, which one \ncan always do, in fact one is not speaking as a man, not as a man worthy of \nhuman dignity [digne de la dignit\u00e9 humaine]; in fact, one is not speaking, one \nis not addressing the other as a man, as another man. One is not speaking \nto one\u2019s fellow man [son semblable] (hold on to this value of semblable which \nwill occupy us a great deal later). But what comes next in Machiavelli, who \nis not here speaking from an ethical point of view but from a political point \nof view, and who is measuring the possibility of the political, the law of \nthe political against the test of war \u2014 what comes next in Machiavelli\u2019s dis-\ncourse is, as we might expect, less Kantian. The second way to combat, \nhe says (combat with force) is that of beasts. No longer man but the beast. \nForce and not law, the reason of the strongest, is what is proper to the beast. \nAfter this second moment, Machiavelli notes in a third moment of the argu-\nmentation that, in fact, the \ufb01 rst way to combat (with the law) is insuf\ufb01 cient, \nand remains, in fact, impotent. So one must, in fact, resort to the other. \nThus the prince must combat with both weapons, both law and force. He \nmust then behave both as man and as beast. \u201cTherefore it is necessary for a \nprince to know how to use as appropriate the beast and the man\u201d (p. 69; trans-\nlation modi\ufb01 ed; Derrida\u2019s emphasis).

The human prince must behave as though he \nwere a beast. Machiavelli does not say that the prince is man and beast at the \nsame time, that he has a double nature, but he is not far from saying so and \nfrom putting this double nature under the authority of an \u201cit is necessary.\u201d \nIf the prince is not man and beast at the same time, if in his very essence he \ndoes not unite these two essential attributes, he must nonetheless behave \nas if it were the case \u2014 and Machiavelli recognizes in this \u201cas if\u201d what I \nwould here call two imports [port\u00e9es], a pedagogical import and a rhetori-\ncal import. The pedagogical import is itself double and touches doubly on \nthis  quasi- double nature of the prince, who must act as if he were at once \nman and beast. Pedagogy in the \ufb01 rst place because that is, Machiavelli tells \nus, what the writers of antiquity teach and have taught us. And this teach-\ning will have taken an allegorical form (that is Machiavelli\u2019s word). It is by \nallegory or \u201canimal\u201d fabulation, the better to be heard, that these ancient \nwriters called in animal \ufb01 gures. But this time it is not a question of this or \nthat animal but of a man- horse mix, the centaur Chiron (Kentauros, the \nnoun; the Greek adjective kantoris meant worthy of a centaur, i.e. brutal, \ncoarse, bestial). The Kentauros was a hybrid being, born of Kentauros and \nThessalian mares: a huge history to which I refer you. One could devote \nmore than one seminar to it. There is a book by Dum\u00e9zil on the problem \nof centaurs (1929).19\nTo remain with the minimum that matters to us here, I recall that cen-\ntaurs (often represented, in their double \u2014 human and animal \u2014 nature by \nthe articulation of a human front (human trunk and face) and an equine \nrear, in a horizontal order, then, not vertical, front and rear and not top and \nbottom) also present another ambiguity, besides that of the human and the \n(equine) animal. For they are both savages, savage beasts (ther), barbarian, \nterribly natural and, on the other hand, civilizing heroes, masters, peda-\ngogues, initiators into the most diverse domains, skillful with their hands \n(the name Chiron allegedly comes from cheir, hand, whence surgery, and \ncentaurs have not only human trunk and face but also human arms and \nhands), initiators, then, in the art of hunting, and hence cynegetics, music, \nmedicine, etc. On the one hand, they represent the most asocial savagery, \nand Apollodorus will say of them that they are \u201csavage, without social or-\n19.

One must not seem to be too \n\u201crational,\u201d says the directive, in determining what is most precious to the \nenemy. In other words, one must show oneself to be blind, make it known \nthat one can be blind and stupid [b\u00eate] in the choice of targets, just so as to \nbe frightening and have the enemy believe that one is acting at random, that \none goes crazy when vital interests are affected.

There is a hierarchy here: man, fox, lion, going from the more human, \nthe more rational and intelligent, to the more animal, even the more bes-\ntial, if not to the more b\u00eate. Precisely because he knows how to be cunning, \nhow to lie, how to commit perjury, because he has the sense and culture of \nthe snare, the fox is closer to the truth of man and man\u2019s \ufb01 delity, which he \nunderstands and knows how to invert. The fox can be cunning and unfaith-\nful; he knows how to betray, whereas the lion does not even understand the \nopposition of faithful and unfaithful, veracity and lying. The fox is more \nhuman than the lion.\n3. The privilege of the fox is therefore clear in this princely alliance of \nthe lion and the fox against the wolves.

I was preached against from the pulpit, called the antichrist, and \npursued across the countryside like a werewolf. My Armenian dress gave \nme away to the populace: I cruelly felt the drawback it represented, but \ntaking it off in these circumstances seemed cowardice to me. I could not \nresolve to do it, and walked calmly abroad with my kaftan and fur bon-\nnet surrounded by the cries of the rabble and sometimes its stones. Several \ntimes as I walked past a house, I heard the inhabitants saying: bring me my \ngun so I can shoot him.7\nCruelty, then, criminality, being outside the (religious or civil) law, being \nwithout faith or law, that\u2019s what characterizes, not the wolf itself, but the \nwerewolf, the wolf- man, the lycanthrope, the mad or sick man. This cru-\nelty of the \u201cwithout faith or law\u201d would then be proper to man, that bestial-\nity that is attributed to man and causes him to be compared to a beast, and \napparently also proper to man in that he presupposes the law, even when he \nopposes it, whereas the beast itself, even if it can be violent and ignore the \nlaw, cannot, in this classical logic, be held to be bestial. Like b\u00eatise, bestiality, \nbestial cruelty would thus be proper to man. That is the question, and that \nis also the deep axiomatics the path and statements of which I announced \nwe would follow and problematize in Lacan.\nThe stakes are sizable.

My hypothesis is that Lacan\u2019s discourse \nplays this double role.\nBefore broadening and gradually diversifying our references to the La-\ncanian corpus, I shall take as my starting point a noteworthy article in the \n\u00c9crits entitled \u201cFunctions of Psychoanalysis in Criminology\u201d (1950),8 which \nI invite you to read in its entirety.\nLacan begins by recalling something that is very classical and tradi-\ntional, however novel it may look under his pen. What? Lacan begins by \ndeclaring that what is proper to man, the origin of man, the place where \nhumanity begins, is the Law, the relation to the Law (with a capital L). In \nother words, what separates Man from Beast is the Law, the experience \nof the Law, the Superego, and therefore the possibility of transgressing it \nin Crime. Basically, as opposed to the Beast, Man can obey or not obey the \nLaw. Only he has that liberty. Only he, then, can become criminal. The \nbeast can kill and do what seems to us bad or wicked but will never be \nheld to be criminal, never be incriminated, one cannot have a beast appear \nbefore the law (even though that has happened, and we need to remember \nthat fact, but let\u2019s leave it for now). Lacan is here on the side of a certain \ncommon sense, according to which the beast, ignorant of the Law, is not \nfree, neither responsible nor culpable, cannot transgress a Law it does not \nknow, cannot be held to be criminal. A beast never commits a crime and is \nnever in infraction of the law. Which means that Crime, as transgression \nof the Law, would be proper to man. With Law and Crime, man begins. \nI quote:\nOne imagines that having received in psychology such an input from the \nsocial, Freud the doctor should have been tempted to give something back, \nand that with Totem and Taboo in 1912, he should have wished to demon-\nstrate in the primordial crime the origin of the universal Law. However \nsubject to methodological criticism this work may be, the important thing \nis that it recognized that with Law and Crime begins man, after the cli-\nnician had shown that their meanings supported everything down to the \nform of the individual not only in his value for the other, but in his erection \nfor himself.\n \nThus the conception of the superego saw the light of day.9\n8.

What Lacan immediately im-\nplies with this distinction between acquired and innate is that the animal \n(as he says everywhere else, as we shall see) is con\ufb01 ned to this \ufb01 xity of the \ninnate, innate wiring or programming, whereas man, in his relation to the \nlaw (and therefore to crime), is not so con\ufb01 ned. Always the question of \nliberty and the machine. The question, then, is indeed the old question of \nthe innate and the acquired. Not that, for Lacan, there can be no \ufb01 xed and \nanimal instinct in man: of course there is an animality in man, but crime, \ncruelty, and ferocity do not come from instinct, they transcend animality, \nthey assume not merely a \u201cliberty\u201d and a \u201cresponsibility,\u201d and therefore a \n\u201cpeccability\u201d (words that Lacan is careful not to pronounce here, but with \nrespect to which we shall see later that the corresponding and indissociable \nconcepts, especially those of response and responsibility, play a decisive role), \nthese statements also assume that clarity has been achieved with respect to a \nword that Lacan not only puts forward twice, but that here literally desig-\nnates the major criterion: namely the word \u201cfellow\u201d [semblable].\nWhat is supposed to distinguish man, as \u201cwolf for man,\u201d from the animal, \nwhat is supposed to distinguish the wolf- man or the werewolf from the ani-\nmal, and thus from the wolf itself, what is supposed to distinguish human \ncruelty or ferocity from all animal violence \u2014 animal violence to which one \ncannot consequently give the attribute of cruelty (only man is cruel, the \nanimal can harm, but it cannot do evil for evil and so be cruel) \u2014 what is \nsupposed to distinguish cruel humanity from non- cruel (and therefore in-\nnocent) animality is that the cruel man attacks his fellow, which the animal \nsupposedly does not. So it is this notion of \u201cfellow\u201d which will carry the \nwhole burden of the demonstration (which is, moreover, as classical and \ntraditional as can be, in my view) by which Lacan intends to correct the \nerror he supposes has been made in the interpretation of homo homini lupus \n(\u201cthe form of the adage,\u201d he says and I recall, \u201cmisleads as to its meaning\u201d), \nan error that supposedly would consist in believing that man is a wolf, and \nthus an animal for man, which Lacan is about to contest.

But they are three points that will constantly, when we \nread other texts of Lacan\u2019s, tie in with an immense discursive woof or warp \nthat seems to me to be problematic through and through.\n1. First, the distinction between the innate and the acquired, and thus be-\ntween instinct and everything that goes with \u201cculture,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d \u201cinstitution,\u201d \n\u201cfreedom,\u201d etc., has always been fragile, <and> is more fragile than ever \ntoday, exactly like the presupposition of an animality deprived of language, \nhistory, culture, technique, relation to death as such, and the transmission of \nacquired knowledge. I am one of those \u2014 it is true that there are not many \nof us \u2014 who have always smiled at this machine of presuppositions to be \ndeconstructed. But it happens moreover that the most positive science to-\nday (see the recently published book on the origins of man (Coppens???))16 \nshows that some animals (not that hypostatic \ufb01 ction labeled The Animal, \nof course, but some among those that are classi\ufb01 ed as animals) have a his-\ntory and techniques, and thus a culture in the most rigorous sense of the \nterm, i.e. precisely, the transmission and accumulation of knowledge and \nacquired capacities. And where there is transgenerational transmission, \nthere is law, and therefore crime and peccability.\n2. Saying that cruelty is essentially human because it consists in caus-\ning suffering to one\u2019s fellow comes down to giving an exorbitant credit to \nthis value of the fellow. Even more so if we say that when one is cruel to \nanother species, it is still one\u2019s fellow that one is targeting. Even when one is \ncruel with respect to this or that animal, Lacan is basically suggesting, it is \na man one is targeting \u2014 a fertile hypothesis and one no doubt to be taken \nseriously, but which does not prove that all cruelty with respect to one\u2019s \nnon- fellow [dissemblable] is immediately rendered innocent because what it \nis targeting in truth and at bottom is still the fellow, man targeted through \nthe animal. How does one recognize a fellow? Is the \u201cfellow\u201d only what has \nhuman form, or is it anything that is alive? And if it is the human form of \nlife, what will be the criteria for identifying it without implying a whole de-\nterminate culture, for example European, Greco- Abrahamic culture, and \nin particular Christian culture, which installs the value of \u201cneighbor\u201d or \n\u201cbrother\u201d in the universality of the world, as totality of all creatures?

Especially to an \u201ceternal fraternity\u201d \u2014 which I \nsaid a moment ago ran the risk of being overcon\ufb01 dent. But Lacan, as he re-\ncalls earlier in the same article, does not forget the murderous violence that \nwill have presided over the establishment of the law, namely the murder \nof the father, thanks to which (thanks to the murder, thanks to the father, \nthanks to the murder of the father) the guilty and shameful sons come to \ncontract, through a sort of at least tacit oath or sworn faith, the equality of \nthe brothers. The trace of this founding criminality or this primitive crime, \nthe memory of which is kept by the (animal) totem and the taboo \u2014 this \nmurderous trace remains ineffaceable in any egalitarian, communitarian, \nand compassional fraternity, in this primitive contract that makes of any \ncompassional community a cofraternity.\nThere remains the immense risk of what is still a fraternalism of the \u201cfel-\nlow.\u201d This risk is double (and also affects L\u00e9vinas\u2019s discourse, let it be said \nin passing): on the one hand, this fraternalism frees us from all ethical obli-\ngation, all duty not to be criminal and cruel, precisely, with respect to any \nliving being that is not my fellow or is not recognized as my fellow, because \nit is other and other than man. In this logic, one is never cruel toward what \nis called an animal, or a nonhuman living creature. One is already excul-\npated of any crime toward any nonhuman living being. And specifying, on \nthe other hand, as Lacan does: \u201cIt is a fellow that it [this cruelty] is targeting, \neven in a being of another species,\u201d does not change or \ufb01 x anything. It is \nalways my fellow that I am targeting in a being of another species. So the \nfact remains that I cannot be suspected of cruelty with respect to an animal \n17.

Finally, if we rely on Lacan\u2019s axiomatics or good sense, once there is \ncruelty only toward the fellow, well, not only can one cause hurt without \ndoing evil [faire du mal sans faire le mal] and without being cruel not only \ntoward humans not recognized as true humans and true brothers (I leave \nthe choice of examples up to you, and this is not only about racism), but \nalso toward any living being foreign to the human race. The obvious con-\nsequence is that not only would one not be cruel (or criminal, criminaliz-\nable, or culpable) when one caused suffering to people not recognized and \nlegitimized as such (which happens every day somewhere in the world), \nbut one would have the right to in\ufb02 ict the worst suffering on \u201canimals\u201d \nwithout ever being suspected of the least cruelty. There would be no cruelty \nin industrial abattoirs, in the most horri\ufb01 c stockbreeding establishments, \nin bull\ufb01 ghts, in dissections, experimentations, breaking and training, etc., \nin circuses, menageries, and zoos (of which more soon). I need not belabor \nthe point.\nHere, two corollaries that are also two virtual complications of this schema.\nA. First complication. One might object to my objection (so this is an ob-\njection I\u2019m making to myself and that I will try my best to integrate and \ntake into account) that what I am doing is simply an almost limitless broad-\nening of the notion of \u201cfellow\u201d and that in talking about the dissimilar, \nthe non- fellow, I am surreptitiously extending the similar, the fellow, to all \nforms of life, to all species. All animals qua living beings are my fellows. I \naccept this counterproposition, but not without twice further upping the \nante by pointing out:\n1. In the \ufb01 rst place, the \ufb01 rst upping of the ante: that this broadening would \nalready, of itself, be markedly, signi\ufb01 cantly, and obviously in breach with ev-\nerything that everyone has in mind, and Lacan in particular, when they talk \nabout the fellow: fellow means for them, as is undeniably obvious, not \u201cliv-\ning being in general\u201d but \u201cliving being with a human face.\u201d There is here an \nuncrossable qualitative limit; I mean a qualitative and essential limit. To put \nthis limit to the test of the worst experimentations, it is enough to imagine (I \nleave you to do so) a thousand situations in which one would have to decide \nwhich life goes \ufb01 rst \u2014 before the other.

Whatever reply one \nreally gives to this question, whatever decision one takes (and these are not \nabstract and arti\ufb01 cial examples, as one could show, decisions such as this \nare taken every day), what is certain is that in the humanist logic deployed \nby Lacan, the putting to death of the newborn, abandoning the newborn \nto its death, the failure to assist a person in danger that that represents, will \nbe judged to be criminal and cruel, whereas the killing of billions of beasts \nwould not be. The frontier is here qualitative and essential; numbers and \ntime do not count. There is no \u201ccrime against animality\u201d nor crime of geno-\ncide against nonhuman living beings.\n2. In the second place, the second upping of the ante: it is not enough to \nsay that this unconditional ethical obligation, if there is one, binds me to \nthe life of any living being in general. It also binds me twice over to some-\nthing nonliving, namely to the present nonlife or the nonpresent life of \nthose who are not living, present living beings, living beings in the pres-\nent, contemporaries \u2014 i.e. dead living beings and living beings not yet born, \n nonpresent- living- beings or living beings that are not present. One must \ntherefore inscribe death in the concept of life. And you can imagine all the \nconsequences this would have. Moreover, it is not certain that even in the \noriginary history or \ufb01 ction of the murder of the primal father according to \nwhich the  brother- sons subject themselves to the law because, says Freud, \nthe shame of their crime compels them to do so, it is not certain that this \nshame does not signify, always already, in its possibility, the bond of obliga-\ntion or debt with respect to the dead.\nB. Second complication. There are indeed \u201canimal rights\u201d: some national \nlegislations proscribe some acts of violence, some forms of torture or violence \ntoward animals; and there are, as you know, all sorts of likable associations \nin the world that would like to do more, to publish universal declarations of \nthe rights of animals analogous to the declaration of the rights of man. But, \nto put it brie\ufb02 y, the texts of existing laws only forbid certain forms of cruelty \nor torture, but they do not forbid the killing of animals in general, be it for \nthe production of meat for food, or for experimentation and dissection. The \nstruggle against certain forms of hunting and against bull\ufb01 ghting is under \nway and has little chance of getting very far for the moment. Killing an ani-\nmal, at any rate, is not held to be cruel in itself. As for the declarations of the \nrights of animals called for by some people, beyond the fact that they never \n \n158\n"

This is a major failure of logic, the principle of which I merely point \nout, there being no need to say anymore about it here.

Let me read that sentence again:\nif we can provide a more justly rigorous truth, let us not forget that we owe \nit to the following privileged function: that of the recourse of the subject to \nthe subject, which inscribes our duties in the order of eternal fraternity: its \nrule is also the rule of every action allowed us.\nWould it suf\ufb01 ce for an ethics to remind the subject (as L\u00e9vinas will have \nattempted) of its  being- subject, its  being- host or hostage, and thus its being-\n subject to the other, the Wholly Other or to any other [au Tout- Autre ou \u00e0 \ntout autre]?19\nI do not believe so.

In \u201cSubversion of the Subject and \nDialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious\u201d (1960),21 a certain passage \nnames \u201cthe animal\u201d or \u201can animal\u201d \u2014 in the singular and without further \nspeci\ufb01 cation. It marks perhaps both a step beyond and a step backward \nfrom Freud as to the relation between man, the unconscious, and what I \ncall the animot.22 This remarkable page \ufb01 rst gives the impression, and the \nhope, that things are going to change, especially as to the concept of com-\nmunication or information that is assigned to what is called the animal, the \nanimal in general. This \u201canimal\u201d is supposedly only capable, so one thinks, \nof a coded message or a narrowly signaling signi\ufb01 cation, under strict con-\nstraint: \ufb01 xed in its programming. Lacan begins to take on the \u201cplatitude\u201d \nof \u201cmodern information theory.\u201d It is true that he is speaking here of the \nhuman subject and not the animal, but he writes this, which indeed names \nthe sovereign as absolute Master but which seems to announce, and even \nallow one to hope for, a different note:\nThe Other, as prior site of the pure subject of the signi\ufb01 er, holds the  master-\n position in it, even before coming to existence \u2014 to say it with and against \nHegel \u2014 as absolute Master. For what is omitted in the platitude of mod-\nern information theory, is that one cannot even speak of a code unless it be \nchine, like the animal, supposedly cannot do, is not to emit signs but, says the Discourse \non Method (part 5), to \u201crespond.\u201d Like animals, machines that had \u201cthe organs and the \nexternal shape of a monkey [. . .] could not use words or other signs by composing them \nas we do to declare our thoughts to others. For we may well conceive of a machine so \nconstructed that it proffers words, and even words relating to bodily actions that cause \nsome change in its organs; so that if touched in a particular place, it might ask what one \nwishes to say to it, or in another, it might cry out that one is hurting it, and other similar \nthings; but not that it could arrange them diversely to respond [my emphasis\u2014J.D.] to \nthe meaning of everything said in its presence, as the dullest of men can do.\u201d [Transla-\ntor\u2019s note: my translation of Descartes.] \n21.

The the-\nsis is clear: the animal has neither the unconscious nor language, it does not \nhave the other, it has no relation to the other as such, except by an effect of \nthe human order, by contagion, appropriation, domestication.\nNo doubt taking into account the sexualizing specularity of the animal\nis a remarkable advance, even if it captures the animot in the mirror, and \neven if it holds the female pigeon or the desert locust in captivity in the \nimaginary. Referring at this point to the effects of a Gestalt attested to by a \n\u201cbiological experimentation\u201d which does not \ufb01 t with the language of \u201cpsy-\nchic causality,\u201d Lacan praises this theory for nonetheless recognizing that \nthe \u201cmaturation of the gonad in the female pigeon\u201d presupposes \u201cthe sight \nof a congeneric\u201d and therefore another pigeon, whatever its sex. And that is \ntrue to the point that simple re\ufb02 ection in a mirror suf\ufb01 ces.

The analysis of the specular effect in the pigeon is more devel-\noped but goes in the same direction: the ovulation of the female pigeon, \naccording to then recent work by Harrison (1939),28 happens on mere sight \nof a form that suggests a congeneric pigeon, a re\ufb02 ecting sight, basically, \neven in the absence of a real male.

This \nis what Lacan places at the center of his \u201cMirror- Stage . . . ,\u201d namely \u201cthe \ndatum of a true speci\ufb01 c prematurity of birth in humans.\u201d32 The defect linked \nto this prematurity supposedly corresponds to \u201cthe objective notion of the \nanatomical incompleteness of the pyramidal system,\u201d what embryologists \ncall \u201cfetalization,\u201d the link of which to a certain \u201cintra organic mirror\u201d33 is \nrecalled by Lacan. An autotelic specularity of the inside is linked to a defect, \na prematurity, an incompleteness of the little human.\nWe must register with the greatest prudence what we have just rather \nhastily called a limited but incontestable advance, still on the threshold of \n\u201cSubversion of the Subject . . .\u201d For not only can the animal, held in the \nimaginary, not accede to the symbolic, the unconscious, and language (and \ntherefore to the egological function of the autodeictic \u201cI\u201d), but the descrip-\ntion of its semiotic power remained determined, in the \u201cRome Discourse\u201d \n29. \u201cRemarks on Psychic Causality,\u201d pp. 154\u201356.

The insect cannot respond to other characteristics, nor can it dismiss targets \nthat show characteristics incompatible with the expected function. It cannot abandon \nits \ufb02 ight when it \u2018perceives\u2019 that it is not following a female. This insect appears to have \nno means of evaluating how correct its own perceptions are. It therefore seems unduly \ngenerous to attribute to it an intentional capacity properly so called. It responds to signs, but \nthese signs are not characteristics of an independent object; they are characteristics of \nproximal stimulations. As Millikan says, it follows a \u2018proximal rule.\u2019 However, the pre-\nwired response has as its aim the fecundation of a female syrphid, i.e. an object existing \nin the world\u201d (pp. 228\u201329). I emphasize the words that, more than others, would call for \na vigilant reading. The critical or deconstructive reading that we are calling for would \nseek less to give back to the animal or to such and such an insect the powers here being \ndenied it (even though that sometimes seems possible) <than> to wonder if the same \ntype of analysis could not claim just as much relevance in the case of man, for example \nin the \u201cwiring\u201d of his sexual and reproductive behavior.

And, above all, in an entirely \nlegitimate way, beyond biologism, behaviorist physicalism, geneticism, etc. \nFor Heidegger as for Lacan and so many others, the point at that time was \nto lay out a new fundamental anthropology and to reply to and for the ques-\ntion \u201cWhat is man?\u201d This moment has not at all been left behind, it is even \nputting forward new forms of the same dangers.)\nIn \u201cSubversion of the Subject . . . ,\u201d the re\ufb01 nement of the analysis bears \non other conceptual distinctions. They seem equally problematic to me as \nthose we have just been analyzing and, moreover, remain indissociable \nfrom them.\nWe are dealing apparently with a parenthesis (\u201cLet us observe in a pa-\nrenthesis . . .\u201d), but a parenthesis that to my eyes is capital. For it bears \non the dimension of testimony in general. Who testi\ufb01 es about what and \nwhom? Who proves, who looks, who observes whom and what? What \nabout knowl edge, certainty, and truth? \u201cLet us observe in parentheses,\u201d \nsays Lacan, \u201cthat this Other distinguished as place of Speech, imposes it-\nself no less as witness of Truth.

Recall what we were saying about Machiavelli, \nabout the prince and the fox, and about the fox that feigns not being the \nfox that it is or even that it is imitating. I am not a fox, the prince can say, \nbasically, the prince who is not really a fox but who is acting like a fox, \nwho knows how to feign being a fox all the while feigning not to feign and \ntherefore not to be the fox that he basically is in what he says or does. Lacan \nwould say that only a prince or a man is capable of this, not a fox. A clean \ndistinction between what Lacan says the animal is able to do, i.e. strategic \nfeint (following, chasing, or persecuting, be it warlike, predatory, or seduc-\ntive), and what it is unable to do and testify to, namely the trickery of speech \nin the order of the signi\ufb01 er and of Truth. The trickery of speech, as we \nshall see, is of course the lie (and the animal cannot really lie, according to \ncommon sense, according to Lacan and many others, even if, as we know, it \nknows how to feign); but, more precisely, trickery is lying insofar as it com-\nprises, in promising the truth, the supplementary possibility of speaking the \ntruth in order to mislead the other, to make the other believe something \nother than the truth (you know the Jewish joke told by Freud and often \n40.

According to Lacan, it is this lie, this \ntrickery, this  second- degree feint that the animal is unable to do, whereas \nthe \u201csubject of the signi\ufb01 er,\u201d in the human order, supposedly has the power \nto do so and, moreover, supposedly comes into being as a subject, institutes \nand comes to itself as sovereign subject by virtue of this power: a re\ufb02 exive \n second- degree power, a conscious power of trickery through feigning to \nfeign. One of the interesting things about this analysis is that Lacan really \ndoes concede a lot, this time \u2014 more in any case than anyone in philos-\nophy and more than he himself had done in earlier writings \u2014 to this abil-\nity to feign on the part of what he always calls \u201cthe animal,\u201d \u201can animal,\u201d \non the part of what he terms here its \u201cdancity,\u201d with an \u201ca.\u201d41 \u201cDancity\u201d is \nthe ability to feign in dance, lure, display, in the choreography of hunting \nor seduction, in the display shown before making love or to defend oneself \nwhen making war, and so in all the forms of the \u201cI am\u201d or \u201cI am followed\u201d \nthat we are tracking here. But whatever he concedes to the animal in this \nway, Lacan holds it in the imaginary or the presymbolic (as we noted in his \n\u201cMirror- Stage\u201d period and in the example of the pigeon or the desert lo-\ncust). He holds \u201cthe animal\u201d prisoner in the specularity of the imaginary; or \nrather he holds that the animal holds itself in this captivity and speaks with \nreference to it of \u201cimaginary capture.\u201d Above all, he holds the animal down \nto the \ufb01 rst degree of feigning (feigning without feigning feigning) or, what \ncomes to the same thing here, to the \ufb01 rst degree of the trace: ability to trace, \ntrack, track down [d\u00e9pister], but not to throw the tracking off track [d\u00e9- pister \nle d\u00e9- pistage] and to efface its track.\nFor a \u201cBut\u201d will indeed fold this paragraph in two (\u201cBut an animal does not \nfeign feigning\u201d). An accounting separates out the columns of what must be \nconceded to the animal (feint and trace, the inscription of the trace) and what \nmust be denied it (trickery, lying, the feint of the feint, and the effacement \nof the trace). But \u2014 what the articulation of this \u201cBut\u201d perhaps leaves out \nof sight, discreetly in the shade, among all the features listed, is perhaps the \nreference to life, to the \u201cvital.\u201d And it is indeed the question of life that is oc-\ncupying us in this seminar, before all and after all, between the beast and the \nsovereign. Everything conceded to the animal is done so under the heading \nof \u201cvital situations,\u201d whereas \u2014 one would be tempted to conclude \u2014 the \nanimal, be it hunter or game, is deemed be incapable of an authentic rela-\n41.

The supposedly established difference \nbetween pister and d\u00e9pister, or rather between d\u00e9pister (to trace or follow a trail) and d\u00e9-\npister (to erase a trail or voluntarily lead the follower astray), gathers and guarantees the \nwhole distinction between human and animal according to Lacan.

Especially when the oppositional distinction between the imaginary \nand the symbolic, which forms the very axiomatics of this discourse on the \nanimal, seems to be increasingly left to one side, if not rejected, by Lacan. \nAs always, I am trying to take into account the strongest systematic orga-\nnization of a discourse in the form in which it gathers itself at a relatively \ndeterminable moment of its process. Spanning thirty years, the various texts \ngathered in one volume, the \u00c9crits, strongly bound to itself, give us in this \nrespect a reliable hold and path to follow. Among the published and acces-\nsible texts that follow the \u00c9crits, one should, in particular, try to follow the \npath that leads, interestingly but I believe without a break, to the analyses \nof animal mimeticism, for example, always from the point of view of view, \nfrom that of the image and the \u201cseeing oneself looked at,\u201d even by a can of \nsardines that can\u2019t see me (\u201cFirst, if it means anything when Petit- Jean says \nbrought to bear on the parricidal brothers according to the logic of Totem and Taboo. \nIn many places, Lacan certainly dreams of an other fraternity, for example in these \ufb01 nal \nwords of \u201cAggressivity in Psychoanalysis\u201d: \u201cIt is to this being of nothingness that it is \nour daily task to open anew the way of his meaning in a discreet fraternity to which we \nnever measure up\u201d (\u00c9crits, p. 124 [p. 101]).\n178 \n"

The animal can trace, inscribe, or \nleave tracks, but, Lacan adds, it \u201cdoes not efface its tracks, which would \nalready mean that it became the subject of the signi\ufb01 er.\u201d Now here too, \neven supposing that we rely on this distinction, Lacan justi\ufb01 es neither by \ntestimony nor by ethological knowledge the assertion whereby \u201cthe ani-\nmal,\u201d as he says, the animal in general, does not efface its tracks. Beyond \nthe fact that, as I had tried to show elsewhere (and this is why, so long ago, \nI had substituted the concept of trace for that of signi\ufb01 er), the structure of \nthe trace presupposes that to trace comes down to effacing a trace as much \nas imprinting it, all sorts of animal practices, sometimes ritual practices, for \nexample in burial and mourning, associate the experience of the trace and \nthat of the effacing of the trace. A feint, moreover, and even a simple feint, \nconsists in rendering a sensory trace unreadable or imperceptible. How \ncould one deny that the simple substitution of one trace for another, the \nmarking of their diacritical difference in the most elementary inscription, \nthe one Lacan concedes to the animal, involves effacement as much as im-\nprinting? It is just as dif\ufb01 cult to assign a frontier between feint and feigned \nfeint, to draw an indivisible line through the middle of a feigned feint, as it \nis to distinguish inscription from effacement of the trace.\nBut let us go further, and ask a type of question that I should have liked, \ngiven time, to generalize. It is less a matter of wondering whether one has \nthe right to refuse the animal such and such a power (speech, reason, experi-\nence of death, mourning, culture, institution, politics, technique, clothing, \nlying, feigned feint, effacement of the trace, gift, laughter, tears, respect, \netc. \u2014 the list is necessarily inde\ufb01 nite, and the most powerful philosophi-\ncal tradition in which we live has refused all of that to the \u201canimal\u201d). It is \nmore a matter of wondering whether what one calls man has the right, for \nhis own part, to attribute in all rigor to man, to attribute to himself, then, \nwhat he refuses to the animal, and whether he ever has a concept of it that \nis pure, rigorous, indivisible, as such. Thus, even supposing, concesso non dato, \nthat the \u201canimal\u201d is incapable of effacing its traces, by what right should \none concede this power to man, to the \u201csubject of the signi\ufb01 er\u201d? And es-\npecially from a psychoanalytic point of view? Any man may certainly be \nconscious, within a space of doxic phenomenality, of effacing his traces. But \nwho will ever judge the ef\ufb01 cacy of this gesture? Do we need to recall that \nany effaced trace, in consciousness, can leave a trace of its effacement the \n \n182\n"

In it, Lacan shares out praise and \ncriticism.\nOn the one hand, the \u201cCartesian cogito does not fail to recognize\u201d the es-\nsential, namely that consciousness of existence, the sum, is not immanent to \nit but transcendent, and therefore beyond specular or imaginary capture. \nThis comes down to con\ufb01 rming that an animal cogito remains a captive \nof the identi\ufb01 catory image, a situation one could formalize by saying that \nthe animal accedes to the ego, the \u201cme,\u201d only by missing the \u201cI,\u201d but an \u201cI\u201d \nthat itself accedes to the signi\ufb01 er only on the basis of a lack: the (animal) self \nlacks the lack. Lacan writes, for example:\nThe ego is thenceforth a function of mastery, a play at being imposing, a \nconstituted rivalry [so many features that are not refused to the animal]. In \nthe capture that it undergoes from its imaginary nature, it masks its duplic-\nity, i.e. that the consciousness in which it assures itself of an incontestable \nexistence (a na\u00efvet\u00e9 to be found deployed in the meditation of a F\u00e9nelon) \nis in no way immanent to it, but indeed transcendent since it sustains itself \non the basis of the unary trait of the ego- ideal (which the Cartesian cogito \ndoes not fail to realize). Whereby the transcendental ego itself is relativ-\nized, implicated as it is in the misrecognition in which are inaugurated the \nidenti\ufb01 cations of the ego.55\nBut, on the other hand, the ego cogito is dislodged from its position as central \nsubject. It loses mastery, central power, and becomes a subject subjected to \nthe signi\ufb01 er.\nThe imaginary process moves thus from the specular image to \u201cthe \nconstitution of the ego on the road of subjectivation by the signi\ufb01 er.\u201d This \nseems to con\ufb01 rm that the  becoming- subject of the ego passes via the sig-\nni\ufb01 er, Speech, the Truth, etc., i.e. by losing immediate transparency, con-\nsciousness as consciousness of a self- identical self. Which leads to an only \napparent paradox: the subject is con\ufb01 rmed in the eminence of its power by \nsubverting it and bringing it back to its defect, namely that animality is on \nthe side of the conscious ego, whereas the humanity of the human subject is \non the side of the unconscious, the law of the signi\ufb01 er, Speech, the feigned \nfeint, etc.:\nThe promotion of consciousness as essential to the subject in the historical \naftermath of the Cartesian cogito is for us the misleading accentuation of \nthe transparency of the \u201cI\u201d in actu at the expense of the opacity of the signi-\n55. \u201cSubversion of the Subject . . . ,\u201d p. 809 [p. 685].\n \n184\n"

And this active, symptomatic misrecognition \nis a piece of bad treatment, even a violent and cruel mistreatment of the \n becoming- animal of man and child, a cruel violence]. They massacred the \n becoming- animal, in the adult and in the child. They saw nothing. In the ani-\nmal, they see a representative of the drives or a representation of the par-\nents.

I refer you to this \nwhole chapter from which I must content myself with reading the opening \nsentences and the conclusion, an indictment of Freud, who is basically ac-\ncused of not believing in what he said, which also constitutes a machine in \nwhich he is hypocritical enough to pretend to believe, but accused of having \ndone everything (and here the condemnation is ethical and even political), \ndone everything, then, to make the patient believe what psychoanalysis was \ntelling him and wanted to have him subscribe to. Have him sign with an-\nother name, a name other than his own, his name turned into the name of \nanother, the name of the father, patronymic, just when he wasn\u2019t that, just \nwhen the new name, the  brand- new name he\u2019d made for himself, was basi-\ncally stolen from him, so that we are dealing with nothing less than a theft \nand the substitution of someone\u2019s name by psychoanalysis (a dispossession \nthat calls up from Deleuze a complaint made against psychoanalysis in the \nname of the Wolf Man, in a style and with a logic of complaint and coun-\nterindictment that is not far from resembling Artaud\u2019s complaint about the \ntheft of his proper, his proper name, his new proper name, and his body \nproper \u2014 supposed to be without organs). Which signi\ufb01 es that these b\u00ea tises \nof psychoanalysis are not only poverties of knowledge, nonknowledges or \nincomprehensions, but ethical violences, machines in turn, and machines \nof war, subjection, brutalization, ways of making patients more b\u00eates, more \nbrutal or brutish than they are in truth. Hence the sarcastic opening of the \nchapter entitled \u201c1914: One or Several Wolves.\u201d As there is a date, the open-\ning is that of a narrative, a chronicle of events, the analysis of the Wolf Man \nby Freud at the time:\n11.

He knew that \nFreud had a genius for brushing against the truth and missing it, then for \n\ufb01 lling the gap with associations. He knew that Freud knew nothing about \nwolves, or about anuses for that matter. Freud only understood what a dog \nwas, and a dog\u2019s tail [no doubt an allusion to the well- known dogs of the \npsychoanalysts Freud and Lacan, whose name before long will be included \nin the genealogical series]. It wasn\u2019t enough; it wouldn\u2019t be enough. The \nWolf Man knew that Freud would soon declare him cured but that it was \nnot so and that he would continue being treated for eternity by Ruth, by \nLacan, by Leclaire. He knew, \ufb01 nally, that he was in the process of acquiring \na true proper name, Wolf Man, much more proper than his own, since he \nwas gaining access to the highest singularity in the instantaneous apprehen-\nsion of a generic multiplicity: wolves \u2014 but that this new true proper name \nwas going to be dis\ufb01 gured, misspelled, retranscribed as a patronymic.12\n(About this disorthographical violence, and be it said in parentheses for the \n\ufb02 avor of the French and Parisian anecdote, and what was to follow under \nLacan, of whom Deleuze had just said that he inherited and was to increase \nFreud\u2019s capital of b\u00ea tises in the violent psychoanalytic domestication and \npaternalization of the Wolf Man and what concerns him, allow me to recall \nthat a few years before Mille plateaux, in 1975, if memory serves, when I \nhad just published a long preface, \u201cFors\u201d to the book that Abraham and \nTorok devoted to the Wolf Man,13 Lacan had dared to say, in an aggressive \nseminar that never has been and no doubt never will be published, that he \nbelieved that I was in analysis with the authors of The Wolf Man\u2019s Magic \nWord and that, in my analysis with them, the subject supposed to know that \nLacan believed himself to be and who though he knew beyond what he was \nsupposed to know \u2014 Lacan said that I \u201ccoupled\u201d them, these two analyst \nfriends.

At bottom, I shall try later to say \nlater why and in what way, in my view we will never manage to isolate \na univocal meaning of the concept of b\u00ea tise, in its irreducible link to the \nFrench language. If it is indeed a category, b\u00ea tise, both an accusation and an \nattribution, an attribute, a predicate, a predication, and if this category does \nnot belong to the regime or the normal series of categories, if it is indeed an \nexceptional and transcategorial category, then it really does answer to the \n\ufb01 rst literal de\ufb01 nition of the transcendental in the Middle Ages, well before \nKant: \u201cqui transcendit omne genus,\u201d a category that transcends all categories \nand thus does not belong to the series or table of categories. B\u00ea tise would \nhere be in the position of a transcategorial category, a transcendental or, as \nI would say, a  quasi- transcendental. And we should have to draw all the \nconsequences from this.\nTo which I shall add, since I have just used the word \u201ccategorial\u201d and \nbecause the word \u201ccategorial\u201d is also the word that Heidegger uses, in Sein \nund Zeit, to designate the concepts that concern the ontological structures \nof the entity that is not Dasein, i.e. Vorhandensein and Zuhandensein (Hei-\ndegger calls <what concerns> the analysis and the concepts that refer to \nDasein \u201cexistentiell\u201d and not \u201ccategorial\u201d) \u2014 to which I shall add that one \ncould, without it being unduly arti\ufb01 cial, wonder whether the analysis of \nb\u00ea tise, as a predicate of man or Dasein but referring (in French at least) to \nsomething nonhuman (the beast), whether the analysis of this unstable and \nambiguous signi\ufb01 cation, of this structure both human and inhuman, comes \nunder the categorical or the existentiell. Obviously, Heidegger never even \ndreamed of proposing an ontological analysis of b\u00ea tise, and no one will be \nsurprised at that, but we will soon rediscover the use (categorical, i.e. accu-\nsatory, in truth autoaccusatory) he made of a word that is often translated, \nrightly or wrongly, by b\u00ea tise, namely Dummheit.

Deleuze\u2019s gesture remains, however, spe-\nci\ufb01 c, and to follow the reasoning that leads him to say that b\u00ea tise, as proper \nto man, is never that of someone else, we can follow a trajectory that has \nhim associate b\u00ea tise with three motifs that interest us here more especially:\n1. The \ufb01 gure of sovereignty called \u201ctyranny\u201d (remember the text from \nthe Republic about the tyrant and the wolf, which we were discussing at the \nvery beginning);\n2. Cruelty (cruel bestiality, which we were talking about last week and \nhave been for years in this seminar);\n3. Finally, and indispensably for attributing b\u00ea tise to man, and under-\nstanding the link with philosophy, b\u00ea tise as a matter of thought and of the \nthinking being that man is (it being understood that animal or beast is not \nsuch a thinking being). B\u00ea tise is a thinking, b\u00ea tise is thoughtful, a thinking \nand thoughtful freedom. It is in this link of thought and individuation that \nDeleuze is about to uncover the mainspring of b\u00ea tise, which always presup-\nposes a relation with what he calls the ground, in the tradition of Schelling, \nwhom he cites in a note,18 Schelling the author of the Philosophical Investi-\n18.

How does one recognize a haunting? With \nwhat signs? Positive, negative? Denegative? Presence of symptoms? Ab-\nsence of symptoms? Explicit or implicit thematization? To what extent, \netc.? (Read and comment)\nCowardice, cruelty, baseness, b\u00ea tise are not simply bodily powers or facts \nof character or society, but structures of thought as such. The landscape \nof the transcendental livens up: we must put into it the place of the tyrant, \nthe slave and the imbecile \u2014 without the place resembling the one who oc-\ncupies it, and without the transcendental ever being transferred onto the \nempirical \ufb01 gures that it makes possible. What prevents one from making \nb\u00ea tise into a transcendental problem is always our belief in the postulates \nof the Cogitatio: b\u00ea tise can no longer be other than an empirical determina-\ntion, referring to psychology or the anecdotal \u2014 worse still, to polemics and \ninsults \u2014 and to sottisiers as a particularly execrable pseudoliterary genre. \nBut whose fault is it? Is the fault not \ufb01 rst of all that of philosophy, which \nallowed itself to be convinced by the concept of error, even if it borrows that \nconcept itself from facts, but from not very meaningful and highly arbitrary \nfacts? The worst literature makes sottisiers: but the best was haunted by the \nproblem of b\u00ea tise, which it managed to bring to the gates of philosophy, by \ngiving it its full cosmic, encyclopedic, and gnoseological dimension (Flau-\nbert, Baudelaire, Bloy). It would have suf\ufb01 ced that philosophy take up this \nproblem [of b\u00ea tise] again with its own means and with all necessary mod-\nesty, considering that b\u00ea tise is never that of the other, but the object of a \nproperly transcendental question: how is b\u00ea tise (and not error) possible?31\nB. On the other hand, saying that b\u00ea tise is never that of someone else does \nnot only mean that it is always reserved for my fellow as a human being. \nIt also means that \u201cI,\u201d \u201cmyself,\u201d as philosopher, theorist or not, always run \nthe risk of having to attribute to myself the b\u00ea tise I\u2019m talking about or that, \ndogmatically, b\u00eatement, I think I recognize in others.

But this track may gradually lead us toward places that are no \nlonger exactly those of Deleuze.\nAs to the b\u00ea tise that can always be mine, and not that of someone else, \nand which, like the category of accusation, can always betray my fault, my \nfailing, evil, or illness, the defect from which I suffer, well, it would \ufb01 rst be \nnecessary to take into account, perhaps, a kind of contagion of b\u00ea tise, a mi-\nmeticism of b\u00ea tise, which should make us wonder where it comes from and \nwhich engenders b\u00ea tise in the very gaze, in the sustained attention, study, \nor re\ufb02 ection, the very knowledge we devote to b\u00ea tise: as though speaking \nof \u201cthe\u201d b\u00ea tise, claiming to know its essence and its meaning, assuming that \nthere is something like \u201cthe\u201d b\u00ea tise, is already a sign of b\u00ea tise. And then, to \nspeak of contagion is to recognize \u2014 a very important point \u2014 that one is \nnever b\u00eate all on one\u2019s own and by oneself, that b\u00ea tise, b\u00ea tises in the plural, if \nsuch there be, are from the start phenomena of  being- with or, if you prefer, \nof the community, intersubjectivity, Mitsein, the socius, as you will. There \nhave to be several of you at it. You have to speak or, if like me you have \ndoubts about the authority of human speech in this domain as in others, let\u2019s \nsay: there has to be some trace. One is never b\u00eate on one\u2019s own, that\u2019s how it \nis, even if this excuses or exonerates nobody. Flaubert doesn\u2019t say it this way, \nbut it seems to me he allows us to think it, at the very point of symptom that \nhe admits to, when he writes the following (it is a passage from the Nota \nBene to Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet that I quote in an old article on Flaubert, \u201cUne \nid\u00e9e de Flaubert,\u201d32 in which I approach in my own way this problem of \nthe relations between b\u00ea tise and philosophy): [Flaubert, then, writes the fol-\nlowing:] \u201cBouvard and P\u00e9cuchet \ufb01 ll me up to the point that I have become \nthem!

It is of the nature of granite, hard and \nresistant.\u201d And the signi\ufb01 cant example that Flaubert immediately gives is \nprecisely not the name of the work but the name of the author, the signa-\ntory of the work thus b\u00eati\ufb01 ed in his monument, in his monumentalization, \nbetween the what and the who, in the equivocal  becoming- what of the who \nstill a who, between man, animal, and earth, between the living thing and \nthe lifeless thing:\nB\u00ea tise is something unshakable: nothing can attack it without breaking \nagainst it. It is of the nature of granite, hard and resistant. In Alexandria, \na certain Thompson, from Sunderland, has written his name in letters six \nfeet tall on the Pompey column [. . .] There is no way of seeing the column \nwithout seeing the name of Thompson and consequently without thinking \nof Thompson.

These reasons, which are heterogeneous \namong themselves, these many reasons, do not only concern the relation of \nsigni\ufb01 cations (signi\ufb01 ed or signifying) between languages: they do not only \nhave to do with the fact that it is only in French that the irreducible diffrac-\ntion of all these meanings and all these values of b\u00eate and b\u00ea tise retains an \nat least implicit reference to the animal b\u00eate, a reference one \ufb01 nds nowhere \nelse, that I know of, in the same way.

Why does the question of the b\u00eate so regularly call for fabulous \nresponses and \u201cas if\u201d concepts, quasi- concepts?

His error? No, \nsomething else, more and something other than his error, when he not only \njoined the Nazi party (he remained a member until the end) but assumed \nhis commitment to Nazism in 1933\u201334.

Let me read a long extract from \nAvital Ronell.\nFor the ancient Greeks, stupidity cannot be seen as belonging to the domain \nof the political because it indicates that which lacks politics: it is being- \noutside- the political. In terms of a political anthropology, the Greek ap-\nproximation or anticipation of stupidity would have to be located in the \nprepolitical, in the forgetting of politics.

Dummheit \nretranslated into Greek means a suspension of the political at the very mo-\nment when Heidegger offers one of his minimalist utterances concerning \nhis link to the politics of the Third Reich.\n \nAt this point, it would be prudent to introduce the problem of untrans-\nlatability that will dominate the pages to follow. There was already an inter-\nnal \ufb01 ssuring within the Greek approximations of \u201cstupidity\u201d \u2014 a linguistic \ninstability that could be overcome only by means of considerable rhetori-\ncal violence. On another register, the movement between French, German, \nSpanish, and En glish appropriations of \u201cstupidity\u201d reveals more than the \nmatter of semantic variance. \u201cStupidity\u201d resists transfer into Dumm heit, just \nas it can hardly inhabit the premises of b\u00ea tise, with its attendant zoology, the \nanimals or animality that populate the few but noteworthy discussions of \nstupidity in French.

And here the matter of untranslatability becomes \neven more tricky, if equally fundamental. What would happen if we were \nto translate this avowal of Dummheit according to common usage, as \u201cstu-\npidity\u201d? Would another translation, equally acceptable though less com-\nmon, alter the horizon of meaning? Let us say that Heidegger referred to \nhis \u201cdumbness\u201d of 1934 rather than to his \u201cstupidity.\u201d The date remains the \nsame, but the moral meaning has shifted, taking on another value. This in-\ntralinguistic twister repeats the interlinguistic knot tying up \u201cstupid\u201d with \nb\u00eate. The difference between avowing stupidity and claiming dumbness for \noneself (\u201cThat was dumb\u201d; \u201cI was really dumb in 1934\u201d) is a signi\ufb01 cant one. \nWhile the disclosure of dumbness leaves no recourse or room for argument, \nstupidity is linked to an effect of malice; indeed, it calls for judgment. In \nother words, whereas dumbness might be part of the irreparable facticity of \nexistence, there is an ethics of stupidity, or let us say simply that it calls for \nan ethics.

There is a point of untranslatability, and there is not [ne . . . point] \nuntranslatability. What links the meaning and the syntax in the French us-\nage of the word point is untranslatable, but relatively untranslatable. The \nresponse is always economical, i.e. impure. Point is untranslatable by one \nword when its syntax plays between the point and the negation ne . . . pas, \nbut easily translatable if I devote a page of explanation to it, and then it will \nnot be purely and simply a translation.\nTo sharpen up this question, one must \ufb01 rst bear witness to or take stock \nof the fact that the absence of a general equivalent, namely a univocal con-\n13.

For example, the number, I repeat, the number 2, the objective \nnumber, beyond any language, is an absolutely ideal object, universally in-\ntelligible, and so free, detached, unbound, but the words deux, two, zwei \nare the same only each in its own language: they remain the \u201csame\u201d object \nintended in each language as often as whoever repeats them: but as they \nremain bound to a language, not universal, they are bound, enchained ide-\nalities relatively limited in their ideality or in their process of idealization \nor universalization. Well, the meaning of the words b\u00eate, b\u00ea tise, as mean-\nings of French words, have an ideal meaning, but one bound to the French \nlanguage, and so to French history, culture, and society, and thereby in the \nend, more seriously, always bound to determinate uses and contexts which \nto that extent limit their translatability or universalization, not only from \none language to another but within one language.\nI choose phenomenological vocabulary and Husserlian conceptuality \nto describe this situation because one \ufb01 nds in it this motif of freedom and \ntherefore the correlate of that responsible, free, and sovereign personality \nthat is so often implied to explain to us (for example, as Lacan and Deleuze \ndo close to us, but as has always been done) that cruel bestiality and b\u00ea tise are \nproper to man and cannot be attributed to so- called animal beasts. At bot-\ntom, what Lacan and Deleuze are telling us about bestiality and (transcen-\ndental) b\u00ea tise is that they are reserved for mankind, that they are the proper \nof mankind, that the beasts are incapable of them, that one cannot qualify \nas \u201cbestial\u201d or b\u00eate (b\u00eate in the sense of b\u00ea tise) beasts that have no relation to \nthe law, that they cannot be cruel and responsible, i.e. free and sovereign \n(sovereignty being, even before de\ufb01 ning politically the essence or vocation \nor claim of a sovereign of a  nation- state or a people, the very de\ufb01 nition of \nthe juridical person, as a free and responsible person, able to say or imply \u201cI, \nme,\u201d to posit itself as \u201cI, me\u201d).\nIf, then, the very meaning of the lexicon of b\u00ea tise or  being- b\u00eate, of bestiality \nor b\u00ea tise, cannot be absolutely translatable, as a free ideality without equivo-\ncation, as a semantic object that is pure and independent not only of such \nand such a language but of pragmatic, performative, polemical, or strategic \nand violent contexts, then it seems impossible strictly to reserve them to \nman as sovereign and free.

If meaning remains linked to a determinate situation, a war-\nlike or polemical pragmatics, for example, an engagement and a vital in-\nvestment (of whatever nature: libidinal, hunting, or seductive), to a relation \nof forces, then the distinction between reaction and response (that everyone \nfrom Descartes to Lacan makes the criterion of what is proper to man, of \nhis rationality, freedom, sovereignty, relation to the law) \u2014 this distinction \nloses its rigor and decidability.\nThis is why, without concluding that b\u00ea tise is proper to French, even if \nthe word b\u00ea tise belongs only to the French language (but why, in fact?), I \nalso recalled that we should start out again from the famous statement in \na very French work of our time, Val\u00e9ry\u2019s Monsieur Teste.

Un-\nless one supposes, with Descartes and Kant, not only that the animal cannot \nconstitute itself into an I and a Me, but that anthropology, the essence of \nwhat is proper to man, is circumscribed by the possibility of the \u201cI, Me,\u201d or \neven by the ability to say \u201cMe, I.\u201d That is a question I shall take on immedi-\nately after this. Here is what Deleuze says: (Read and comment)\nNow animals are as it were forearmed against this ground by their explicit \nforms. It is not the same for the I and the Me, undermined by the \ufb01 elds \nof individuation that work on them, defenseless against a rising up of the \nground that holds out to them a distorted or distorting mirror, in which \nall forms, now thought, dissolve. B\u00ea tise is neither the ground nor the indi-\nvidual, but rather this relation in which individuation makes the ground \nrise up without being able to give it form (it rises though the I, penetrating \nto the depths of the possibility of thought, constituting the unrecognized of \nall recognition).16\nThis is to recognize that b\u00ea tise is a thing of the \u201cMe\u201d or the \u201cI,\u201d and is not \nto name something like a form of psychic life (whether one call it ground \nor not) that would not have the \ufb01 gure of \u201cI Me.\u201d Now, without needing to \ngive credit to this or that construction of Freudian metapsychology, one \ncan avoid reducing the whole of psychic or phenomenological experience \nto its egological form, and one can avoid reducing all life of the Ego, all \negological structure, to the conscious self. In psychic or phenomenological \nexperience, in the self- relation of the living being, there is some non- ego, on \nthe one hand, and there is even, Freud would say, some of the Ego that is \nunconscious. If one does not wish to invoke Freud\u2019s authority and discur-\nsivity, it suf\ufb01 ces to admit that the living being is divisible and constituted by \na multiplicity of agencies, forces. and intensities that are sometimes in ten-\nsion or even in contradiction. I am deliberately, in speaking of a differential \nof intensities and forces, using a  Nietzschean- style language more accept-\nable to Deleuze. But you see clearly what is at stake around this ego- logics \nof \u201cI\u201d and \u201cMe.\u201d\nGiven this, not to forget our problem of the beast and the sovereign, if \nthe sovereign is always the agency or a \u201cMe I,\u201d of a subject saying \u201cMe I,\u201d or \n16.

And in these antagonisms made possible, in every \ufb01 nite living \nbeing, by differences of force or intensity, b\u00ea tise is always necessarily on both \nsides, the side of the \u201cwho\u201d and the side of the \u201cwhat,\u201d on the side of the one \nthat manages to posit itself as sovereign, and on the side of what the sover-\neign denounces or attacks as the b\u00ea tise of the other.\nEven if it were saying, sovereignly intelligent, something as stupid as \u201cLa \nb\u00ea tise n\u2019est pas mon fort\u201d \u2014 which has always passed, in French literature, \nuntil now, until this evening, for a supreme manifestation of critical intel-\nligence positing itself and proudly claiming its rights, of the pitiless lucidity \nof the cogito, of a hyperconscious and triumphant intellectualism, whereas \nfor my part I hear in it, perhaps, perhaps another b\u00ea tise, the b\u00ea tise of the self \n[moi], the b\u00ea tise of the self itself, of the conscious self- positing self, b\u00ea tise \nas such, my very b\u00ea tise. Which posits itself, still triumphant, as intelligent, \nwhich is nothing other than the self- con\ufb01 dence and the self- consciousness \nof a vigilance that is non- b\u00eate, not so b\u00eate, inasmuch as it posits itself as such, \ninasmuch as it posits and posits itself, and \ufb01 nds itself. Positing, thesis, the \nthesis of self, the triumph of self- positing, re\ufb02 ects and re\ufb02 ects itself as b\u00ea-\ntise. B\u00ea tise always triumphs, it is always, in the war we are talking about, on \nthe side of the victor. There is a certain Triumph of Life in b\u00ea tise. A certain \ntriumph over which a certain life tries also to triumph. This is why it is \nvital for b\u00ea tise not to \ufb01 nd itself b\u00eate: that would be suicidal.

We may say that Monsieur Teste\u2019s double fait la moue, we \nsee his mouth faire la moue, we see a kind of disgusted grimace accompany \neverything he says. This can go as far as repulsion, aversion, a silent but elo-\nquent manifestation of impotent rejection, sometimes in situations of utter \nextremity. Montaigne says that among the North American Indians, \u201cthe \nprisoner [spits] in the faces of those who kill him and fait la moue at them.26 \nAnd so Monsieur Teste recognizes,27 after having said \u201cI have eaten almost \nevery day,\u201d that \u201cI have touched [on] women.\u201d\nThis man who has sovereignly touched [on] women is the double or \nspokesman of Monsieur Teste, who is not only a man but a husband. And \nthe narrator is not only the double of Monsieur Teste, he presents him-\nself as doubled, tripled, multiplied. Read carefully all that follows, the two \npages before the narrative of the encounter with Monsieur Teste, in par-\nticular what concerns his self- multiplication, this \u201carithmetic\u201d (his word) \nthat counts with self, counts out the self, calculates or tallies up his own \nmultiplicity. For example, in the paragraph that follows the one we have \njust read, and after speaking of something that remains (\u201cwhat could re-\nmain did so\u201d), the narrator tells of the pro\ufb01 t, the saving, the economy that \nhe \ufb01 nds in this arithmetic. This accounting of the self, as you will hear, \nnot only allows him a certain economy of self, a wisdom that allows him \nto tolerate himself and grow old with himself, but also discreetly opens \nthe  quasi- in\ufb01 nite \ufb01 eld of a hyperbolic upping of the ante that gives him \na right and a power superior to sovereignty, superior to that of superior \nmen, more than sovereign, in sum, more than superior, as it were. This \nis a superiority that can no longer restrain itself, both in\ufb01 nitely cunning \nand in\ufb01 nitely b\u00eate. This is in any case how I would interpret the following \nlines: (Read and comment)\nI have retained neither the best nor the worst of these things: what could \nremain remained.\n \nThis arithmetic spares me from being astonished at growing old. I could \nalso tally up the victorious moments of my spirit, and imagine them to be \n26. Montaigne, Essais (Paris: Gallimard, 1950), book 1, chap. 31, p. 251 [my transla-\ntion].\n27.

And this difference between two marionettes \nin the marionette is again one of the sexual differences we have been talking \nabout since the beginning of the seminar.\nLast time I recalled that most often, in our typical representation of the \nmarionette, what insistently came to the fore was the feminine \ufb01 gure of the \nsmall and the young, the little girl, the touching young girl, even the virgin, \nthe Virgin Mary (mariole, mariolette). With the grace, innocence, and spon-\ntaneity that usually go with that.\nBut as you have no doubt already sensed, things are not so simple. In \ntruth, they are less simple than ever. As always when sexual differences \nare in play. (Incidentally, I\u2019ll venture to say to all those who \u2014 often in the \npress, as you know \u2014 speak ironically of people who, like me for example, \nare fond of issuing warnings, saying, \u201cThings are not so simple,\u201d those to \nwhom irony comes easily when they are faced with this systematic warning, \nI believe it\u2019s primarily because they want to hide from themselves, forget or \ndeny something to do with sexual differences. There\u2019s always a clandestine \ndebate raging about sexual differences.) So, as I was saying about the mari-\nonette as little girl or young innocent virgin full of grace, things are not so \nsimple. And if they are not simple, it is because of the equivocality of the \nliving being, precisely, where the living being concentrates, as though into \n25.

The living being is automotive, autonomous, abso-\nlutely spontaneous, sovereignly automotive, and at the same time perfectly \nprogrammed like an automatic re\ufb02 ex. I insist on this paradox to put back \non stage the eminently phallic \ufb01 gure of the marionette, the phallic erection \nthat comes to inhabit, haunt, and double that of the virgin girl. The virgin \ngirl is inhabited by motion, movement, the essentially phallic law of the \nmarionette. What does this mean?\nThe point is not just to say that the marionette is erect, because it is up-\nright, tensed, hard as wood, made of wood (hard, as Madame \u00c9milie Teste \ninsisted, like the hardness of her husband Monsieur Teste, hardness, i.e. \nalso stiffness, rigidity, or again, as in \u201cThe Meridian,\u201d quoting B\u00fcchner: \n\u201cNothing but art and mechanics, nothing but cardboard and springs!\u201d27): \nwe should not only say that the marionette is erect, because it is upright, \ntensed, hard as wood and that it stands on the stage, etc., like an instrument, \na thingamajig [machin], or an operated machine, content to react mechani-\ncally, always a little stif\ufb02 y, to what is mechanically acting on it. Like an actor \ntoo, an actor or a mask, a simulacrum, a substitute actor that is acted as much \nas it acts, operated, hard- wired (as they say about animal behavior) down to \nthe slightest reaction, etc. This is true, of course, and one could go far in this \ndirection of straight and direct erection, and compare the  quasi- mechanical \nautomatism of the marionette machine in the hands of its puppeteer to the \nre\ufb02 ex, one might almost say the re\ufb02 ex and  quasi- automatic reaction of the \nphallic erection, what presents itself as hard, straight, standing, stiff, and \nrigid. And from this facile comparison one could indeed conclude that the \nmarionette is a sort of metaphor or \ufb01 gure, a sort of phallic trope. It makes \nyou think of the phallus, even though it\u2019s sometimes still a girl, and the \ntaste, fascination, modes, and genres that cultivate the marionette or the \nmarionette theater would thus be participating in the cult of the phallus. \nOne could indeed follow things quite a long way down this road.\nBut in truth it is also the very opposite that we now have to recall.

To limit myself provisionally \nto vocabulary, we know that we are going to \ufb01 nd the marionettes again, of \ncourse, more than once, and heads, many heads, monarch\u2019s heads in par-\nticular, and revolutionary decapitations, we know that we are going to \ufb01 nd \nagain the majesty I was just talking about, and above all a Medusa\u2019s head, \nwhich I don\u2019t need to recall \u2014 though I will in a moment \u2014 the apotropaic \nrelation it has (and that Freud recalls in Das Medusenhaupt)28 to petri\ufb01 ed \nerection and the threat of castration.\nHere perhaps, in the comic or derisory aspect of erection, is where the \nexperience of b\u00eatise returns. In what remains comic about it, enough to \nmake you die laughing. One cannot think of the Greek phallus without \nassociating it with Priapus, or even priapism. I note \ufb01 rst that Freud, who \noften speaks of the phallic, the phallic phase, the phallic mother, etc., rarely \nspeaks, in fact almost never, of the phallus itself under this common noun. \nHe uses the adjective \u201cphallic,\u201d and almost never the noun \u201cphallus.\u201d One \nof the very rare occurrences, if not the only exception, is precisely in a his-\ntorical reference to Priapus\u2019s phallus in \u201cThe Taboo of Virginity.\u201d29 To show \nthat people were fearful of the threat that weighed on whoever de\ufb02 owered \ngirls, Freud recalls that in India young wives had \ufb01 rst to sacri\ufb01 ce their hy-\nmen on a wooden lingam (again a kind of marionette) and that this custom \ncan also be found among the Romans. He then mentions Saint Augustine\u2019s \ncomment that the newlywed wife at least had to sit on what Freud calls \u201ca \ngigantic stone phallus of Priapus.\u201d You know that the principal attribute of \nPriapus, who was often held to be the son of Dionysus and Aphrodite or \na nymph, was that he was endowed, even af\ufb02 icted, with an outsize phal-\nlic member, and we must say phallus rather than penis because this penis \nwas outsize precisely because it was, or insofar as it was, uncontrollable by \nthe subject, in permanent and irrepressible erection, that is, ithyphallic as \nit is sometimes called and as one should always call it: the ithyphallos is the \nhardness of the straight, rigid, standing phallus (ithus is straight, inciden-\ntally also in the sense of rectitude).

Terrible (terribilis says Columella in his \nAgriculture, 10.33),30 terrible, terrifying, terrorizing, and comic all at once. \nThere would be a lot to say about this derision, this comic or mocking di-\nmension in the ef\ufb01 gies of the ithyphallic god sometimes daubed with red \nand shouting obscenities. It was said of this quasi- god in constant erection \nthat he was born of an ass and was like an ass. Lactantius tells of a competi-\ntion to see which of the two, Priapus or the ass, has the bigger member. The \nass wins, beats Priapus, but to avenge himself Priapus kills the ass.31 Here, \ninsinuating itself, we see the hypothesis that a mark of b\u00eatise always threat-\nens the presumed superiority of a constant and imperturbable erection. I \nshall call this, very seriously, ithyphallic b\u00eatise, the essential, nonaccidental \nb\u00eatise that characterizes the phallic as such (and so sovereignty as such, of \nwhich the ithyphallic is the attribute). It is like a marionette whose re\ufb02 ex \nspring and uncontrollable automaticity never let up. The ithyphallus is a \nmarionette, whose hyperbolic desire is both nil and empty of thought and of \nits own drive, of course, but it is this void that nonetheless pushes it, pulses \nand compulses it, it is what promises, promotes, and makes one think of a \ndrive that is absolutely b\u00eate, ent\u00eat\u00e9, that never gives anything up, that is an \nabsolute stranger to all thought.\nI am not sure that Aristotle suspected this, but it is he who, intrigued by \nthe phenomenon of erection, worried about what might happen if by mis-\nfortune (and it is this misfortune I am venturing to call b\u00eatise) the erection \nbecame permanent. That would be not only ridiculous and would not only \nmake us laugh, as in the rituals and jokes I have just been talking about, \nbut, says Aristotle (in The Parts of Animals 689a 25\u201327), it would consti-\ntute an unnatural hindrance. Perhaps tolerable for beasts and for demigods, \nthis imperturbable and impassive erection would produce in men only im-\npotence without the emission of semen, and thus without generative power, \nand would produce only pain without enjoyment. The pathology called \npriapism leads to death. And priapism is in\ufb01 nite ithyphallism, ithyphallism \nforeign to that detumescence that is the \ufb01 nitude of erection and that, as such, \nmakes possible the time of erection \u2014 which it threatens, of course, but to \n30. Quoted by Maurice Olender, \u201cPriape, le dernier des dieux,\u201d in Dictionnaire des \nmythologies, 2:312; trans. as \u201cPriapus: The Last of the Gods,\u201d in Mythologies, comp. Yves \nBonnefoy, 1:629. \n31. Handwritten addition: \u201cAs if he had found in the ithyphallic ass something more \nb\u00eate than himself, intolerably more b\u00eate than himself.\u201d\n \n299\n \n300\n"

A priapic, i.e. permanent and inde\ufb01 nite, \nerection is no longer even an erection \u2014 and it is a mortal pathology.\nBut is detumescence castration? Instead of taking on this immense ques-\ntion frontally, it\u2019s time to return to \u201cThe Meridian,\u201d which we have, in fact, \nkept obliquely in view since the beginning of this session. What is said in it \nabout the marionette, about the Medusa\u2019s head, about heads in general, and \nabout majesty allows for a fairly well- justi\ufb01 ed transition. But I should also \nlike to emphasize the Foreigner (Fremde), the Other (Andere), and the famil-\niar or worrying estrangement (Unheimliche). I had to choose between a con-\ntinuous reading of Celan\u2019s \u201cSpeech,\u201d an interpretation that would follow the \napparent order and linear time of the text, its very consecution, and another, \nless diachronic, more systematic reading, which would be concerned, for the \npurposes of demonstration, to bring out a con\ufb01 guration of motifs, words, \nand themes, \ufb01 gures that usually do not appear in this order. I have of course \ntaken this second course, [on the one hand] because we won\u2019t have time to \nread together, in a linear way, the whole text from A to Z (though I recom-\nmend that you do so yourselves), and, on the other hand, because the actively \ninterpretative, selective, and directed reading I am about to propose to you \nrequires it. You understand that I do not hold this interpretative reading to \nbe the only or even the best possible one, but it doesn\u2019t seem impossible, and \nit is important to me in the perspective of this seminar.\nEven before looking (too quickly, of course) at the motifs that I am \nproposing to articulate together (even though Celan does not do so explic-\nitly) \u2014 namely art, the marionette or the automat, the Medusa\u2019s head, heads \nin general, and majesty, the Foreigner, and the Unheimliche \u2014 I have two \npreliminary remarks.\nFirst preliminary remark. There is a lot about dates in this text, which is \nalso a sort of poetics of the date. When I devoted a little book to it some \ufb01 f-\nteen years ago (Schibboleth),32 I made it into a privileged object of re\ufb02 ection \nand analysis or interpretation, especially around a certain January 20 that \nrecurs regularly, at least three times, in the text (B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz, \u201cthe Lenz \nwho \u2018on January 20 was walking through the mountains,\u2019 \u201d33 then \u201cPerhaps \nwe can say that every poem keeps inscribed within it its \u2018January 20,\u2019 \u201d34 then \n32.

But it is thanks \nto Jean Launay\u2019s edition (so precious and exemplary, as I have said) that \nI was able to discover a further import to this \u201cJanuary 20.\u201d Referring to \nCelan\u2019s manuscript, Launay tells us in a note36 that \u201cJanuary 20 is also the \nday in 1942 of the so- called Wannsee conference in Berlin, during which \nHitler and his collaborators drew up the plans for the \u2018\ufb01 nal solution.\u2019 \u201d And \nhere is the translation of the passage from Celan\u2019s manuscript: \u201cWe are still \nwriting, still today, January 20 \u2014 this January 20 [this underlined, \u2018diesen \n20, J\u00e4nner\u2019], to which has been added since then the writing of so much \n[so many days of] ice\u201d (\u201czu dem sich [seitdem] soviel Eisiges hinzugeschrieben \nhat\u201d). \u201cJanuary 20,\u201d an anniversary of death, then, of crime against human-\nity, of a sovereignly, arbitrarily genocidal decision. \u201cJanuary 20,\u201d the eve \nof the anniversary of the decapitation of the monarch, Louis XVI, about \nwhom a lot is said, between the repetitions of \u201cLong live the King\u201d of Lucile \nand Lenz, to which we shall return.\nSecond preliminary remark. The apparently surprising contiguity between \nour readings of Monsieur Teste and \u201cThe Meridian,\u201d texts that are, how-\never, so different, so distant through so many features \u2014 this contiguity or \nproximity of two texts that are apparently so anachronistic with respect to \neach other is justi\ufb01 ed not only, beyond mere juxtaposition, by the fact that \nthey both, each in its own way, treat of the marionette and everything that \nis attached to it. The fact is that Val\u00e9ry is not simply absent from \u201cThe \nMeridian.\u201d Celan wonders at a certain moment, on the subject of a radical \nquestioning of art, if one must not \u201cthink Mallarm\u00e9 through to his ultimate \nconsequences?\u201d (\u201cMallarm\u00e9 konsequent zu Ende denken?\u201d). Here too a long \nnote by Launay37 puts us on the track of a manuscript of Celan\u2019s that refers \nto a passage by Val\u00e9ry in Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s. Here, Val\u00e9ry quotes something Mallarm\u00e9 \nsaid to poor Degas, who was complaining about not \ufb01 nishing his little poem \nwhen he was \u201cfull of ideas.\u201d Mallarm\u00e9, as Val\u00e9ry reports, replied: \u201cBut De-\ngas, it is not with ideas that poetry is made, but with words.\u201d And Val\u00e9ry \nconcludes: \u201cThat is a great lesson.\u201d38\nLet us now try, around or through the con\ufb01 guration I have announced \n35.

You know that the concept of encounter, the \u201csecret of the encoun-\nter\u201d we were just talking about (Geheimnis der Begegnung), is the secret of \nthe poem, of the presence or the putting into presence or the presentation \nof the poem, the secret of the encounter as secret of the poem in the double \nsense of the term \u201csecret of\u201d: in the sense of what, on the one hand, \ufb01 rst, \nmakes a poem, in the sense of its manufacture, its making, its possibility of \ntaking form, if not of its art and its know- how, I prefer to say its signature \n(that is, the secret as genesis of the poem, its condition of possibility, as when \nwe say, \u201cThat guy has the secret,\u201d implying the art of something or other, \nthough here it is not essentially art that holds the secret of this act or rather \nthis event, it is the encounter) and then \u2014 the double sense of secret \u2014 on \nthe other hand, secondly, as what in the present itself \u2014 in the very presenta-\ntion of the poem, in this present now on which Celan insists so much, in the \nexperience of the encounter \u2014 still remains secret, at bottom like a present \nthat does not present itself, a phenomenon that does not phenomenalize \nitself. Nothing shows up, the nothing, the absurd shows up in manifesting \nnothing.

Insist on this \u201cmore,\u201d and the void.)43\nBut then, why keep the word?\nWhat counts most here, with Celan, is that this hypermajesty of poetry, \nbeyond or outside the majesty of the king, the sovereign, or the monarch, \nthis supreme majesty of the absurd, as majesty of Dichtung, is determined \nby four equally serious values, among which I believe we must still privilege \none, or rather recognize among them the privilege of one only, and it is that \nof the present (Gegenwart). These four serious values or meanings are that \nof testimony, of course; that of majesty insofar as it bears witness (zeugenden \nMajest\u00e4t); that of the human for which it bears witness; but above all, in my \nview, because it is continually con\ufb01 rmed and repeated, that of the present \n(\u201cGehuldigt wird hier der f\u00fcr die Gegenwart des Menschlichen zeugenden Ma-\njest\u00e4t des Absurden\u201d). Majesty is here majestic, and it is poetry, insofar as it \nbears witness to the present, the now, the \u201cpresence,\u201d as Launay translates \nit, of the human. Just as to bear witness is always to perform an act of pres-\nence, through speech addressed to the other, attesting to a presence, so what \ncounts here, and what signs, is a presence attesting to a presence or rather \nto a present, qua human.\nI would not privilege to this extent the present, the presence of this pres-\nent, if, beyond all the reasons you easily imagine, Celan himself did not \nreturn to it with an insistence that is obvious and, I believe, undeniable. I \nshall be briefer, for lack of time today, on the other two promised examples \nor returns.\nSecond return. Around ten pages later, after a trajectory that I cannot \nreconstitute but from which we\u2019ll follow a few essential stages next time, \nCelan says this about what he calls \u201clanguage actualized\u201d (aktualisierte \nSprache), under the sign of a \u201cradical individuation\u201d: he says this, then, add-\ning the present to the now, making Gegenwart more serious with Pr\u00e4senz:\nThen the poem would be \u2014 even more clearly than before \u2014 the language \nof an individual which has taken on form; and, in keeping with its inner-\nmost nature, it would also be the present, the here and now.

He speci\ufb01 es that this now- present of the poem, my now- present, the \npunctual now- present of a punctual I, my now- present must allow the now-\n present of the other, the time of the other, to speak. It must leave time, give \ntime to the other.\nTo the other, it must leave or give its time. Its own time.\nTo the other, it must leave or give its time. To the other, it must leave or \ngive its own time. This formulation is not literally Celan\u2019s, but I imprint \non it this ambiguous or even unheimlich grammar, in which we no lon-\nger know to whom the possessive adjective belongs, to self or other (to the \nother, leave or give its time), I give or leave it this grammatical equivocity to \ntranslate what I believe to be the truth of what Celan is saying: to the other, \nleave or give its own time.\nWhich of course introduces into the now- present a divisibility or an al-\nterity that changes everything. It gives over to a total rereading of the pre-\ndominant authority, even of the majesty of the present, that becomes that of \nthe other or that of a dissymmetrical division with the other, turned toward \nthe other or come from the other.

Do not forget that \ndolphin, delphis in Greek, delphinus in Latin, is \ufb01 rst of all the name given \nby man to that other great [gros et grand] animal, that carnivorous cetacean \nwhose blubber furnishes a precious oil (delphinus delphis) and which passes \nfor being so close to man, so benevolent and friendly a matter toward us \nthat La Fontaine, who dedicated his Fables to \u201cMonseigneur le Dauphin,\u201d \nwrote its eulogy: he praised the animal, did La Fontaine, an animal not so \nb\u00eate, as you\u2019ll see, and an animal friendly to man, in a fable I\u2019m going to \nread to you, after recalling that the French title \u201cDauphin,\u201d used to desig-\nnate the king\u2019s son and thus the heir to the throne, has a very French, purely \nFrench history, as in the calendar of the monarchy and the revolution we \nare interested in at the moment. Dauphin was originally a name borne by \nthe lords of the French province of the Viennois at the time the Dauphin\u00e9 \nwas ceded to the king of France. Now the proper name at the origin of \nthe Dauphin\u00e9 was Delphinus, the name of the \ufb01 sh, quite simply because \nthe lords had chosen three dolphins to \ufb01 gure on their coat of arms. Which \nmeans, if one interprets this heraldic symbolism as a sort of totemic effect, \nthat the title Dauphin for the elder son and royal heir is, at least by a drift \ntoward a royal beach, a totemic title. If now I read in extenso the fable of La \nFontaine entitled The Monkey and the Dolphin, it\u2019s not merely because of \nthe irony whereby the subject citizen La Fontaine dedicates all his fables \nto his virtual sovereign, Monseigneur le Dauphin. It is for many other rea-\nsons: for if all the animals in the fables are anthropomorphic \ufb01 gures, and \nin one way or another human \ufb01 gures, as positive or negative heroes, here \nthe animal is not only human like all the others but embodies, among the \nhuman animals, among animals in human form, among the anthropoids in \nthe broad sense of this word, one of those that are naturally more human \nand above all friendly to man, \u201ca strong friend of our species,\u201d as the fable \nsays. And then there is the monkey, the other hero of the fable. The mon-\nkey is not just any animal, in our problematic and among the animals that \n341 \n342 \n"

For in German, \u201csecret\u201d is Geheimnis (the intimate, \nthe folded back on itself, what has withdrawn in withdrawal, the hidden \ninside of the house and home), and this secret of the encounter is at the most \nintimate heart of what is present and presence (Gegenwart und Pr\u00e4senz) in \nthe poem.\nThen the poem would be \u2014 even more clearly than before \u2014 the language \nof an individual which has taken on form; and, in keeping with its inner-\nmost nature, it would also be the present, the here and now.

In this very \nplace, a few years ago, I emphasized the decisive importance (scarcely no-\nticed, if at all) of the vocabulary of the Unheimliche and of Unheimlichkeit in \nHeidegger (an importance as great as in Freud, though at least apparently \ndifferent).13 Now without wanting nor being able to reopen wide the ques-\ntion of the Unheimliche in Heidegger, from Sein und Zeit up to the end, I \nshall content myself with pointing out \u2014 precisely because it has to do with \nthe human and the inhuman \u2014 a passage from the Introduction to Meta-\nphysics (1935), which resonates strangely (unheimlich) with what Celan says \nabout the Unheimliche as what at home in art seems to exceed the human in \nthe human, seems to step outside the human in human art.\nI reopen the Introduction to Metaphysics rather violently, guided by what \nmatters to us at the moment, at the point where Heidegger relaunches the \nquestion \u201cWhat is man?\u201d14 Let me put down a couple of essential mark-\ners before coming on to what interests us here in this journey, namely the \nUnheimliche.\n1. First marker. Heidegger begins by asserting the secondary character, the \nfundamentally derived, late- on- the- scene, and (from the ontological point \nof view) fundamentally very unsatisfactory character of a de\ufb01 nition of man \nas animal rationale or as zo\u00afon logon ekhon. Incidentally, he interestingly and \nunassailably calls this de\ufb01 nition \u201czoological,\u201d not only but also in the sense \nthat it links the logos to the zo\u00afon and claims to render account and reason \n(lo gon di donai) of the essence of man by saying of him that he is \ufb01 rst of all \na \u201cliving thing,\u201d an \u201canimal\u201d (\u201cDie genannte De\ufb01 nition des Menschen ist im \nGrunde eine zoologische\u201d).

In other words, so long as one has not \nquestioned ontologically the essence of being alive, the essence of life, it \nremains problematic and obscure to de\ufb01 ne man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon. Now \nit is on this unquestioned basis, this problematical basis of an unelucidated \nontological question of life that the whole of the West, says Heidegger, has \nconstructed its psychology, its ethics, its theory of knowledge, and its an-\nthropology. And Heidegger then describes with irony and a superior air \nthe state of the culture in which we live, in which one can receive books \nbearing on their cover the title What Is Humanity? without even a hint of a \nquestion being asked beyond the cover of such a book, which, he notes (in \n1935), the Frankfurter Zeitung praises for being a book that is \u201cunusual and \ncourageous.\u201d15\n2. Second marker. Henceforth the reply to the question \u201cWhat is man?\u201d can-\nnot be a reply but a question, a questioning, an act and experience of Fra-\ngen, for in this question it is man himself who is determining himself by \nquestioning about himself, about his being, discovering himself in this way \nto be of a questioning essence in the Fragen. From which Heidegger draws \ntwo conclusions in one, namely that \u2014 I\u2019m citing the [French] translation \nthat seems to me not very illuminating and that I shall attempt to clarify \nlater: \u201cIt is only insofar as he comes forth in questioning that man comes \nto himself and is a self\u201d (\u201cDer Mensch kommt erst als  fragend- geschichtlicher \nzu ihm selbst und ist ein Selbst\u201d [comment]). And that therefore this Selbst, \nthis self, this ipseity (as Selbst is translated) that is not yet an \u201cI,\u201d nor an \nindividual, nor a \u201cwe,\u201d nor a community, is a \u201cwho\u201d before any \u201cI,\u201d any in-\ndividual, any person, any \u201cwe,\u201d and any community (a fortiori, I would add \nfor what is of interest to us, nor a subject or a political animal, for Heideg-\nger\u2019s suspicion about man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, animal rationale, would be \nthe same as to man as political animal, an expression of Aristotle\u2019s to which \nwe shall return at length later). So that \u2014 second conclusion wrapped up \nin the \ufb01 rst \u2014 the question of man as to his own being (nach seinem eigenen \nSein) is transformed, is no longer \u201cWhat is man?\u201d What is man? (Was ist der \nMensch?), but \u201cWho is man?\u201d (Wer ist der Mensch?).\nHaving recalled these two markers, you will see, if you reread this text \nas I ask that you do, that Heidegger, provisionally abandoning Parmenides, \nwhom he is reading, and turning to Sophocles\u2019 Antigone16 to look for the po-\netic sketch of what could be the Greek way of listening to the essence of man \n15.

Heidegger himself asks, \u201cWhy do we translate deinon \nas un- heimlich?\u201d19 The principle of his reply is that the sentence (Spruch) that \nsays, \u201cDer Mensch ist das Unheimlichste [deinotaton, then]\u201d (\u201cMan is the most \nun heimlich\u201d) gives the authentic, proper, Greek de\ufb01 nition of man (gibt die \neigentliche griechische De\ufb01 nition des Menschen). Why? Why translate it this \nway? Not to add a meaning after the fact to the word deinon (which is often \ntranslated as \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d), nor because we hear the Unheimliche \nas a sensory impression, as an affect or what makes an impression on our \nsensibility, but because there is in the Unheimliche something that expels us \nfrom the heimliche, from the peaceful quiet of the domestic, the heimisch, \nthe usual (Gewohnten), the current and the familiar (Gel\u00e4u\ufb01 gen). Man is the \nmost unheimlich, because he steps outside the familiar, the habitual frontiers \n(Grenzen) of habit, etc. When the chorus says of man that he is to deinotaton \nor das Unheimlichste, the point for Heidegger is not to say that man is this \nor that, and only then unheimlichste: the point is much more, much earlier \n[bien plut\u00f4t, bien plus t\u00f4t], more originarily, to say that the essence of man, \nwhat is proper to man (his fundamental feature, his Grundzug), is this being \nforeign to everything that one can identify as familiar, recognizable, etc. \nWhat is proper to man would be, basically, this way of not being secure at \nhome (heimisch), even with oneself as with one\u2019s proper essence.

Not to pay homage to \nsome obscurantism of nonknowledge, but to prepare perhaps some poetic \nrevolution in the political revolution, and perhaps too some revolution in \nthe knowledge of knowledge, precisely between the beast, the marionette, \nthe head, the Medusa\u2019s head, and the head of His Majesty the sovereign. \nWhich is no doubt signed by the repetition of the \u201cperhaps\u2019s\u201d and the \u201cwho \nknows\u201d (wer weiss).\nWell, to conclude for today, to mark a provisional punctuation or a few \npoints of suspension in our history or in our fable entitled \u201cThe Beast and the \nSovereign,\u201d to make a signal that is still indeterminate, in waiting, in two di-\nrections, both toward the revolution that de- crowns the majesty, and toward \nseveral ages in the history of knowledge, a knowledge of the living animal \nbeing that objecti\ufb01 es or produces objects for the gaze of the sovereign, be \nthat sovereign a great king or be it the people, here then are two signals to \nend today, two signals we shall have to learn to decipher.

In both cases, the one prerevolutionary, the other postrevolutionary, \nwe are dealing with a political organization of the \ufb01 eld of knowledge, in the \nform of the anatomy lesson or the lesson of natural science.\nI take these two signals, these two reference points, from a book and \nespecially an article that I recommend to you. The book is by Henri F. \nEllenberger, translated into French under the title M\u00e9decines de l\u2019\u00e2me: Essais \nd\u2019histoire de la folie et des gu\u00e9risons psychiques.29 These are texts gathered and \n28.

One of the articles, to which I am now \nreferring, \u201cThe Mental Hospital and the Zoological Garden,\u201d proposes a \nfascinating parallel between these two histories (that of the zoo and that \nof the asylum), especially in France. I shall come back to this next week in \nmore detail. But I wanted today to take from it the two signals or indices \nthat I mentioned above.\nThe \ufb01 rst, the prerevolutionary one, is the one that I placed as an exergue \nat the beginning of this session. It is indeed an anatomy lesson. Following \nvery closely a famous book by Gustave Loisel, Histoire des m\u00e9nageries de \nl\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 \u00e0 nos jours (Paris, 1912, 3 vols.), Ellenberger reconstitutes this dis-\nsection scene and this sort of anatomy lesson objectifying30 the dead body of \na large elephant on the institutional initiative and under the gaze of a great \nsovereign. Here\u2019s the passage from which I took a fragment at the begin-\nning of the session:\nIn his curious work The New Atlantis,31 written between 1614 and 1617, \nFrancis Bacon described an imaginary land where life was dominated by \nthe cult of scienti\ufb01 c research. The parks there contained specimens of all \nthe known animals, which were used in experiments in physiotherapy, in-\ncluding the fabrication of monsters, hybrids, and new species. Here was \nthe foreshadowing of a new trend: the utilization of the zoo for scienti\ufb01 c \nresearch.\n \nIt was in France that this new kind of establishment saw the light of \nday. In 1662 Louis XIV created the Menagerie of Versailles, intended from \nthe outset to be the biggest and most magni\ufb01 cent in the world. Although \nthis was primarily a display establishment reserved for the visits of the king \nand the court in full ceremonial, Louis XIV also made it a research cen-\nter. Upon arrival each animal was painted or represented in miniature by \na known artist. Scienti\ufb01 c exploitation of the menagerie was placed in the \nhands of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, whose members did many animal dis-\nsections and produced the \ufb01 rst important work in comparative anatomy. \nLoisel tells the famous story of the ceremonial dissection of an elephant \nin 1681, an event which the Sun King deigned to honor with his presence: \n\u201cNever perhaps was there a more imposing anatomical dissection, judged \nby the enormity of the animal, by the precision with which its several parts \nwere examined, or by the quality and number of assistants.\u201d But Loisel also \n30. Derrida\u2019s pencil annotation: \u201cObjectifying to death of the object (develop).\u201d\n31.

We have in spite of everything, faced with this scene, this picture im-\nmobilized under the eye of a painter, the striking impression of a hand- to-\n hand combat [un corps \u00e0 corps]. Hand- to- hand between whom and whom, \nwhom and what? First, between two very great bodies, the beast and the \nsovereign, of course. Between two immense living beings \ufb01 rst of all: the \nking of kings, the greatest of kings, Louis le Grand, and the greatest animal. \nNext, this hand- to- hand is a duel, or rather the end, the aftermath, of a duel \n(a warlike duel, perhaps, or unconsciously amorous, therefore narcissistic, \nafter a scene of seduction, hunt, or capture, captation or predation). The \nscienti\ufb01 c scene, the scene of knowledge, takes place in the aftermath, or the \nday after, the defeat of one of the two living beings, on a battle\ufb01 eld but also \n<on> the magnetic \ufb01 eld of a narcissistic attraction that opposed the two \ngreat living beings, the one surviving and the other become cadaveric ob-\n ject at the disposal of the other, at the hand of the other, manipulable by the \nother, captive of the other after having been captured by the great king or \nhis servants, soldiers or merchants, in the course of expeditions.\n2. This scene of knowledge is as phenomenal as the elephant. This is a phe-\nnomenal beast, a phenomenal elephant, i.e. an object that appears, in its \nphainesthai, to the gaze not only of the learned observers but of a Sun King, \na king of light and a source of light, a king who is the condition of pos-\nsibility of appearing and of knowledge, a phenomenological, phenomeno-\n poetical, phenomeno- political king, source and producer of light who, from \nmost high, like Plato\u2019s Good, sun, and agathon, gives being and appearing to \nthings. Here, everything is subject to the Sun King, knowledge, and being, \nand the phenomenal elephant is both subject and object under the king\u2019s \ngaze. The king keeps, owns, has in his possession the immense beast, he \nhas the immense cadaver at his disposal, like an object for his power, for his \nknowledge, for his having and his seeing, and for his pleasure [pour son pou-\nvoir, pour son savoir, pour son avoir et pour son voir, et pour son bon vouloir].\n3. This setup (wanting to have the power to see and to know [vouloir avoir \nle pouvoir de voir et de savoir] \u2014 and you can manipulate this chain in <all> \ndirections), is mediated by institutions. This whole scene of dissection and \n3. Loisel, quoted by Ellenberger in \u201cThe Mental Hospital and the Zoological Gar-\nden,\u201d p. 64. Derrida\u2019s emphasis. \n377 \n378 \n"

To whom it remains very docilely subjected. \nAnd the other institution of the same power is the one that was put in place \nfewer than twenty years before the spectacular and theatrical dissection of \nthe elephenomenelephant, namely the Menagerie of Versailles instituted in \n1662. One thinks of this elephenomenelephant that was no longer looking \nat them but that could have seen them, with its own eyes seen the king see \nit in its own autopsy.\n4. Finally, as I suggested with a quotation last week, the structure of this \nsetup of knowing- power, power- to- know, knowing- how- to- see, and sover-\neign being- able- to- see is not, fundamentally, revolutionized by the French \nRevolution. It is not interrupted, and at the death of the king one can still \nsay: \u201cThe King is dead, long live the King!\u201d One has simply changed sov-\nereigns. The sovereignty of the people or of the nation merely inaugurates \na new form of the same fundamental structure. The walls are destroyed, \nbut the architectural model is not deconstructed \u2014 and will, as you will see, \ncontinue to serve as a model and even as an international model. The de-\nstruction of the menagerie of Versailles is only an episode, a simple trans-\nfer of power, since Bernadin de Saint- Pierre, who was the intendant of the \nKing\u2019s Garden, had the debris transported and proposed that a new estab-\nlishment be founded. I recalled last time that a report was then ordered by \nthe Paris Society for Natural History, and written among others \u2014 which \nas we shall see is far from being insigni\ufb01 cant \u2014 by the alienist Pinel. This \nreport, written at the height of the Revolution, in 1792, concluded:\nA menagerie like those that princes and kings are accustomed to maintain \nis nothing but a costly and unnecessary imitation of Asiatic pomp [we shall \nsee shortly, or next time, why \u201cAsiatic\u201d: the point is, then, for the Revolu-\ntion, to put an end to the luxury and idleness of the rich, which does not \nentail putting an end to the popular curiosity of all, but also to bend to \nEuropean and Western rationality a monarchy that was supposedly merely \naping the Asian despots]; but we think that a menagerie without frills [a \ndemocratic and popular menagerie, then, a popular- democratic menagerie, \nsecular and republican, in conformity with the new sovereignty, that of na-\ntion and people] could be extremely useful to natural history, to physiology \nand to the economy.4\n4.

Which means \nthat, and this is a paradox, by giving the reading or watching subject of \nthe narrative representation the illusion of himself pulling sovereignly the \nstrings of history or of the marionette, the mysti\ufb01 cation of representation is \nconstituted by this simulacrum of a true transfer of sovereignty.

There \nis a point where the symmetry is broken and where sovereignty is marked \nby the power to see, by being- able- to- see without being seen, what I called \nelsewhere, in Spectres of Marx on the subject of Hamlet, the visor- effect.24 \nThe king or the king\u2019s specter sees without his gaze, the origin of his seeing, \nwithout his eyes being seen. Here it is the same thing and Marin does not \nfail to recall this \u201casymmetry\u201d:\nOne would be wrong to think that this position puts in return the king into \nthe position of a seen object. In truth it is the opposite. This position is only \nwhat it is by being under the gaze of the king, in the optical cone of his eye. \n[And Marin gives many references to this all- seeing and panoptical eye of \nthe sovereign, in La Bruy\u00e8re, Racine (in a Discourse given, precisely, at the \nAcad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1685, four years after the autopsy of our elephant), \netc.] The gaze of the \u201cI- one\u201d is the plural, inde\ufb01 nite and nonpersonal eye \nin the sovereign gaze, resplendent sun and fulgurant light [soleil \u00e9clatant et \nlumi\u00e8re \u00e9clat\u00e9e] of His Majesty [you see that the word \u00e9clat bespeaks both \nthe brilliance of the beam [\u00e9clat] that strikes and, also, the ubiquitous dis-\npersion which disperses or only disperses the better to invade everything].25 \nAsymmetrical reciprocity of eyes and gaze, of eyes that see what the king \ndoes, says and thinks, and of the gaze that makes them see what he does, \nsays, and thinks: perfect representation without excess or loss in this play \nof re\ufb02 ections or recognition, in spite of the double polarity of the historical \nagent and the narrator, but which operates its effects only at the price of the \nsimulation of this spectacle.26\nMarin certainly talks of autopsy but not about the working of the anatomy \nlesson with the violent opening up of the body of a living- dead, an animal \nor a man, and especially a dead animal. Marin uses the word autopsy in \nwhat is indeed its original sense, the \u201cseeing by oneself,\u201d inspecting with \none\u2019s own eyes. That\u2019s what autopsia originally means: the experience that \nconsists in seeing with one\u2019s own eyes, and thus of being able to bear wit-\nness (and this is the sense to which Marin limits himself when he says that \nPellisson is inspired by the \u201cancient demand of autopsy as guarantee of the \n24.

A rare meaning, that of a participation in the all- powerfulness of the \ngods and an intimate commerce with them;\n2.

This dead ele-\nphant, put to death or held at bay, because of being dead, by the king, is also \nto some extent, in this necropsy, the denied, averted, vaguely totemic rep-\nresentation of the dead king, the mortal king, the king dead from a death \nof the king that everyone both fears and hopes for, and that every subject \nprojects into the autopsy or the necropsy of sovereignty.

Finally, the semiotic sacramental body, this third body being the one that \nprimarily interests Marin since, through the portrait of the king (that\u2019s \nwhy he calls it semiotic: you know Marin\u2019s \ufb01 ne work on portraits and \nmedals), [through the portrait of the king] the sacramental body is sup-\nposed to ensure the exchange, \u201cwithout remainder,\u201d says Marin, between \nthe three bodies.\nFor my part, I would suggest that this sacred or sacramental body, sworn in \nand legitimated by God himself, by divine sovereignty itself, is indeed the \nplace of exchange, the pact or alliance between the politico- juridical sov-\nereignty of terrestrial all- powerfulness and the celestial sovereignty of the \nall- powerful God. In any case, having put forward the hypothesis of these \nthree bodies, Marin quotes in support of his conjecture the following texts \nby Bossuet and Pascal. As they are very beautiful and say what is essential \nas to the structures and laws that matter to us here, I shall read them: (Read \nand comment)\nIn 1662, in his sermon on the duties of kings, Bossuet exclaims: \u201cTo estab-\nlish this power that represents his power, God places on the forehead of \nsovereigns and on their face a mark of divinity. [. . .] God has made in the \nPrince a mortal image of his immortal authority. You are gods, says David, \nand you are all children of the Most High. But, O gods of \ufb02 esh and blood, \nO gods of earth and dust, you will die like men. No matter, you are gods \neven though you die, and your authority does not die; this spirit of royalty \npasses entire to your successors and imprints everywhere the same fear, the \nsame respect, the same veneration. Man dies, it is true: but the king, we say, \nnever dies: the image of God is immortal.\u201d\n \nA few years earlier, on a little scrap of paper, Pascal had analyzed the \nmechanisms of the representational apparatus, describing the effects pro-\nduced and discerning their reasons in the con\ufb01 gurations they sketch out on \nthe political, juridical and theological planes: \u201cThe custom of seeing kings \n394 \n"

Globalization of the autopsic model, as I call it, \ncharging the attribute \u201cautopsic\u201d with all the features we have emphasized \nuntil now: the objectifying inspection of a knowledge that precisely inspects, \nsees, looks at the aspect of a zo\u00afon the life and force of which have been neu-\ntralized either by death or by captivity, or quite simply by ob- jecti\ufb01 cation \nthat exhibits there before, to hand, before the gaze, and de- vitalizes by \nsimple objecti\ufb01 cation, a learned objecti\ufb01 cation in the academic service of \na learned society, certainly, but a society for which, between the autopsic \nseeing of theoretical knowledge and the autopsic seeing of the theatrical \nspectacle, between the theoretical and the theatrical, between inspection \nand spectacle, the passage and transfer are more than tempting, in truth or-\nganized and institutionalized, whence the two other senses of autopsia: that \nof the necropsic relation to the cadaver and that of participation in divine \npower. I am specifying this point before coming to what in this \u201ctheoretico-\n theatrical,\u201d let\u2019s say inspectacular structure, autopsic and objectifying, de-\nvitalizing, also ensures a certain analogical passage between the modern \nand postrevolutionary zoological garden and psychiatric institutions, insane \nasylums.

A certain Hagenbeck was famous in Germany for furnish-\ning circuses with animals from all around the world (for spectacle and curi-\nosity, for taming and performance: the animals, captured and transported, \nbecame curiosities for the curiosity of the curious who wanted and hence-\nforth were able to see and observe them with their own eyes, autoptically), \nbut for furnishing menageries too. His son, Carl Hagenbeck (1844\u20131913), \nwas a writer, the author of an autobiography entitled Von Tieren und Men-\nschen (1908), and he extended his father\u2019s business, globalized it further in \nthe tracks of colonization, sending expeditions all over the world. Better \nstill, this writer- merchant was also a founder of institutions and of a school. \nWith the help of a Swiss architect and sculptor, Urs Eggenschwyler, he had \nthe huge zoological park in Hamburg constructed, which became famous, \namong other reasons, for the system of limits it innovated \u2014 or with which \nit was surrounded, as one surrounds with care by surrounding with limits. \nIt\u2019s certainly the concept of care, concern, solicitude, cura, that we are talk-\ning about here, and the question of knowing whether it\u2019s possible to sur-\nround with care, as we say, without surrounding with reappropriating lim-\nits. Inventing limits, installing limits, that\u2019s the art we are speaking of here. \nAnd it is an art of both caring and locking up. Between the beast and the \nsovereign, it\u2019s merely a question of limits, and knowing whether a limit is \ndivisible or indivisible. For knowing how to install a limit is both an art and \na technique, perhaps tekhne\u00af itself. Tekhne\u00af is perhaps always an invention \nof limits. Since the point here is always to limit the freedom of movement \nof these living beings, the strategy of the Hamburg zoo consisted in trans-\nforming the visible form and structure, the phenomenon, the phenomenal-\nity of these limits in order to render them all but unnoticeable, thus giving \nthe captive animals the illusion of an autonomy of movement: these new \nlimits, then, are no longer unbreakable metal railings (railings that already \nlimited movement while letting both sides see: so railings were already not \nan absolute and indivisible limit) [these new limits, then, are no longer un-\nbreakable metal railings] but deep ditches that no longer appear as fences, \nditches that disappear as they hollow out, that are formed and appear only \nhollowly [en creux], in sum, and that become negativized, hollowed- out [en \ncreux] limits, in absentia, as it were, even more uncrossable than railings but \nas invisible as an interiorized and freely consented- to limit, as if these poor \ncaptive and dumb animals had given a consent they never in fact gave to \na violence more sure of itself than ever, to what I\u2019ll call repressive violence \nwith a liberal, idealist, and spiritualist grimace.\nThis does not prevent Ellenberger from saying that Hagenbeck was \u201cnot \n \n398\n"

The \ufb01 rst result was an \nimprovement in the biological condition of animals. Many species that had \nnever reproduced in captivity began to do so in modern zoos.\u201d29\nThis question of the reproduction of life will be decisive here, in par-\nticular so as to distinguish, in their very analogy, between zoological gar-\ndens and psychiatric asylums, at least in the dominant interpretation, in \nparticular that of Ellenberger. In the joint, synchronic, and, up to a point, \nparallel improvement of the two institutions, the zoological park and the \npsychiatric hospital, if one allows the beasts to reproduce, one prevents the \nhumans from doing so, at least within the walls of the psychiatric asylums. \nBut let\u2019s wait a little.\nThe culture of curiosity thus organizes the showing of curiosities for cu-\nrious crowds, but the same culture of curiosity also had ambitions to treat, \nto care for, if not to cure. Or even to liberate by locking up differently. The \ncura of this curious curiosity always hesitated between two forms or two \naims of what is always a treatment.\nTreat, treatment: I propose to privilege this vocabulary of treatment be-\ncause I \ufb01 nd it quite appropriate here, precisely because it is equivocal, ap-\npropriate because of its equivocality, and this because of a certain essential \nim- propriety, a certain constitutive ambiguity in an experience of treatment, \nor even trade [la traite] (and the white slave trade obeys an analogous logic), \nof treatment, tractation, or trade without contract, which consists, precisely, \nin a strange and equivocal economy, a strange and equivocal ecology that \nconsists in expropriating the other, appropriating the other by depriving \nthe other of what is supposed to be proper to him or her, the other\u2019s proper \nplace, proper habitat, oikos. And time, Celan would say. For in this tekhne\u00af \nof limits, it is as much a matter of time as of space.

The Persian paradeisos had a function that Ellen-\nberger calls \u201cmystical\u201d: the king was the incarnation of the supreme god or \nthe master of creation, and so he received the offering or homage of these \nanimals in a garden forbidden to the common mortal. It was less forbidden \nfor the animals to leave than for the men and subjects of the king to enter.\nWell, this paradeisos itself was not original. It dates from the great em-\npires of Babylon and Assyria that themselves followed epochs of tribal po-\nlitical organizations whose potentates already gathered for themselves col-\nlections of wild animals with no obvious purpose, apparently for pure play, \nand sometimes ending by massacring them.

We shall see in a moment that he did not fail \nto do so, too.\nBut as Aristotle\u2019s text comes before the Gospels and above all remains \nthe more political, in truth the only one that is explicitly and literally politi-\ncal, in the \ufb01 rst, i.e. Greek, sense of that word, the only one that conjugates \nlogos with the political, I should like (since with sovereignty we are above all \ntalking about the political), [I should like], at risk of belaboring paths that \nhave already been cleared many times, to return a little to the letter of this \n \n418\n \n419\n"

All of Agamben\u2019s \ndemonstrative strategy, here and elsewhere, puts its money on a distinction \nor a radical, clear, univocal exclusion, among the Greeks and in Aristo-\ntle in particular, between bare life (zo\u00afe\u00af), common to all living beings (ani-\nmals, men, and gods), and life quali\ufb01 ed as individual or group life (bios: bios \ntheo\u00afre\u00aftikos, for example, contemplative life, bios apolaustikos, life of plea-\nsure, bios politikos, political life). What is unfortunate is that this distinction \nis never so clear and secure, and that Agamben himself has to admit that \nthere are exceptions, for example in the case of God, who, says Aristotle\u2019s \nMetaphysics,13 has a zo\u00afe\u00af ariste\u00af kai aidios, a noble and eternal life. Such an in-\nsecure semantic distinction cannot serve to determine a historical periodiza-\ntion, which causes Agamben to say, I quote again:\nWhat characterizes modern politics is not so much the inclusion of zo\u00afe\u00af \nin the polis \u2014 which is, in itself, absolutely ancient \u2014 nor simply the fact \nthat life as such becomes a principal object of the projections and calcu-\nlations of State power. Instead the decisive fact is that, together with the \nprocess by which the exception everywhere becomes the rule, the realm of \nbare life \u2014 which is originally situated at the margins of the political or-\nder \u2014 gradually begins to coincide with the political realm, and exclusion \nand inclusion, outside and inside, bios and zo\u00e9, right and fact, enter into a \nzone of irreducible indistinction.14\nWhat is dif\ufb01 cult to sustain, in this thesis, is the idea of an entry (a modern \nentry, then) into a zone of irreducible indifferentiation, when the differ-\nentiation has never been secure (I would say Agamben furtively admits as \nmuch); and, above all, what remains even more dif\ufb01 cult to sustain is the \nidea that there is in this something modern or new; for Agamben himself, as \nyou are about to hear, taking the Foucauldian idea of a speci\ufb01 cally modern \nbiopolitics seriously, [Agamben] is keen to recall that it is as ancient as can \n12.

We are indeed dealing with a con-\n\ufb02 ict between more than one force. For the legein or the logos as gathering, \nas Sammlung or Versammlung, which Heidegger holds to be more originary \nthan logos as reason or logic, is already a deployment of force and violence. \nGathering is never, says Heidegger, a simple putting together, a simple ac-\ncumulation, it is what retains in a mutual belonging (Zusammengeh\u00f6rigkeit) \nwithout allowing itself to disperse. And in this retention, logos already has \nthe violent character of a predominance or, as it is translated [into French], \na perdominance, a Durchwalten of physis.18 Physis is that Gewalt, that de-\nployment of force, which does not dissolve into the void of an absence of \ncontrasts or contraries (in eine leere Gegensatzlosigkeit), but maintains what \nis thus \u201cdurchwaltet,\u201d traversed, shot through by the deployment of sov-\nereignty, or of forces, in the highest acuity of its tension (its tension itself \nextreme, one might say sovereign, \u201cin der h\u00f6chsten Sch\u00e4rfe seiner Spannung\u201d). \nSo the logos is itself, however one interprets it, as gathering, Sammlung, or, \nlater, as logic, reason or understanding \u2014 the logos is already, always, of the \norder of power, force, or even violence, of the order of that Gewalt that is so \n17.

Prudently, \nHeidegger notes that one ought to distinguish here between the Synop-\ntics and the Gospel of John, but he considers that, essentially, at bottom \n(grund s\u00e4tzlich), the New Testament logos does not mean, as in Heraclitus \nfor example, the Being of the entity (das Sein des Seienden), the gathering of \nantagonistic forces (die Gesammeltheit des Gegenstrebigen). The logos of John \ndoes not signify the Being of the entity or what holds contraries together, \nbut designates one particular entity (\u201cein besonderes Seiendes\u201d: Heidegger \nemphasizes \u201cone\u201d), namely the son of God, in his mediating function be-\ntween God and man.\nThis accident of the logos, this drift that distances the logos from its Greek \noriginarity is, moreover, a Jewish heritage since, quite rarely for Heidegger, \nhe judges it necessary, in one sentence, to identify, uncover, or even to de-\nnounce, in this representation of the logos as mediator, the \ufb01 liation or in\ufb02 u-\nence of what he calls a representation, \u201cthat of the Jewish philosophy of \nreligion\u201d (\u201cdiejenige der j\u00fcdischen Religionsphilosophie\u201d) [he doesn\u2019t say the \nJewish religion but the Jewish philosophy of religion], here that of Philo \nthe Jew. Philo, in his philosophy of the creation, Heidegger reminds us, had \nindeed attributed to the logos the function of mesite\u00afs, mediator. This read-\ning of the evangelical logos under the in\ufb02 uence of Greco- Jewish philosophy, \nunder the in\ufb02 uence of Hellenistic Judaism, basically, is of interest to us for \ntwo reasons as we try to put some order into our trousseau of canonical texts. \nOn the one hand, because in this Christian appropriation of the logos, what is \nat stake is the performative commandment; on the other hand, because what \nis at stake is life (life as zo\u00afe\u00af).\nHow so?\nA. Well, on the one hand, \ufb01 rst, then, in the translation of the Septuagint, in \nthe translation of what is called the Old Testament, logos is the name given \nto the word of God as commandment (Befehl, Gebot). The \u201cten command-\nments\u201d is translated as \u201coi deka logoi.\u201d This is, as it is called, the Decalogue. \n \n426\n"

Logos tou staurou, the logos of the cross, is the \nword come from the cross. The Gospel of the Cross is Christ himself.\nB. And, on the other hand, second, then, Christ is the logos of redemption \n(der Logos der Erl\u00f6sung), the logos of eternal life, the logos of zo\u00afe\u00af (logos des \newigen Leben, logos zo\u00afe\u00afs). Christ in this sense \u2014 Heidegger doesn\u2019t say so, \nbut I believe I\u2019m authorized to, following his interpretation \u2014 not only is \na Jew, and not only a Jew, as is well known, by his origins, but is a Jew de-\ntermined as logos mesites on the basis of a Jewish appropriation (Philo) of \nthe Greek logos, a zoological Jew, since he is a Jew who unites in his person, \nas son of God, both logos and zo\u00afe\u00af. And he is zoological not only because of \nthe sacri\ufb01 cial lamb, because of the Paschal lamb of the Jews or the mystical \nlamb that erases the sins of the world.

As for him, Christ, qua man, not only has the \nlogos; he is the logos. Incarnate. He incarnates the logos that he has.\nThese statements of Heidegger\u2019s, like the Introduction to Metaphysics, \ndate from 1935, from courses given in Freiburg. About ten years later, af-\nter the war, in 1946, in the Letter on Humanism, we \ufb01 nd the same view on \nthe subject of the animal rationale or the zo\u00afon logon ekhon, but this time \nthe critique of the biologism \u2014 denounced by name (Biologismus) \u2014 that \nHeidegger associates with it, doubtless has a political signi\ufb01 cation (and this \nis not the \ufb01 rst time that Heidegger attacks biologism, which is an at least \nindirect and virtual critique of something in Nazism); but this indicates, \nmost importantly, that Heidegger, whom one can hardly suspect of lack of \ninterest for the resources and rules of the Greek language, does not place \nbetween bios and zo\u00afe\u00af the airtight frontier along which Agamben constructs \nhis whole discourse.

Heidegger wants \ufb01 rst of all to show that the determina-\ntion of man as a rational animal is insuf\ufb01 ciently humanist, as it were, that it \nmisses the humanity of man, what is proper to man. And what thus misses \nthe essence of man is metaphysics.\n2. Second stage. Heidegger denounces the biologism, the biologistic re-\nduction of this de\ufb01 nition of man. And that means that the metaphysics of \nclassical humanism, the metaphysics that is not humanistic enough, is, deep \ndown, the ally or accomplice of biologism and zoologism.\nMetaphysics does not ask about the truth of Being itself. Nor does it there-\nfore ask in what way the essence of man belongs to the truth of Being. \nMetaphysics has not only failed up to now to ask this question, the question \nis inaccessible to metaphysics as metaphysics [Diese Frage ist der Metaphysik \nals Metaphysic unzug\u00e4nglich]. Being is still waiting for the time when it will \nbecome thought- provoking [denkw\u00fcrdig: worthy of thought] to man. With \nregard to the de\ufb01 nition of man\u2019s essence, however one may determine the \nratio or the animal and the reason of the living being, whether as a \u201cfaculty \nof principles\u201d [Verm\u00f6gen der Prinzipien] or a \u201cfaculty of categories\u201d [Verm\u00f6-\ngen der Kategorien], or in some other way, the essence of reason is always \nand in each case grounded in this: for every apprehending of beings in their \nBeing, Being itself is already illumined and comes to pass in its truth. So \ntoo with animal, zo\u00afon, an interpretation of \u201clife\u201d is already posited which \nnecessarily lies in an interpretation of beings as zo\u00afe\u00af and physis, within which \nwhat is living appears. Above and beyond everything else, however, it \ufb01 -\nnally remains to ask whether the essence of man [das Wesen des Menschen] \nprimordially and most decisively lies in the dimension of animalitas at all \n[in der Dimension der animalitas]. Are we really on the right track toward \nthe essence of man as long as we set him off as one living creature among \nothers in contrast to plants, beasts, and God? We can proceed in that way; \nwe can in such fashion locate man within being as one being among others. \nWe will thereby always be able to state something correct about man. But \nwe must be clear on this point, that when we do this we abandon man to the \nessential realm of animalitas [in den Wesensbereich der animalitas] even if we \ndo not equate him with beasts but attribute a speci\ufb01 c difference to him. In \nprinciple we are still thinking of homo animalis \u2014 even when anima [soul] is \nposited as animus sive mens [spirit or mind], and this in turn is later posited \nas subject, person or spirit [Geist]. Such positing is the manner of metaphys-\nics. But then the essence of man is too little heeded and not thought in its \norigin, the essential provenance that is always the essential future for his-\nYork: Harper and Row, 1977), pp. 193\u201342.

Metaphysics thinks of man on the basis of animalitas and \ndoes not think in the direction of his humanitas.20\nAnd here is the passage that concerns the critique of biologism (one can say, \nwithout violation, the critique of biopoliticism):\nEk- sistence [Ek- sistenz] can be said only of the essence of man, that is, only \nof the human way \u201cto be.\u201d For as far as our experience shows, only man is \nadmitted to the destiny of ek- sistence. Therefore ek- sistence can also never \nbe thought of as a speci\ufb01 c kind of living creature among others \u2014 granted \nthat man is destined to think the essence of his Being and not merely to give \naccounts of the nature and history of his constitution and activities. Thus \neven what we attribute to man as animalitas on the basis of the comparison \nwith \u201cbeast\u201d is itself grounded in the essence of ek- sistence. The human \nbody is something essentially other than an animal organism [Der Leib des \nMenschen ist etwas wesentlich anderes als ein tierischer Organismus]. Nor is \nthe error of biologism [Die Verirrung des Biologismus] overcome by adjoin-\ning a soul to the human body, a mind to the soul, and the existential to the \nmind, and then louder than before singing the praises of the mind \u2014 only \nto let everything relapse into \u201clife- experience,\u201d with a warning that think-\ning by its in\ufb02 exible concepts disrupts the \ufb02 ow of life and that thought of \nBeing distorts existence [there are many enemies lurking here . . . ]. The \nfact that physiology and physiological chemistry can scienti\ufb01 cally investi-\ngate man as an organism is no proof that in this \u201corganic\u201d thing, that is, in \nthe body scienti\ufb01 cally explained, the essence of man consists. That has as \nlittle validity as the notion that the essence of nature has been discovered \nin atomic energy. It could even be that nature, in the face she turns toward \nman\u2019s technical mastery, is simply concealing her essence. Just as little as the \nessence of man consists in being an animal organism can this insuf\ufb01 cient \nde\ufb01 nition of man\u2019s essence be overcome or offset by out\ufb01 tting man with \na immortal soul, the power of reason, or the character of a person. In each \ninstance essence is passed over, and passed over on the basis of the same \nmetaphysical projection.21\nHere, of course, we\u2019re not getting into Heidegger\u2019s discourse on the animal, \non the beast that is weltarm: that would require much more time, and I \nhope to do it next year. Heidegger\u2019s propositions that I was concerned to \nrecall today so as to reconstitute a context, with a view to approaching the \nopening of Aristotle\u2019s politics on man the political animal, are propositions \nthat are quoted neither by Foucault (who practically never talks about Hei-\ndegger, not even when he introduces his problematic of biopower), nor by \n20.

Instead \nthe decisive fact is that, together with the process by which the exception \neverywhere becomes the rule, the realm of bare life \u2014 which is originally \nsituated at the margins of the political order \u2014 gradually begins to coincide \nwith the political realm, and exclusion and inclusion, outside and inside, \nbios and zo\u00afe\u00af, right and fact, enter into a zone of irreducible indistinction.25\nThe whole dif\ufb01 culty depends on the fact that Agamben wants absolutely \nto de\ufb01 ne the speci\ufb01 city of modern politics or biopolitics (which Foucault \nmakes his theme at the end of The Will to Knowledge and at least the pos-\nsibility of which Heidegger, let\u2019s say, didn\u2019t fail to think), Agamben wants \nabsolutely to de\ufb01 ne this speci\ufb01 city by putting his money on the concept of \n\u201cbare life,\u201d which he identi\ufb01 es with zo\u00afe\u00af, in opposition to bios.

Agamben continues:\nIn any case, however, the entry of zo\u00afe\u00af into the sphere of the polis \u2014 the po-\nliticization of bare life as such \u2014 constitutes the decisive event of modernity \nand signals a radical transformation of the political- philosophical catego-\nries of classical thought.

It can even be said that the production of a biopolitical body \nis the original activity of sovereign power. In this sense, biopolitics is at least as \nold as the sovereign exception. Placing biological life at the center of its cal-\nculations, the modern State therefore does nothing other than bring to light \nthe secret tie uniting power and bare life, thereby reaf\ufb01 rming the bond \n(derived from a tenacious correspondence between the modern and the ar-\nchaic which one encounters in the most diverse spheres) between modern \npower and the most immemorial of the arcana imperii.33\nWhy so much emphasis on the detail of these texts, in this case those of \nAgamben and Foucault, Agamben with or, more precisely, right up against \nFoucault, close up to him but paying him the homage of a multiple and \npressing objection, Foucault whose theses should be, says Agamben whom \nI quote again, \u201creconsidered, corrected and completed\u201d?\nIf I emphasize them so much, it\u2019s because these discourses are highly \ninteresting, \ufb01 rst of all; they go to the heart of what matters to us in this \nseminar: sovereign power, life and death, animality, etc. In Foucault, you \nshould reread closely, among other things (as I did not so long ago, here and \nelsewhere,34 I don\u2019t want to go back to it now) concerning sovereign power \nas power of life and death, in [the \ufb01 rst volume of ] The History of Sexuality, \nthe last chapter, entitled \u201cRight of Death and Power over Life.\u201d35 That\u2019s \nwhere you \ufb01 nd the discourse on \u201cthe austere monarchy of sex\u201d36 that I tried \nto interrogate and interpret in Resistances (\u201cTo Do Justice to Freud\u201d)37 and \n33.

So I\u2019ve chosen, in attempting this quasi- concluding \nre\ufb02 ection as a kind of premise for the discussion that will follow, to mark, \nremark, and have you remark with me the fact that at bottom everything \nwe have spoken about came down to problems of translation. Translation \nin a sense at once fundamental and diverse. Translation, \ufb01 rst of all, because \nbetween animal and man \u2014 what is often called by these names, follow-\ning distinctions received in an all- powerful and still living, surviving, tradi-\ntion \u2014 people speak of differences in manifestation, in signi\ufb01 cation, in sig-\nni\ufb01 cance (I\u2019ve often emphasized this, because it holds true from Descartes \nto Lacan, inclusive), and they oppose a logic of programmed reaction in the \nanimal to a logic of free and sovereign responsibility in man. And between \nwhat is interpreted as reaction and what is interpreted as response, respon-\nsibility, or responsible response, what is at stake is, precisely, a translating \ninterpretation \u2014 and every interpretation is a translation. It\u2019s in our way \nof translating what are called animal reactions that we believe ourselves \nable \u2014 but this is a risk of translation \u2014 to discern or trace a limit between \nanimality and humanity, reactive animality and responsive or responsible \nhumanity. It\u2019s a question of translation between languages.\nThere\u2019s another dimension to this problematic of translation, and it con-\ncerns basically all the words we have used, many words, and in particular \nthe fundamental, guiding words, starting with \u201canimal\u201d or \u201cbeast.\u201d I en-\ntitled this seminar The Beast and the Sovereign because, in French, b\u00eate is not \nthe same thing as \u201canimal,\u201d and you will remember the fearsome problems \nof idiom we had to deal with when we had to distinguish b\u00eate from bestialit\u00e9 \nand above all from b\u00ea tise, given that these are not necessarily characteristics \nof the animal. And you remember too that the word b\u00ea tise, the French word \nb\u00ea tise, came up against impassable limits as to its translation, the word- for-\n word translation, the translation of the word, the vocable: there is no word \nin the world that translates the French word b\u00ea tise. This, I think, we have \nshown. This means, among other things, that the way that we French or \nFrancophones live, experience, practice, and put to work the word b\u00eate or \nthe word b\u00ea tise is each time conditioned by contextual systems such that, \neven in French, the word b\u00ea tise is not translatable from French into French: \nI use the word b\u00ea tise in one sense in one context, and in another sense, with \nanother connotation, with another performative effect, in another con-\ntext \u2014 in other words, the word b\u00ea tise is untranslatable from French into \n \n447\n"

And the fact that the context (what we name with this \nsomewhat facile word \u201ccontext,\u201d i.e. the pragmatic situation) determines in \nsuch a constraining fashion each time the meaning of the word b\u00eate or b\u00ea-\ntise \u2014 this fact means that between the language spoken by those men and \nwomen called French, and animal language, i.e. something commanded by \ncomplicated programs or wiring, there is no easily formalizable difference. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we speak like beasts every time we use the word \nb\u00ea tise, but that the privilege of the idiom \u2014 which can be the privilege of \npoetry, which can be the privilege, of course, as is always the case with the \nidiom, the privilege of the unique event of language that is, for example, \ntermed \u201cpoetic\u201d \u2014 this doesn\u2019t merely mean the poem, it also means a cer-\ntain contamination by what we attribute to so- called reactive or reactional \nanimality.\nSo you see that this question of translation is very broadly overdeter-\nmining for all the problems we are discussing here. These are of course, \nas I just pointed out, problems of translation in discursive language, dis-\ncursive praxis, what we call \u201chuman language,\u201d but already the circum-\nscription of what is called \u201chuman language\u201d becomes problematical for \nthe reasons I have just given. But this is where we are going to encounter \nanother problem of translatio, of translation [de translation, de traduction], \nfolding back on itself or folding and refolding this \ufb01 rst translation: this is \nthat, when we tried to name animality in non- French languages, we en-\ncountered words like bios and zo\u00afe\u00af, two ways of naming life with all the \nproblems you remember, which we tried to deal with last week in reference \nto \u2014 using as our pretext \u2014 Agamben\u2019s text: does the animal come under \nbios or zo\u00afe\u00af? etc. And we naturally bounced back, as to language and as to \nthis distinction between bios and zo\u00afe\u00af, as to the animal or human living be-\ning, onto the fundamental word logos \u2014 man de\ufb01 ned as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, \nthe animal, the living being possessed of logos. What does that mean? It \nhas governed an enormous tradition. The whole tradition we are speak-\ning about has been governed by this de\ufb01 nition, the dif\ufb01 culties of which we \nwere seeing last week, depending on whether one accepts or not Agamben\u2019s \nproposed distinction between \u201cessential attribute\u201d and \u201cspeci\ufb01 c difference,\u201d \na distinction that I found to be fragile. In any case, logos itself, whether \none translates it as language, as is often done, as discourse, or as reason or \nelse as calculation, counting (that the word ratio will translate: reason as \ncounting, as calculus), the word logos itself raised considerable issues when \n448 \n"

We got just a small idea of them, an idea at least, \nby following Heidegger\u2019s interpretation (itself a translating interpretation) \nwhen, even as he himself is protesting, proposing the deconstruction of the \nclassical de\ufb01 nition of man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, as animal rationale, he in-\nvites us to consider the fact that the Greek logos, the legein, which is all at \nonce saying, gathering, assembling, reading too (legere comes from it), had \nbeen diverted from its meaning, which (as Heidegger sees it) is what gath-\ners, maintaining opposites, contraries, by force, and all this in an element \nwhere we are dealing with the physis that can\u2019t even be translated as nature. \nAnother problem of translation: physis is not, for Heidegger, natura; phy-\nsis is everything that grows, phyein, what increases and in what increases, \nin the world or in being as physis, the logos plays, represents, precisely, a \n\u201cforce,\u201d and Heidegger insists on the force (recall words I emphasized last \ntime, such as Herrschaft or Machstellung, which appeal precisely to a deploy-\nment of force), a force of maintaining contraries together \u2014 well, that force, \nthe sense of that originary force of the Greek legein (in Heraclitus, for ex-\nample), has supposedly been diverted or occulted or perverted \u2014 so many \npossible interpretations \u2014 supposedly forgotten, in any case, for example, \nwhen John, John the Evangelist, says that \u201cin the beginning was the lo-\ngos,\u201d identi\ufb01 ed not with the Being of beings, but with a particular entity, i.e. \nChrist, the mediator; when John, in\ufb02 uenced by Philo the Jew, interpreting \nprecisely logos as mediation, as mediator, translates, identi\ufb01 es the logos with \nChrist, and there too Heidegger talks of a Herrschaft, a Machstellung, i.e. an \noperation of sovereignty, of a force that comes to win out over another force. \nSo we are dealing here, as to translative interpretation, with a translation \nthat is not merely a peaceful dictionary- based or interlinguistic operation: \nit is an interpretive translation that brings with it the whole of culture, and \nwhich is not separable from historial movements in which all the forces of \nthe world and the age are engaged. It is not a matter of philologists who de-\ncided all on their own to translate, to interpret logos as Christ, as mediator: it \nis the whole force of history that is at work to produce this translation. And \nobviously, just as this translation occults, or forgets, or deforms, or corrupts, \nor perverts, according to Heidegger, the originary sense of logos, so, in the \ntext by Aristotle that carries such authority, Aristotle\u2019s Politics (I\u2019ll come to \nit in a moment), that de\ufb01 nes man as a zo\u00afon, as a living animal possessed of \nlogos, there too the logos is no longer the originary logos, and this is what \nwill give rise to the entire tradition of rational man, man as rational animal, \ncalculating animal, etc. So you see that what is at stake in translation cannot \nbe limited to the great question that we are dealing with here, \u201cthe beast \n \n449\n \n450\n"

But this plaint is also the sur-\nface on which the people begins to pullulate, of the legend that carves it \nup and feudalizes it to make a place for the Capetian king. The wolf, the \nking, the saint will then be incorporated [incorporation of the beast and \nthe sovereign] into a set- up in which each term will express a function \nthat the other feudalizes according to a new function. Feudality is here \nthe index of a multiple- subjection function, an assemblage that the name \n\u201cMarcwulf\u201d delimits and individualizes much better that the ceremony of \nthe consecration, unable to account for the process of subjectivation capable \nof inscribing the saint and the king, the king and the wolf into one and the \nsame heterotopic ethos.\n \nMarcwulf, the \u201cwolf of the marches\u201d [\u201cmarch\u201d in the sense of limit, or \nlimen, frontier], the processual wolf, designates this popular chimera that \nthe people constantly celebrates as the machination of its own consistency, \nan animal sent from the people like the leitmotiv of a social crystallography, \na motif capable of con\ufb01 guring the forces that traverse it and that relaunch \nthemselves as a multiform, thaumaturgical king [remember the thauma-\nturgical kings we mentioned when we were reading Marin, and in connec-\ntion with Kantorowicz\u2019s King\u2019s Two Bodies, preceded by Marc Bloch\u2019s book \nLes rois thaumaturges]. A king who, moreover, depends more on the saint \nand the wolf, to whom he will be like a vassal, than on the foundational \nconsecration conceived of as a sticking point, a blockage of dubbings. There \nis of course no doubt that the consecration, the ceremony of investiture, suc-\nceeded in the end in taking hold of the feudal machine to make it into that \nstate apparatus magni\ufb01 ed by Adalb\u00e9ron, a royalty allied to the pope and to \nthe reformed Church [this is of course a huge story . . . I\u2019m reading fast and \nyou\u2019d need to read the whole book]. But the fact that the confrontation of \nthe feudal machine be abolished in the mesh of power knotted vertically \naround a centralized state does not prevent that fact that there was a con-\nfrontation, a suspension of political singularities, in the passage from the \nCarolingians to the Capetian dynasty.7\nI\u2019ll \ufb01 nish my quotation here. You can see clearly that it\u2019s also about a con\ufb02 ict \nfor sovereignty between two dynasties, with the stake being the af\ufb01 rmation \nof a state sovereignty on the basis of feudal structures, a war between lords \nand king. I especially wanted to read you this text, not only because of the \nwolves and the Capetians and the Carolingians, but also because what\u2019s go-\ning on here is a translating operation, rhetorical, metonymical, a force that \ndisplaces names, and there too, in a sense, it\u2019s about logos.

This logocentrism of \nthe Abrahamic religions and of philosophy signifying not so much that the \nlogos was simply the center of everything, but that it was in a situation, \nprecisely, of sovereign hegemony, organizing everything on the basis of its \nforced translations.\nSo, on that basis, I suggest two things for the twenty minutes or so we \nhave left: \ufb01 rst to have a quick look at logos in Aristotle\u2019s Politics, in the fa-\nmous passage in which Aristotle de\ufb01 nes man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, and then, \nif we have time, a word about the Bible, with which I meant to start at the \nvery beginning.\nAs I was saying very quickly last time, it\u2019s the very beginning of book 1 \nof the Politics, that\u2019s where it starts, and Aristotle is de\ufb01 ning the polis, the \nstate as a sort of community (koino\u00afnia), which, as a community, is consti-\ntuted with a view to a certain good. The state is a community organized \nwith a view to a good, agathon. One might say that this agathon is naturally \nsought, as a good, by every community, even an animal community, but \nwhat  Aristotle announces from the start is that the state as human commu-\nnity, as human koino\u00afnia, is organized with a view to the good as sovereign \ngood;8 this is the standard translation, and of course the word translated as \nsovereign is, as you\u2019ll remember from when we were talking about Bodin, \nthe word that is most often used in Greek to designate sovereignty, kurios:\n. . . it is obvious that all aim at a certain good and that precisely the sover-\neign good [kurio\u00aftatou, the sovereign good, the supreme good] among all \ngoods is the end of the community that is sovereign [kurio\u00aftate\u00af] among all \n[the community is basically sovereign over all, and so the notion of sov-\nereignty is de\ufb01 ned here, from the start, inscribed into the very concept of \nstate, polis, and community] and includes all the others: the one called the \nCity or the political community [e koino\u00afnia e politike\u00af].

And thus \n(we\u2019ll return to this) his critique, if you like, of zo\u00afon logon ekhon, the animal \nrationale, concerns not only the de\ufb01 nition of man in his relation to logos, but \nalso the de\ufb01 nition of the political: man as political animal is indissociable \nfrom the de\ufb01 nition of man as having the logos, logon ekhon.\nSo here is Aristotle\u2019s text:\nFrom these considerations it is clear that the City is a natural reality and \nthat man is naturally a being destined to live in a City [political animal, to\u00afn \nphusei e polis esti, kai oti antho\u00afpos phusei politikon zo\u00afon: is a political animal]; \nhe who is cityless is, by nature and not by chance, a being either degraded \nor else superior to man [the one who is without a City, who is apolis, who \nis apolitical, is either below or else above man, either an animal or else god: \nthe political is properly human, what in life is properly human: \u201che who \nis cityless (kai o apolis dia phusin kai ou dia tukhe\u00afn, etc.), is, by nature and \nnot by chance, either below or else above man\u201d]: he is like the man Homer \nreproaches with having \u201cno clan, no law, no hearth\u201d; a man this way by \nnature is by the same token warlike; he is like an isolated pawn in chess. \nAnd so the reason is clear why man is a political being more than any others, \nbees or gregarious animals. As we maintain, indeed, nature does nothing in \nvain; now alone among animals man has speech [logon de\u00af monon anthro\u00afpos \nekhei to\u00afn zo\u00afon: so, there is an essential link between politicity and the dispo-\nsition to the logos, they are indissociable.] No doubt the sounds of the voice \n[phone\u00af] express pain and pleasure, and so they are found in all animals: their \nnature allows them only to feel pain and pleasure and to manifest them \namong themselves [so phone\u00af does not suf\ufb01 ce to de\ufb01 ne logos].14\n(When I distinguished \u2014 a very long time ago \u2014 between logocentrism and \nphonocentrism,15 it was precisely to mark the fact that logocentrism, by ref-\nerence to this signi\ufb01 er, this vocable, logos, which is proper to the historico-\n cultural zone I was de\ufb01 ning a moment ago (Abrahamic, evangelical reli-\n14.

You know \nthat in Chinese culture, for example, writing is not of the phonetic type \nalthough there are phonetic elements in it; nevertheless, there are many \nsigns of a recognized authority of the vocal, which means, in my opinion, \nthat phonocentrism is universal, which logocentrism is not. In any case, the \nphone\u00af named here by Aristotle only concerns the emission of sounds, and \nthis can, indeed, appear in animals without reason, without logos: there is \nphone\u00af without logos.)\nNo doubt the sounds of the voice [phone\u00af] express pain and pleasure, and so \nthey are found in all animals: their nature allows them only to feel pain and \npleasure and to manifest them among themselves. But speech [logos], for its \npart, is made to express the useful and the harmful and consequently the \njust and the unjust [in other words, there is an essential link between speech \n(logos) and the good (agathon), the just and the unjust (dikaion / adikon). Ani-\nmals are incapable of this: they do indeed have phone\u00af, but they have neither \nlogos nor a relation to the good, to the sovereign good, to the just or the un-\njust].

But precisely, what Aristotle says \u2014 and this is where this distinction \nbetween the two attributions does not work \u2014 is that man is that living be-\ning who is taken by politics: he is a political living being, and essentially so. \nIn other words, he is zoo- political, that\u2019s his essential de\ufb01 nition, that\u2019s what \n16.
