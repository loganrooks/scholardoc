It always has the role of mediation and communication: it transmits sonic\nvibrations to the chain of small bones, and then to the inner ear. Bichat recognized\nthat it has another paradoxical function. This small hone protects the tympanum\nwhile acting upon it. \"Without it, the tvmpanum would be affected painfully by\nvibrations set up by too powerful sounds.\" The hammer, thus, can weaken the\nblows, muffle them on the threshold of the inner ear.

Such, at least, is the most insistent\nhypothesis of this book. A quasi-organizing role\nis granted, therefore, to the motif of sonic vibration\n(the Hegelian Erzittern) as to the motif of the prox-\nimity of the meaning of Being in speech (Heideg-\ngerian Nahe and Ereignis). The logic of the event\nis examined from the vantage of the structures of\nexpropriation called timbre (tympanum), style, and\nsignature. Timbre, style, and signature are the same\nobliterating division of the proper. They make\nevery event possible, necessary, and unfindable.\nWhat is the specific resistance of philosophical\ndiscourse to deconstruction? It is the infinite mas-\ntery that the agency of Being (and of the) proper\nseems to assure it; this mastery permits it to in-\nteriorize every limit as being and as being its own\nproper. To exceed it, by the same token, and there-\nfore to preserve it in itself. Now, in its mastery and\nits discourse on mastery (for mastery is a signifi-\ncation that we still owe to it),\nalways seems to combine two types.\nparticular sci-\nences and regional\nare subordinated to\ngeneral ontology, and then to fundamental ontol-\nogy.\nthis point of view all the questions that\nsolicit Being and the proper upset the order that\nsubmits the determined fields of science, its formal\nnames, a durable su-\nture is thus formed\nbetween the throat\nand the tympanum,\nwhich, the one as\nmuch as the other,\nare subject to a fear\nof being injured, be-\nsides both belonging\nto the same cavern-\nous domain.

Diff\u00e9rer in this sense is to temporize, to take recourse,\nconsciously or unconsciously, in the temporal and temporizing mediation of a\ndetour that suspends the accomplishment or fulfillment of \"desire\" or \"will,\"\nand equally effects this suspension in a mode that annuls or tempers its own\neffect. And we will see, later, how this temporization is also temporalization and\nspacing, the becoming-time of space and the becoming-space of time, the \"or-\niginary constitution\" of time and space, as metaphysics or transcendental phe-\nnomenology would say, to use the language that here is criticized and displaced.\nThe other sense of differer is the more common and identifiable one: to be not\nidentical, to be other, discernible, etc. When dealing with differen(ts)(ds), a word\nthat can be written with a final ts or a final ds, as you will, whether it is a question\nof dissimilar otherness or of allergic and polemical othemess, \u00e0\u00f1ititerval, a\ndistance, spacing, must be produced between the elements other, and be pro-\nduced with a certain perseverence in repetition.8\nthe word difference (with an e) can never refer either to differer as tem-\nporization or to diff\u00e9rends as polemos.9 Thus the word difference (with an a) is to\ncompensate\u2014economically\u2014this loss of meaning, for differance can refer simul-\ntaneously to the entire\nof its meanings. It is immediately and\nirreducibly polysemic, which will not be indifferent to the economy of my dis-\ncourse here. In its polysemia this word, of course, like any meaning, must defer\nto the discourse in which it occurs, its interpretive context; but in a way it defers\nitself, or at least does so more readily than any other word, the a immediately\nderiving from the present participle (differant), thereby bringing us close to the\nvery action of the verb differer, before it has even produced an effect constituted\nsomething different or as difference (with an e).'\u00b0 In a conceptuality adhering\n8. TN. The next few sentences will require some annotation, to be found in this note\nand the next two.

Les diff\u00e9rents are different things; les\ndiff\u00e9rends are differences of opinion, grounds for dispute\u2014whence the references to allergy\n(from the Greek allos, other) and polemics.\n9. TN. However, to continue the last note, difference (in French) does not convey the\nsense of active putting off, of deferring (diff\u00e9rance in what would be its usual sense in\nFrench, if it were a word in common usage), or the sense of active polemical difference,\nactively differing with someone or something. (\"Active\" here, though, is not really correct,\nFor reasons that Derrida will explain below.) The point is that there is no noun-verb, no\ngerund for either sense in French.\n10. TN. Such a gerund would normally be constructed from the present participle of\nthe verb: diffCrant. Curiously then, the noun differance suspends itself between the two\nsenses of diff\u00e9rant\u2014deferring, differing. We might say that it defers differing, and differs\nfrom deferring, in and of itself.\n8\n"

I contend, of course, that the word differance can\nalso serve other purposes: first, because it marks not only the activity of \"on-\nginary\" difference, but also the temporizing detour of deferral; and above all\nbecause diff\u00e9rance thus written, although maintaining relations of profound af-\nfinity with Hegelian discourse (such as it must be read), is also, up to a certain\npoint, unable to break with that discourse (which has no kind of meaning or\nchance); but it can operate a kind of infinitesimal and radical displacement of\nit, whose space I attempt to delineate elsewhere but of which it would be difficult\nto speak briefly here.\n\u00b6\nDifferences, thus, are \"produced\"\u2014deferred\u2014by differance. But what defers\nor who defers? In other words, what is differance? With this question we reach\nanother level and another resource of our problematic.\nr\nWhat differs? Who differs? What is differance?\nIf we answered these questions before examining them as questions, befor\nturning them back on themselves, and before suspecting their very form, in-\ncluding what seems most natural and necessary about them, we would im-\nmediately fall back into what we have just disengaged ourselves from.

In his translation of \"La differance\" (in Speech\nand Phenomena (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 19731), David Allison notes (p.\n144) that the citation from Hegel comes from \"Jensener Logik, Metaphysik, und Natur-\nphiosophie\" in S\u00e4,ntliche Werke (Leipzig: F.

The point here, which cannot be conveyed in English, is that Koyre's realizat' rn\nthat 1-legel is describing a \"differentiating relation,\" or \"different\" in an active sense, is\nprecisely what the formation of diffErance from the participle differant describes, as explained\nin notes 9 and 10 above. And that it is the present that is described as differing from and\ndefernng itself helps clarify Derrida's argument (at the end of the essay) that presence is\nto be rethought as the trace of the trace, as differauce differed-and-deferred.\n14\n"

The putting into question of the authority of consciousness\nis first and always differential.\nr\nThe two apparently different values of differance are tied together in Freudian\ntheory: to differ as discernibility, distinction, separation, diastem, spacing; and\nto defer as detour, relay, reserve, temporization.\n1. The concepts of trace (Spur), of breaching (Bahnung),2' and of the forces of\nbreaching, from the Project on, are inseparable from the concept of difference.\nThe origin of memory, and of the psyche as (conscious or unconscious) memory\nin general, can be described only by taking into account the difference between\nbreaches.

According to a schema that never\nceased to guide Freud's thought, the movement of the trace is described as an\neffort of life to protect itself by deferring the dangerous investment, by consti-\ntuting a reserve (Vorrat). And all the oppositions that furrow Freudian thought\nrelate each of his concepts one to another as moments of a detour in the economy\nof diff\u00e9rance.

This\nis a condition for the analytic of Dasein, which is there through the opening to\nthe question of the meaning of Being, through the precomprehension of Being;\ntemporality constitutes the \"Being of a Being-there (Dasein) which comprehends\nBeing,\" and it is the \"ontological meaning of care\" as the structure of Dasein.\nThis is why temporality alone can provide the horizon for the question of Being.\nThus the task assigned to Being and Time is to be understood as both preliminary\nand urgent.

Now, although the Hegelian concept\nof time is submitted to scrutiny, and several pages are devoted to it, Heidegger\ngrants only a footnote to the pertinent traits that assign a Greek, and very\nprecisely an Aristotelian, origin to this concept. The footnote invites several\nreadings. Here we do not aspire to undertake such readings, or even to sketch\nthem out. Rather, we are simply underlining the fact that they are indicated,\nand then opening the texts that Heidegger signals, marking their pages. Our\nonly ambition in commenting on this note is to attempt to extend it a bit, and\nto do so according to two motifs.\n1. To read in it, such as it is announced in highly determined form,6 the\nHeideggerian question about presence as the ontotheological determination of\n6. The following pages may be read as timid prologomena to a problem of translation.\nBut who better than Heidegger has taught us to think what is involved in such a problem?\nHere, the question would be the following: how to transfer into, or rather what transpires\nwhen we transfer into the single Latin word presence the entire differentiated system of\nGreek and German words, the entire system of translation in which Heideggerian language\n(ousia. parousia, Gegenwartigkeit, Anwesen, Anwesenheit, Vorhandenheit, etc.) is produced?\nAnd all this taking into account that the two Greek words, and the words associated with\nthem, already have translations charged with history (essence, substance, etc.)? Above\nall, how to transfer into the single word presence, both too rich and too poor, the history\nof the Heideggerian text which associates or disjoins these concepts in subtle and regular\nfashion throughout an itinerary that covers more than forty years? How to translate into\nFrench [Englishi or translate French [English] into the play of these displacements? To take\nonly one example__but one which has a privileged status here\u2014\"The Anaximander Frag-\nment\" (1946) rigorously dissociates concepts which all signify presence, and which, in the\ntext of Being and Time that we have just cited, were aligned as synonyms, or in any case\nwithout pointing out any pertinent trait of difference. Let us cut out a page from \"The\nAnaximander Fragment.\" We will cite it in translation, inserting the German words which\nbear the burden of the difficulties even in places where the translator might not be obliged\nto do so: \"The first point we gather from this poetic phrase is that ta eonta is distinguished\nfrom ta essomena and pro eonta. Thus ta eonta designates being in the sense of the present\n(das Seiende im Sinne des Gegenwartigen). When we moderns speak of 'the present,' we either\nmean what is 'now' (das Jetzige)\u2014which we represent as something within time (etwas\n:nnerzeitiges), the 'now' serving as a phase in the stream of time\u2014or we bring the 'present'\ninto relation with the 'objective' (zum Gegenstandigen). As something objective (das Ob-\njective), an object is related to a representing subject. However, if we employ 'present' (das\n'gegernv\u00e4rtig') for the sake of a closer determination of eonta, then we must understand\n'the present' (das 'gegenwartig') from the essence (Wesen) of eonta and not vice versa. Yet\neonta is also what is past and what is to come. Both are ways of presencing (des Anwesenden),\ni.e. the presencing of what is not presently present (des ungegenw\u00e4rtig Anwesenden). The\nGreeks also named more precisely what is presently present (das gegenwartig Anwesende)\nIn pareonta, pam meaning 'alongside' (be:), in the sense of coming alongside in uncon-\ncealment (Unverborgenheit). The gegen in gegenu'\u00e4rtig (presently) does not mean something\nover against a subject, but rather an open expanse of unconcealment (die offene Gegend der\nUnverborgenheit), into which and within which whatever comes along lingers (das Beige-\nkommene vertt'eilt). Accordingly, as a characteristic of eonta, 'presently' (gegenwartig) means\nas much 'having arrived to linger awhile in the expanse of unconcealment.' Spoken first,\nand thus emphasized, eon Ia which is expressly distinguished from proeonta and essomena,\nnames for the Greeks what is present (das Anwesende) insofar as it has arrived in the\ndesignated sense, to linger within the expanse of unconcealment. Such a coming is proper\narnval, the presencing of what is properly present. (Solche Angekom:nenheit ist die eigentliche\n33\n"

We\nwill see that it already promises the second volume of Being and Time, but that\nit does so, we might say, by reserving the second volume, both as something\nstill to be unfolded and as the definitive enveloping of the first.\nThe Note belongs to the next to last section of the last chapter (\"Temporality\nand Within-Time-ness as the Source of the Ordinary Conception of Time\"). Time\nis usually considered as that in which beings are produced. Within-time-ness,\nintratemporality, is taken to be the homogenous medium in which the movement\nof daily existence is reckoned and organized. This homogeneity of the temporal\nmedium becomes the effect of a \"leveling off of primordial time\" (Nivellierung\nder ursprunglichen Zeit), and constitutes a world time more objective than the\nobject and more subjective than the subject. In affirming that history\u2014that is,\nspirit, which alone has a history\u2014falls into time (.\n.\n. f/lilt die Entwicklung der\nGeschichte in die Zeit),'\u00b0 is not Hegel thinking in terms of the vulgar concept of\ntime? Heidegger claims to be in agreement with Hegel on this proposition in its\n\"results\" (im Resultat), and to the extent that it concerns the temporality of Dasein\nand the co-belonging that links Dasein to world time (p. 457).\" But Heidegger\nagrees only with the proposition in its results, and Hegel himself has taught us\nthat results are nothing without their becoming, outside the locus which assigns\nto them an itinerary or a method. Now, Heidegger wants to show in what way\nhis project of fundamental ontology displaces the meaning of this result, thus\nthaking the Hegelian proposition appear as the \"most radical\" formulation of\nthe vulgar concept of time. He is concerned not with \"criticizing\" Hegel but\nwith sharpening the difference between fundamental ontology and classical or\nuse related to differance.

We will have occasion to ask whether or not this agreement about the \"results,\"\nwhich keeps to a description of \"fallen temporality,\" engages Heidegger in something\nbeyond the limits that he seeks to mark here. Despite the reinterpretation to which he\nsubmits the Verfallen (for example at the end of section 82), it will be asked whether the\nsingle distinction\u2014whatever its restructuration and originality\u2014between proper and im-\nproper temporality, authentic, orginary and nonoriginary, etc., is not itself a tributary of\nHegelianism, of the idea of a \"fall\" into time.

Hegel's interpretation of the relation between time and spirit operates on\nthe basis of a concept of time elaborated in the second part of the Encyclopedia,\nthat is, in a philosophy of nature. This concept belongs to an ontology of nature,\nand has the same milieu and characteristics as the Aristotelian concept of time\nsuch as it is constructed in Physics IV, in the course of a reflection on place and\nmovement.\n-\n2. The \"leveling\" of which Heidegger speaks is due here to the exorbitant\nprivilege of the form of the \"now\" and the \"point.\" As Hegel himself says: \"The\nnow has a tremendous right (em\nungeheures Recht); it is nothing as the individual\nNow, for as I pronounce it, this proudly exclusive Now dissolves, flows away\nand falls into dust.\"2\n3.

It intervenes at the end of the subsection\ndevoted to the Hegelian exposition of the concept of time in the philosophy of\nnature and before the subsection of \"Hegel's Interpretation of the Connection\nbetween Time and Spirit.\" Let us follow its translation:\nThe priority which Hegel has given to the 'now' which has been levelled\noff, makes it plain that in defining the concept of time he is under the\nsway of the manner in which time is ordinarily understood; and this\nmeans that he is likewise under the sway of the traditional conception of\nit. It can even be shown that his conception of time has been drawn di-\nrectly from the 'physics' of Aristotle.\nIn the lena Logic (Cf. C. Lasson's 1923 edition), which was projected at\nthe time of Hegel's habilitation, the analysis of time which we find in his\nEncyclopedia has already been developed in all its essential parts. Even the\nroughest examination reveals that the section on time (pp. 202 ff.) is a\nparaphrase of Aristotle's essay on time.

Hegel discusses the concept of time in conjunction with defining\nthe concepts of aether and motion. Here too his analysis of space comes\nlater (nachgeordnet). Though the dialectic already emerges, it does not\nhave as yet the rigid schematic form which it will have afterward, but\nstill makes it possible to understand the phenomena in a fairly relaxed\nmanner. On the way from Kant to Hegel's developed system, the impact\nof the Aristotelian ontology and logic has again been decisive. The Fact of\nthis impact has long been well known. But the kind of effect it has had,\nthe path it has taken, even its limitations, have hitherto been as obscure\nas the Fact itself has been familiar. A concrete philosophical Interpretation\ncomparing Hegel's Jena Logic with the 'physics' and 'metaphysics' of Aris-\ntotle will bring new light. For the above considerations, some rough sug-\ngestions will suffice.\nAristotle sees the essence of time in the nun, Hegel in the 'now' (jetzt).\nAristotle takes the nun as oros; Hegel takes the 'now' as 'boundary'\n(Grenze). Aristotle understands the nun as Stigrne; Hegel interprets the\n'now' as a point. Aristotle describes the nun as lode Ii; Hegel calls the\n'now' the 'absolute this' (das 'absolute Dieses'). Aristotle follows tradition\nin connecting khronos with sphaira; Hegel stresses the 'circular course'\n(Kreislauf) of time. To be sure, Hegel escapes the central tendency of the\nAristotelian analysis\u2014the tendency to expose a foundational connection\n(akolouthein) between the nun, the oros, the stigrne and the tode ti.\nIn its result, Bergson's view is in accord with Hegel's thesis that space\n'is' time, in spite of the very different reasons they have given. Bergson\nmerely says the\nthat time (temps (in French in the text in order to\noppose tern ps, time, to dur\u00e9e, durationj) is space. Bergson's view of time\ntoo has obviously arisen from an Interpretation of the Aristotelian essay\non time. That a treatise of Bergson with the title Quid Aristoteles de loco\nsenserit should have appeared at the same time as his Essai sur les donn\u00e9es\nimm\u00e9diates de la conscience, where the problem of tern ps and dur\u00e9e is ex-\npounded, is not just a superficial literary connection. Having regard to\nAristotle's definition of time as the arithmos kin\u00ebseOs, Bergson prefaces his\nanalysis of time with an analysis of number. Time as space (Cf. Essai, p.\n69) is quantitative Succession. By a counter-orientation (Gegenorientierung)\nto this conception of time, duration gets described as a qualitative Succes-\nsion. This is not the place for coming to terms critically (Auseinanderset-\nzung) with Bergson's conception of time or with other Present-day views\nof it. So far as anything essential has been achieved in today's analyses\nwhich will take us beyond Aristotle and Kant, it pertains more to the\nway time is grasped and to our 'consciousness of time'.

Time rel\u00e8ve [\"relifts\"]'5 space.\nIn recalling this development, Heidegger underlines that in this way space\nis only thought as time (p. 482). Space is time to the extent that space is determined\non the basis of the (first or last) negativity of the point. \"According to Hegel,\nthis negation of the negation as punctuality is time\" (p. 482). Time, therefore,\nis thought on the basis of, or looking toward, the point, and the point is thought\non the basis of, or looking toward, time. Point and time are thought in this\ncircularity which relates them one to the other.

It is that being\nwhich, inasmuch as it is, is not, and inasmuch as it is not, is: it is Becoming\ndirectly intuited (das angeschaute Werden); this means that differences, which\nadmittedly are purely momentary, i.e. directly self-sublating (unmittelbar sich\naufhebenden Unterschiede), are determined as external, i.e. as external to them-\nselves\" (p. 34).\nThis definition has at least three direct consequences in Hegel's text considered\nas a paraphrase of Aristotle.\n1. The Kantian concept of time is reproduced in it, or rather is deduced from\nit. The necessity of such a deduction would show, then, that the Kantian rev-\nolution did not displace what Aristotle had set down but, on the contrary, settled\ndown there itself, changing its locale and then refurbishing it. Further on we\nwill come to suggest this from another point of view. In effect, \"intuited becom-\ning\" in itself, without empirical sensory content, is the purely sensory, the formal\nsensory free from all sensuous matter, without whose discovery no Copernican\nrevolution would have taken place. What Kant discovered is the \"non-sensuous\nsensuous\" that here reproduces the \"paraphrase\" of Aristotle: \"Time, like space,\nis a pure form of sense or of intuition, the non-sensuous sensuous (das unsinnliche\nSinnliche)\" (Enc., sec. 258, Remark, p. 34). In alluding to this \"nonsensuously\nsensuous,\"17 Heidegger does not relate the Hegelian concept to its Kantian equiv-\nalent; it is well known that he considered Hegel to have covered over and erased\nKant's audaciousness in many respects. Are we not justified here, Heidegger\nnotwithstanding, in placing Kant in the direct line which, according to Heidegger,\nleads from Aristotle to Hegel?\n2. According to an elaboration which resembles that found in Kant and the\nProblem of Metaphysics (and consequently, Being and Time), Hegel concludes from\nhis definition:\na) \"Time is the same principle as the I = I of pure self-consciousness\" (ibid.).\nWe would have to relate\u2014although we cannot do so here\u2014the entire Remark\nof section 258 of the Encyclopedia, which demonstrates this last proposition, to\nsection 34 of Heidegger's Kant, particularly to the section on \"Time as Pure Self-\nAffection and the Temporal Character of the\nwhen he writes, for example\nare\nwith respect to movement .\n. .

And in effect this is where the entire question would\nhave to reside.\nWhat the Question Evades\nUntil now we have remained, in a way, within the first hypothesis of the Aris-\ntotelian aporetic, which began by paralyzing itself in the determination of time\nas nun and of nun as meros (part).\nOur question, then, is the following: in overturning the hypothesis, in dem-\nonstrating that the now is not a part of time, does Aristotle extract the problematic\nhere\n-\nbetw en the npw .(.Jetzl) and\nPure presence,irffinite parousia,\naccording to Hegel, then, would not be governed by the now which Heidegger tells us\nlimits and determines parousia from the Physics to the Encyclopedia. But, since Heidegger\nalso is questioning a privilege of the Gegenwart , here we ought to delve into the differences\nbetween Jetzt, Gegenwart, Anwesenheit. Again under the rubric of a preliminary survey, let\nus be satisfied, here, with translating Hegel's text: \"The dimensions of time, present (Ge-\nfuture, and past, are the becoming of externality as such, and the resolution\n(Auflosung) of it into the differences of being as passing over into nothing, and of nothing\nas passing over into being. The immediate vanishing of these differences into singularity\nis the present as Now (die Gegenwart als Jetzt) which, as singularity, is exclusive of the other\nmoments, and at the same time completely continues in them, and is only this vanishing\nof its being into nothing and of nothing into its being.\n\"The finite present (die endliche Gegenwart) is the Now as being and distinguished as the\nconcrete unity, and hence as the affirmative, from what is negative, from the abstract\nmoments of past and future; but this being is itself only abstract, vanishing into nothing.\nFurthermore, in Nature, where time is a Now, being does not reach the existence of the\ndifference of these dimensions; they are of necessity only in subjective imagination (Vor-\nstellung), in remembrance and fear and hope. But the past and future of time as being in\nNature are space, for space is negated time; just as sublated (aufgehobene) space is im-\nmediately the point, which developed for itself is time\" (Enc., sec. 259, p. 37). These\ntexts\u2014and several others\u2014seem both to confirm and to challenge the interpretation in\nBeing and Time. The confirmation is evident. The challenge complicates things at the point\nat which the present is distinguished from the now, at which the now, in its purity, belongs\nonly to nature and is not yet time, etc. In a word, it would be quite hasty and an over-\nsimplification to say that the Hegelian concept of time is borrowed from a \"physics\" or\nfrom a \"philosophy of nature,\" and that in this way it essentially passes unchanged into\na \"philosophy,of spirit\" or into a \"philosophy of history.\" Time is also this passage itself.\nThe reading of Aristotle already would raise analogous questions.\nEvery affirmation (here, Heidegger's) according to which a concept, in Hegel, belongs\nto the philosophy of nature (or, in general, to a determined, particular site of the Hegelian\ntext) a priori is of limited pertinence due to the relevant Icf. aufhebcnl structure of the\nrelations between nature and non-nature in speculative dialectics.

It wifi have as little meaning in both cases.\nIn effect, as Aristotle says, it is because time does not belong to beings, is no\nmore a part of them than it is a determination of them, and because time is not\nof (phenomenal or\nbeing in general, that it must be made into a pure\nform of sensibility (the nonsensuous sensuous). This profound metaphysical\nfidelity is organized and arranged along with the break that recognizes time as the\ncondition for the possibility of the appearance of beings in (finite) experience,\ni.e., also along with that in Kant which will be repeated by Heidegger. In principle,\ntherefore, the text of Aristotle could always be submitted to what might be called\nthe \"generous repetition,\" the repetition from which Kant profits, but which is\ndenied Aristotle and Hegel, at least at the period of Being and Time. At a certain\npoint, then, the destruction of metaphysics remains within metaphysics, only\nmaking explicit its principles. This is a necessity that would have to be examined\nin terms of this example, and its rule would have to be formalized. Here, the Kantian\nbreak was prepared by Physics IV, and one could say as much for the Heideg-\ngerian \"re-edition\" of the Kantian gesture in Being and Time and in Kant and the\nProblem of Metaphysics.\nIn effect, if one compares the \"Transcendental Exposition of the Concept of\nTime\" to Physics IV, one quickly picks up this decisive common characteristic:\n\"Time is not something which exists of itself, or which inheres in things as an\nobjective determination, and it does not, therefore, remain when abstraction is\nmade of all subjective conditions of its\nIt may be said that this\ncharacteristic\u2014the nonbeingness in itself of time\u2014is very general, and that the\ncommunity of intention between Kant and Aristotle is quite limited.

These exist solely\nin Being-moved or in changing-Being, and are more or less slow or rapid, which\ncannot be the case with time. On the contrary, time makes possible movement,\nchange, their measurement, and differences of speed. Here time is what defines,\nand not what is defined (218b).\n2. Nevertheless, there is no time without movement. It is\nthat Aristotle\nlinks time to experience or to appearing (dianoia, psykhe, aisthesis). If time is not\nmovement, we nevertheless caimot experience time except by feeling and de-\ntermining a change or a movement. (Aristotle asserts that here the difference\nbetween movement and change is not pertinent and should not detain him\u2014\n218b.) \"Therefore it is clear that time neither is movement nor exists without it\"\n(219a).\nWhat is it then that relates time to what it is not, that is, to movement? What\nin movement determines time? One must seek in time ti t\u00ebs kineseOs estin, that\nis, in sum, what relates time to space, and to changes of place. And one must\nfind the concepts for this relationship.\nDiscreet, advanced without insistence, as if they went without saying, the\nfundamental categories, here, are those of analogy and correspondence. They lead\nback, by other names, and barely displacing it, to the enigma of the \"at the same\ntime,\" which both names and evades, states and obscures, the problem.\nMagnitude is continuous. This is axiomatic here. Now, movement follows the\norder of magnitude, corresponds to this order (akolouthei Wi megethei he kinesis).\nTherefore it is continuous. Further, anterior and posterior are local situations\n(en topaz). As such, they are within magnitude, and therefore, according to the\ncorrespondence or the analogy of magnitude and movement (219a), they are also\nwithin movement. And within time, since \"time and movement always corre-\nspond to each other\" (dia to akolouthein aei thateroi thateron aut\u00f6n). It follows,\nfinally, that time is continuous by analogy with movement and magnitude.\nThis leads to the definition of time as the number of movement following the\nbefore and the after (219ab). A definition made more specific, as is well known,\nby the distinction between the numbered number and the numbering number.

Thus,\none studies space, determines its nature and function, and then transports the conclusions\nthus obtained onto time. The theory of space and the theory of time thus become sym-\nmetrical.

It lets itself be numbered\nonly insofar as it has a relation to movement according to the before and after.\nThe unity of the measure of time numbered in this way is the now, which\npernuts the distinction between before and after. And it is because movement\nis determined according to the before and the after that the graphic linear rep-\nresentation of time is simultaneously required and exduded by Aristotle. This\ndetermination according to the anterior and the posterior \"corresponds,\" in\neffect, \"in a certain manner to the point\" (akolouthei de kai touto pos t\u00eai stigmei).\nThe point gives to length its continuity and its limit. The line is a continuity of\npoints. And each point is both an end and a beginning (arkh\u00eb kai teleuf\u00eb) for each\npart. Thus, one could be led to believe that the now is to time what the point\nis to the line. And that the essence of time can pass, intact and undamaged,\ninto its linear representation, into the continuous, extended unfolding of punc-\ntuality.\nAristotle firmly indicates that this is not so. The spatial and linear represen-\ntation, at least in this form, is inadequate. What is criticized, thereby, is not the\nrelationship of time to movement, nor the numbered or numerable Being of\ntime, but rather time's analogy with a certain structure of the gramme.\nIn effect, if one uses the point and the line to represent movement, one is\nmanipulating a multiplicity of points which are both origin and limit, beginning\nand end; this multiplicity of immobilities, this series (if it can be called such),\nof successive arrests, does not give time, and when Aristotle recalls this, his\nlanguage is indistinguishable from Bergson's:\". . . for the point both connects\nand limits the length\u2014it is the beginning of one and the end of another. But if\nyou consider the one point as two, an arrest or pause is necessary, if the same\npoint is to be both beginning and end\" (220a).\nIn this sense, the now is not the point, since it does not arrest time, is neither\ntime's origin, end, or limit. At least it is not a limit to the extent that it belongs\nto time. The importance of the to the extent that henceforth will become more\nspecific, and will do so unceasingly.\nWhat is rejected, then, is not the gramme as such, but the gramme as a series\nof points, as a composition of parts each of which would be an arrested limit.\nBut if one considers now that the point, as limit, does not exist in act, is not\n(present), exists only potentially and by accident, takes its existence only from\n59\n"

Only such a reading, on the condition that it does not give authority to the security\nor structural dosing off of questions, appears to us capable of undoing today, in France,\na profound complicity: the complicity which gathers together, in the same refusal to read,\nin the same denegation of the question, of the text, and of the question of the text, in the\nsame reeditions, or in the same blind silence, the camp of Heideggerian devotion and the\ncamp of anti-Heideggerianism. Here, political \"resistance\" often serves as a highly moral\nalibi for a \"resistance\" of an other order: philosophical resistance, for example, but there\nare other resistances whose political implications, although more distant, are no less\ndetermined.\n62\n"

      "full_text": "The Pit and the Pyramid\nThe theory of the signs belongs to the third moment, to the third part, of the\nphilosophy of spirit. It belongs to the science of the moment when the idea\ncomes back to itself after having, if we may put it thus, lost awareness, lost the\nconsciousness and meaning of itself in nature, in its Being-other. The sign, then,\nwill be an agency or essential structure of the Idea's return to self-presence. If\nspirit is the Idea's Being-near-to-itself, one already may identify the sign by its\nfirst, most general determination: the sign is a form or a movement of the Idea's\nrelation to itself in the element of spirit, a mode of the absolute's Being-near-to-\nitself.\nLet us narrow our angle of vision. Let us situate the theory of the sign more\nprecisely in the philosophy of spirit. The latter itself is articulated in three parts\nwhich correspond to the three movements of the development of spirit:\n1. Subjective spirit: the spirit's relation to itself, an only ideal totality of the\nIdea. This is Being-near-to-itself in the form of\nfreedom.\n2. Objective spirit, as a world to produce and produced in the form of reality,\nnot only ideality. Freedom here becomes an existing, present necessity (vor-\nhandene Notwendigkeit).\n3. Absolute spirit: the unity, that is in itself and for itself, of the objectivity of\nthe spirit and of its ideality or its concept, the unity producing itself eternally,\nspirit in its absolute truth\u2014absolute spirit (sec. 385, p. 20).\nThe first two moments, then, are finite and transitory determinations of spirit.\nNow, the discourse on the sign derives from the science of one of these finite\ndeterminations: subjective spirit. If one recalls that, according to Hegel, \"the\nfinite is not, i.e., is not the truth, but merely a transition (Ubergegen) and an\nemergence (Ubersichhinausgehen: a transgression of itself)\" (sec. 386, p. 23), then\nthe sign indeed appears as a mode or determination of subjective and finite\nspirit as a mediation or transgression of itself, a transition within the transition,\na transition of the transition. But this way out of itself is the obligatory route of\na return to itself. It is conceived under the jurisdiction and in the form of\ndialectics, according to the movement of the true, and is watched over by the\nconcepts of Aufhebung and negativity. \"This finitude of the spheres so far ex-\namined is the dialectic that makes a thing have its cessation ( Vergehen) by another\nand in another\" (p. 23).\nLet us define the place of this semiology more closely. Subjective spirit itself\nis:\n1. in itself or immediate: this is the soul or natural-spirit (Natur-Geist), the object\nof the anthropology that studies man in nature;\n2. for itself or mediate, as an identical reflection in itself and in the other, spirit\nin relation or particularization (im Verh\u00e4ltnis oder Besonderung), consciousness, the\nobject of the phenomenology of spirit;\n3. spirit determining itself in itself, as a subject for itself, the object of psychology\n(sec. 387, p. 25).\n74\n"

Let us note, nevertheless\u2014although this cannot\ndetain us here\u2014that semiology, as part of the science of the subject which is for\nitself, does not belong to the science of consciousness, that is, to phenomenology.\nThis topical scheme, which inscribes semiology in a non-natural science of the\nsoul, and properly in a psychology, in no way upsets a long traditional sequence,\nor at least does not do so in this way. The topical arrangement not only takes\nus back to the numerous semiological projects of the Middle Ages or the eigh-\nteenth century, which are all, directly or not, psychologi s, but also to Aristotle.\nAristotle is the model claimed by Hegel for his philosophy of spirit, and spe-\ncifically for his psychology: \"The books of Aristotle on the Soul, along with his\ndiscussions on its special aspects and states, are for this reason still by far the\nmost admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this\ntopic. The main aim of a philosophy of mind [spirit] can only be to reintroduce\nunity of idea and principle into the theory of mind, and so reinterpret the lesson\nof those Aristotelian books\" (sec. 378, p. 3).\nit is Aristotle, precisely, who developed his interpretation of the voice in a\ntreatise Pen Psukhes (which will count for us in a moment), and who, in Pen\nHernieneias, defined signs, symbols, speech and writing on the basis of the\npathemafa t\u00ebs psukhes, the states, affections or passions of the soul. Let us recall\nthe well known opening of Pen Herrneneias: \"Spoken words (ta en t\u00ebi phOnei) are\nthe symbols of mental experience and written words are the symbols of spoken\nwords. Just as all men have not the same writing so all men have not the same\nspeech sounds, but the mental experiences, which these directly symbolize [are\nsigns of in the first place: s\u00ebmeia protos] are the same for all [which is precisely\nwhat permits a science of them] as also are those things of which our experiences\nare the images. This matter has, however, been discussed in my treatise about\nthe soul.\"4\nThe traditional repetition of the gesture by means of which semiology is made\nto proceed from psychology is not only the past of Hegelianism. Often that\nwhich purports to be a surpassing of Hegelianism, and sometimes a science free\nof metaphysics, still conforms to it.\nThis necessary gesture, which is properly metaphysical and governs an entire\nconcatenation of discourses from Aristotle to 1-legel, will not be challenged by\nthe author considered as the founder of the first great project of general and\nscientific semiology, the model for so many modem, social sciences. Twice at\nleast, in the Course on Genera! Linguistics, Saussure places his plan for a general\nsemiology under the jurisdiction of psychology: \"Everything in language is\nbasically psychological including its material and mechanical manifestations,\nsuch as sound changes; and since linguistics provides social psychology with\n4.

Semiology would show what constitutes signs,\nand what laws govern them. Since the science does not yet exist, no one can\nsay what it will be; but it has a right to existence, a place staked out in advance.\nLinguistics is only a part of the general science of semiology; the laws discovered\nby semiology will be applicable to linguistics, and the latter will circumscribe a\nwell defined area within the mass of anthropological facts.

Instead of\nsubstantially separating faculties and psychic structures, then, one must deter-\nmine their mediations, articulations, and joinings, which constitute the unity\nof an organized and oriented movement. Now it is remarkable that the theory\nof the sign, which essentially consists of an interpretation of speech and writing,\nis put forth in two long Remarks, remarks much longer than the paragraphs to\nwhich they are affixed, in the subchapter \"Imagination\" (Die Einbildungskraft,\nsecs. 445\u201460).\nSemiology, then, is a part of the theory of the imagination, and more precisely,\nas we shall specify, of a phantasiology or a fantastics.\nWhat is imagination?\nRepresentation (Vorstellung) is remembered-interiorized (erinnerte) intuition.\nIt properly belongs to intelligence (Intelligenz), whose action is to interiorize\nsensible immediacy in order \"itself to pose itself as having an intuition of itself\n(sich in sich selbst anschauend zu setzen).\" Sensible immediacy remaining uni-\nlaterally subjective, the movement of intelligence must, by Aufhebung, lift and\n5.

In this movement of representation, intelligence recalls itself\nto itself in becoming objective. Erinnerung, thus, is decisive here. By means of\nErinnerung the content of sensible intuition becomes an image, freeing itself from\nimmediacy and singularity in order to permit the passage to conceptuality. The\nimage thus interiorized in memory (erinnert) is no longer there, no longer existent\nor present, but preserved in an unconscious dwelling, conserved without con-\nsciousness (bewusstlos, aufbewahrt). Intelligence keeps these images in reserve,\nsubmerged at the bottom of a very dark shelter, like the water in a nightlike or\nunconscious pit (n\u00e4chtliche Schacht, bewusstlose Schacht), or rather like a precious\nvein at the bottom of the mine. \"But intelligence is not only consciousness and\nactual existence, but qua intelligence is the subject and potentiality of its own\nspecializations. The image when thus kept in mind [erinnert] is no longer existent,\nbut stored up out of consciousness\" (sec. 453, p. 204).\nA path, which we will follow, leads from this night pit, silent as death and\nresonating with all the powers of the voice which it holds in reserve, to a pyramid\nbrought back from the Egyptian desert which soon will be raised over the sober\nand abstract weave of the Hegelian text, there composing the stature and status\nof the sign. And there, the natural source and the historical construction both,\nthough differently, remain silent. That the path, following the ontotheological\nroute, still remains circular, and that the pyramid becomes once again the pit\nthat it always will have been\u2014such is the enigma. We will have to ask if this\nenigma is to be sought out, like truth speaking by itself from the bottom of a\nwell, or if it is to be deciphered, like an unverifiable inscription left behind on\nthe facade of a monument.\nOnce in possession of this pit, this reservoir (Vorrat), intelligence then can\ndraw from it, can bring to light, produce, \"give forth its property (Eigentum),\nand dispense with external intuition for its existence in it. This synthesis of the\ninternal image with the recollected existence (erinnert'u Jasein) is representation\nproper (die eigentliche Vorstellung): by this synthesis the internal now has the\nqualification of being able to be presented before intelligence (vor die Intelligenz\ngestellt werden zu konnen) and to have its existence in it\" (sec. 454, p. 205). The\nimage no longer belongs to \"the simple night.\"7\n7. In a work in preparation on Hegel's family and on sexual difference in the dialectical\nspeculative economy, we will bring to light the organization and displacement of this chain\nwhich reassembles the values of night, sepulcher, and divine\u2014familial\u2014feminine law as\nthe law of singularity\u2014and does so around the pit and the pyramid. A citation as a\ntouchstone: \"But if the universal thus easily knocks off the very tip of the pyramid (die\nreme Spitze seiner Pyrarnide) and, indeed, carries off the victory over the rebellious principle\nof pure individuality, viz., the Family, it has thereby merely entered on a conflict with the\ndivine law, a conflict of self-conscious Spirit with what is unconscious. For the latter is the\nother essential power, and is therefore not destroyed, but merely wronged (beleidigt) by\nthe conscious Spirit. But it has pnly the bloodless shade to help it in actually carrying out\nits law in face of the power and authority of that other, publicly manifest law. Being the\nlaw of weakness and darkness it therefore at first succumbs to the powerful law of the\nupper world, for the power of the former is effective in the underworld, not on earth.\"\nHegel, Phenoinenotogy of Spirit, trans. A. V. Miller (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977), p. 286.\nIThe work in preparation has since appeared: Glas.J\n77\n"

      "full_text": "The Pit and the Pyramid\nHegel evidently defines it as an ideality, in opposition to the corporality of an\nintuitive signifier. This ideality is that of a Bedeutung. This word is usually trans-\nlated as \"signification.\" Having attempted, in commenting elsewhere upon the\nLogical Researches,'\u00b0 to interpret it as the content of a meaning, I would like to\ndemonstrate here that such an interpretation is also valid for the Hegelian text.\nSuch an extension is regulated by an internal and essential metaphysical ne-\ncessity.\nHegel accords to the content of this meaning, this Bedeutung, the name and\nrank of soul (Seele). Of course it is a soul deposited in a body, in the body of the\nsignifier, in the sensory flesh of intuition. The sign, as the unity of the signifying\nbody and the signified ideality, becomes a kind of incarnation. Therefore the\nopposition of soul and body, and analogically the opposition of the intelligible\nand the sensory, condition the difference between the signified and the signifier,\nbetween the signifying intention (bedeuten), which is an-animating activity, and\nthe inert body of the signifier. This will remain true for Saussure; and also for\nHusserl, who sees the body of the sign as animated by the intention of signi-\nfication, just as a body (K\u00f6rper) when inhabited by Geist becomes a proper body\n(Leib). Husserl says of the living word that it is a geistige' Leiblichkeit, a spiritual\nflesh.\nHegel knew that this proper and animated body of the signifier was also a\ntomb. The association s\u00f6ma/s\u00ebma is also at work in this semiology, which is in no\nway\nThe tomb is the life of the body as the sign of death, the body\nas the other of the soul, the other of the animate psyche, of the living breath.\nBut the tomb also shelters, maintains in reserve, capitalizes on life by marking\nthat life continues elsewhere. The family crypt: oikfsis.'2 It consecrates the dis-\nappearance of life by attesting to the perseverance of life. Thus, the tomb also\nshelters life from death. It warns the soul of possible death, warns (of) death of\nthe soul, turns away (from) death. This double warning function belongs to the\nfunerary monument. The body of the sign thus becomes the monument in which\nthe soul will be enclosed, preserved, maintained, kept in maintenance, present,\n10. TN. See Derrida, Speech and Phenomena, for this argument.\n11. P. Hochart\u2014my thanks to him here\u2014since then has directed my attention to the\nfollowing passage from the Cratylus, a passage less frequently cited and more interesting\nfor us than the celebrated text of the Gorgias (493a) on the couple sOrna/s\u00ebma. \"Socrates:\nYou mean 'body' (soma)?\u2014Hermogenes: Yes.\u2014Soc.: I think this admits of many expla-\nnations, if a little, even very little, change is made; for some say it is the toni!.' (s\u00eb,na) of\nthe soul, their notion being that the soul is buried in present life; and again, because by\nits means the soul gives any signs which it gives (s\u00ebmainei ha an\nnC psukhei), it is\nfor this also properly called 'sign' (s\u00ebma). But I think it most likely that the Orphic poets\ngave this name, with the Idea that the soul is undergoing punishment for something; they\nthink it has the body for an enclosure to keep it safe, like a prison, and this is, as the\nname itself denotes, the safe (sown, prison) for the soul until the penalty is paid, and not\neven a letter needs to be changed.\" Plato, Collected Works in Twelve Volunzes, vol. 4 (Cam-\nbridge: Harvard University Press, 1926), p. 63.\n12.

At the heart of this monument the soul keeps itself alive, but it needs\nthe monument only to the extent that it is exposed\u2014to death\u2014in its living\nrelation to its own body.

The pyramid be-\ncomes the semaphor of the sign, the signifier of signification. Which is not an\nindifferent fact. Notably as concerns the Egyptian connotation: further on, the\nEgyptian hieroglyphic will furnish the example of that which resists the move-\nment of dialectics, history and logos. Is this contradictory?\nFirst, let us assist at the erection of the pyramid.\n\"In this unity (initiated by intelligence) of an independent representation\n(selbstandiger Vorstellung) with an intuition, the matter of the latter is, in the first\ninstance, something accepted (em\nAufgenommenes), something immediate or\ngiven (for example, the color of the cockade, etc.). But in the fusion of the two\nelements, the intuition does not count positively or as representing itself, but\nas representative of something else\" (sec. 458, p. 212).\nThus we have, for once, a kind of intuition of absence, or more precisely the\nsighting of an absence through a full intuition.\n\"It [this intuition) is an image, which has received [in sic!: empfangen hat: has\nreceived, welcomed, conceived, as a woman would conceive by receiving; and\nwhat is conceived here is indeed a concept] as its soul and meaning an independent\nmental representation, its signification (Bedeutung). This intuition is the Sign\"\n(sec. 458, p. 213).\nThere follows one of the two Remarks which contain the entire theory of the\nsign (which will not prevent Hegel, later, from cirticizing those who grant sem-\niology only the site and status of an appendix). \"The sign is some immediate\nintuition, representing a totally different import from what naturally belongs to\nit (die einen ganz anderen Inhalt vorstellt, als den sie f\u00fcr sic!: hat\" (ibid.). Vorstellen,\nwhich is generally translated as \"to represent,\" whether in the vaguest sense\nof intellectual or psychic representation, or in the sense of the representation\nof an object that is put forth to be seen, here also marks the representative detour,\nthe recourse to what represents, to what is put in the place of the other, the\ndelegate of and reference to the other. Here, an intuition is mandated to rep-\nresent, in its proper content, an entirely other content. \"The sign is some im-\nmediate intuition, representing a totally different import from what naturally\nbelongs to it; it is the pyramid [Hegel's emphasis) into which a foreign soul (eine\nfremde Seele) has been conveyed [transposed, transplanted, translated: versetzt;\nversetzten is also to place on deposit; in: Leihause z'ersetzten: to place in the pawn-\n83\n"

Hegel emphasizes this het-\nerogeneity, the condition for the arbitrariness of the sign, twice.\n1. The soul consigned to the pyramid is foreign (fremd). If it is transposed,\ntransplanted into the monument like an immigrant, it is that it is not made of\nthe stone of the signifier; neither in its origin nor its destination does it belong\nto the matter of the intuitive given. This heterogeneity amounts to the irreduc-\nibility of the soul and the body, of the intelligible and the sensory, of the concept\nor signified ideality on the one hand, and of the signifying body on the other,\nthat is, in different senses, the irreducibility of two representations (Vorstellungen).\n2. This is why the immediate intuition of the signifier represents an entirely\nother content (einen ganz anderen Inhalt) than that which it has for itself, entirely\nother than that whose full presence refers only to itself.\nThis relationship of absolute alterity distinguishes the sign from the symbol.\nThe continuity of a mimetic or analogical participation can always be seen be-\ntween the symbol and the symbolized. \"The sign is different from the symbol:\nfor in the symbol the original characters (in essence and conception) of the visible\nobject are more or less identical with the import which it bears as symbol;\nwhereas in the sign, strictly so-called, the natural attributes of the intuition, and\nthe connotation of which it is a sign, have nothing to do with one another\"\n(ibid.).\nThe motif of the arbitrariness of the sign, the distinction between sign and\nsymbol, is clarified at length in the \"Introduction\" to the section of the Aesthetics\ndevoted to \"Symbolic Art.\" There, Hegel specifies the \"purely arbitrary linkage\"\n(ganz willkurliche Verknupfung) which constitutes the sign itself, and above all the\nlinguistic sign. \"Therefore it is a different thing when a sign is to be a symbol.\nThe lion, for example, is taken as a symbol of magnanimity, the fox of cunning,\nthe circle of eternity, the triangle of Trinity. But the lion and the fox do possess\nin themselves the very qualities whose significance (Bedeutung) they are sup-\nposed to express. Similarly the circle does not exhibit the endlessness or the\ncapricious limitation of a straight or other line, which does not return into itself,\na limitation likewise appropriate enough for some limited space of time; and the\ntriangle as a whole has the same number of sides and angles as that appearing\nin the idea of God when the determinations which religion apprehends in God\nare liable to numeration.\n84\n"

The\nPyramids are such an external environment in which an inner meaning rests\nconcealed\" (Aesth. I, p. 356).\nThis requisite discontinuity between the signified and the signifier coincides\nwith the systemic necessity that includes semiology in a psychology. It will be\nrecalled, in effect, that psychology\u2014.in the Hegelian sense\u2014is the science of the\nspirit determining itself in itself, as a subject for itself. This is the moment at\nwhich \"all [spirit] now has to do is to realize the notion of its freedom\" (Ency-\nclopedia, sec. 440, p. 179). This is why it was indispensable, above, to assert the\narchitectonic articulation between psychology and semiology. This allows us\nbetter to comprehend the meaning of arbitrariness: the production of arbitrary\nsigns manifests the freedom of the spirit. And there is more 'manifest freedom\nin the production of the sign than in the production of the symbol. In the sign\nspirit is more independent and closer to itself. In the symbol, conversely, it is\na bit more exiled into nature. \"Intelligence therefore gives proof of wider choice\n(Willkur) and ampler authority (Herrschaft) in the use of intuitions when it treats\nthem as designatory (als bezeichnend) rather than as symbolical (als symbolisierend)\"\n(Enc. sec. 458, p. 213)14\nAccording to the framework of this teleology, the semiotic instance, just de-\nfined as abstract rationality, also helps impel the manifestation of freedom. Hence\nits essential place in the development of psychology and logic. Hegel marks this\nplace accessorily, in the middle of the Remark added as a long appendix to the\nshort paragraph that defines the sign. The pyramid had emerged in this space\nand along the detour of this digression: \"In logic and psychology, signs and\nlanguage are usually foisted in somewhere as an appendix (Anhang: supplement,\n14. Hegel already inherited this opposition of sign and symbol and the teleology which\nsystematically orients it. This could be easily demonstrated on the basis of each of the\nconcepts that enter into play here. But after Hegel the same opposition and the same\nteleology maintain their authority. For example in the Course in General Linguistics. In the\nfirst chapter of the first part in the section entitled: \"Principle I: The Arbitrary Nature of\nthe Sign\" one may read: \"Signs that are wholly arbitrary realize better than the others the\nideal of the semiological process; that is why language, the most complex and universal\nof all systems of expression, is also the most characteristic; in this sense linguistics can\nbecome the master-pattern for all branches of semiology although language is only one\nparticular semiological system.\" [We will soon find the same proposition in 1-legel, at the\nmoment when he grants preeminence to the linguistic sign, to speech and the name.]\n\"The word symbol has been used to designate the linguistic sign, or more specifically, what\nis here called the signifier. Principle I in particular weighs against the use of this term.\nOne characteristic of the symbol is that it is never wholly arbitrary; it is not empty, for\nthere is the rudiment of a natural bond between the signifier and the signified. The symbol\nof justice, a pair of scales, could not be replaced by just another symbol, such as a chariot\"\n(Course, p. 68).\n86\n"

We will now examine this relationship\nbetween a certain movement of idealizing interiorization and the process of\ntemporalization. In the production of signs, memory and imagination (that is,\ntime, in this context) are the same interiorization of the spirit relating itself to\nitself in the pure intuition of itself, and therefore in its freedom, and bringing\nthis intuition of itself to exterior existence.\nWhich calls for two comments.\n1. Appearing in the Encyclopedia under the heading of imagination, the theory\nof signs is immediately followed by the chapter on memory. In the Philosophical\nPro pedeutics the same semiological content is inscribed under the rubric of mem-\nory.15\n2. Memory, the production of signs, is also thought itself. In a transitional\nremark between the chapter devoted to memory and the chapter devoted to\nthought, Hegel recalls that the \"German language has etymologically assigned\nmemory (Gedachtnis), of which it has become a foregone conclusion to speak\ncontemptuously, the high position of direct kindred with thought (Gedanke)\"\n(Enc., sec. 464, p. 223).\n15. In the \"Philosophical Encyclopedia\" of the Propedeutics (first section of the \"Science\nof Spirit,\" chapter on representation, subchapter on memory) we find again the following\ndefinitions: \"1. The sign in general. Representation having been liberated from present\nexternal reality and rendered subjective, this reality and the internal representation are\nsituated one facing the other, as two distinct things. An external reality becomes a sign\nwhen it is arbitrarily associated with a representation which does not correspond to it, and\nwhich is even distinct from it in its content, such that this reality must be its representation\nor signification\" (sec. 155). \"Creative Memory therefore produces the association between\nintuition and representation, but a free association in which the preceding relationship,\nin which representation reposed upon intuition, finds itself inversed. In the association\nas effected by creative memory, the present sensuous reality has no value in itself and for\nitself, but its sole value is that conferred upon it by spirit\" (sec. 156). \"Language. The\nhighest work of creative memory is language, which is on the one hand verbal and on the\nother handwritten. Creative memory, or mnemosvn\u00eb. being the source of language, it can\nbe a question of another source only as far as what concerns the discovery of determined\nsigns. (sec. 158). Language is the disappearance of the sensuous world in its immediate\npresence, the suppression of this world, henceforth transformed into a presence which\nis a call apt to awaken an echo in every essence capable of representation\" (sec. 159).\nPhilosophische Proplideutik, in S\u00e4mtliche Werke, vol. 3 (Stuttgart: Frommans Verlag), pp.\n209\u201410.\n87\n"

The language of sound, speech,\nwhich carries the inside to the outside, does not simply abandon it there, as\ndoes writing. Conserving the inside in itself as it is in the act of emitting it to\nthe outside, speech is par excellence that which confers existence, presence\n(Dasein), upon the interior representation, making the concept (the signified)\nexist. But, by the same token, insofar as it interiorizes and temporalizes Dasein,\nthe given of sensory-spatial intuition, language lifts existence itself, \"relifts\"\n(rel\u00e8ve) it in its truth, producing thereby a kind of promotion of presence. It\nmakes sensory existence pass into representative or intellectual existence, the\nexistence of the concept. Such a transition is precisely the moment of articulation\nwhich transforms sound into voice and noise into language: \"The vocal note\n[the phonic sound: der Ton] which receives further articulation to express specific\nideas\u2014speech (die Rede), and its system, language (die Sprache)\u2014gives to sen-\nsations, intuitions, conceptions, a second and higher existence than they nat-\nurally possess\u2014invests them with the right of existence in the realm of\nrepresentation (des Vorstellens)\" (ibid.).\nIn the passage which concerns us, Hegel is interested in language \"only in\nthe special aspect of a product of intelligence for manifesting its ideas in an\nexternal medium.\" He does not undertake the study of language itself, if it can\nbe put thus. He has defined the order of general semiology, its place in psy-\nchology, and then the site of linguistics within a semiology whose teleological\nmodel is linguistics nevertheless. The Enci,sclopedia goes no further than system-\natics or architectonics. It does not fill the field whose limits and topography it\nmarks. However the lineaments of a linguistics are indicated. For example, this\nlinguistics wifi have to submit to the distinction between the formal (grammatical)\nelement and the material (lexicological) element. Such an analysis dissolves the\ndiscourse on linguistics, undoes it between its before and its after.\nLexicology, the science of the material of language, in effect refers us to a\ndiscipline already treated before psychology: anthropology.

It is within this teleology that the decisive concept of phi,'sical ideality is\nto be understood. Ideality in general, in Hegelian terms, is \"the negation of the\nreal, but a negation where the real is put past, virtually retained (virfualiter\nerhalten), although it does not exist\" (sec. 403, p. 92). Since the sign is the\nnegativity which \"relifts\" (rel\u00e8ve) sensory intuition into the ideality of language,\nit must be hewn from a sensory matter which in some way is given to it, offering\na predisposed nonresistance to the work of idealization.'8 The idealizing and\n18. \"The spirit must first withdraw into itself from nature, lift itself above it, and over-\ncome it, before it can prevail in it without hindrance as in an element which cannot\nwithstand it (widerstnndslos), and transform it into a positive existence (Dasein) of its Own\nfreedom\"\nI, p. 443).\n90\n"

H, p. 808).\nCorrelatively, sight is an ideal sense, more ideal, by definition and as its name\nindicates, than touch or taste. One can also say that sight gives its sense to theory.\nIt suspends desire, lets things be, reserves or forbids their consummation.2\u00b0 The\nvisible has in common with the sign, Hegel tells us, that it cannot be eaten.\nHowever, if sight is ideal, hearing is even more so. It \"relifts\" (rel\u00e8ve) sight.\nDespite the ideality of light and vision, the objects perceived by the eye, for\nexample plastic works of art, persist beyond the perception of their sensory,\nexterior, stubborn existence; they resist the Aufhebung, and in and of themselves\ncannot be absolutely relev\u00e9 by temporal interiority. They hold back the work of\ndialectics. This being the case for plastic works of art, it certainly will be so for\nwriting as such. But not for music and speech. Hearing is the most sublime\nsense: \"Hearing. . . like sight, is one of the theoretical and not practical senses,\nand it is still more ideal than sight. For the peaceful and undesiring (begierdlose)\ncontemplation of works of art lets them remain in peace and independently as\nthey are, and there is no wish to consume or destroy them; yet what it appre-\nhends is not something inherently posited ideally, but on the contrary something\npersisting in its visible existence. The ear, on the contrary, without itself turning\nto a practical (praktisch) relation to objects, listens to the result of the inner\nvibration (inneren Erzif ferns) of the body through which what comes before us\nis no longer the peaceful and material shape, but the first and more ideal breath\nof the soul (Seelenhaftigkeit). Further, since the negativity into which the vibrating\nmaterial (schwingende Material) enters here is on one side the rel\u00e8ve (Aufheben) of\nthe spatial situation, a rel\u00e8ve relev\u00e9 again by the reaction of the body, therefore\nthe expression of this double negation, i.e. sound (Ton), is an externality which\nin its coming-to-be is annihilated again by its very existence, and it vanishes\nof itself. Owing to this double negation of externality, implicit in the principle\nof sound, inner subjectivity corresponds to it because the resounding (Klingen),\n20. The Hegelian theory of desire is the theory of the contradiction between theory and\ndesire. Theory is the death of desire, death in desire, if not the desire of death. The entire\nintroduction to the Aesthetics demonstrates this contradiction between desire (Begierde),\nwhich pushes toward consummation, and \"theoretical interest,\" which lets things be in\ntheir freedom. In the extent to which art \"is situated between pure sensuousness and pure\nthought,\" and to which \"in art the sensuous is spiritualized (vergeistigt)\" and the spirit\n\"sensualized (versinnlichf),\" art itself in a privileged way is addressed \"to the two theoretical\nsenses of sight and hearing\" (Aesth. II, p. 622). Touch is concerned only with the resistance\nof sensuous and material individuality as such; taste dissociates and consumes the object;\nwhile smell lets it evaporate. \"Sight, on the other hand, has a purely theoretical relation\nto objects (Gegenstanden) by means of light, this as it were nonmaterial matter. This for its\npart lets objects persist freely and independently; it makes them shine and appear (scheinen\nend erschejnen) but, unlike air and fire, it does not consume them in practice whether\nunnoticeably or openly. To vision, void of desire (begierdelose Sehen), everything is presented\nwhich exists materially in space as something outside everything else (Aussereinander), but\nwhich, because it remains undisturbed in its integrity, is manifest only in its shape and\ncolor\" (ibid.).\n92\n"

In the Philosophy of Nature it is at the center of the physics\nof sound (Klang); and there, as always, it marks the passage, through the op-\neration of negativity, of space into time, of the material into the ideal passing\nthrough \"abstract materiality\" (abstrakte\nThis teleological concept\nof sound as the movement of idealization, the Aufhebung of natural exteriority,\nthe rel\u00e8ve of the visible into the audible, is, along with the entire philosophy of\nnature, the fundamental presupposition of the Hegelian interpretation of lan-\n21. Elsewhere: \"The other theoretical sense is hearing. Here the opposite comes into\nview. Instead of shape, colour, etc., hearing has to do with sound (Ton), with the vibration\nof a body; here there is no process of dissolution, like that required by smell; there is\nmerely a trembling (Erzittern) of the object (Gegenstandes) which is left uninjured thereby.\nThis ideal movement in which simple subjectivity, as it were the soul of the body, is\nexpressed by its sound, is apprehended by the ear just as theoretically as the eye appre-\nhends colour or shape; and in this way the inner side of objects is made apprehensible\nby the inner life\" (Aesth. II, p. 622).\nThis hierarchical classification combines two criteria: objectivity and interiority, which\nare only apparently opposed, since idealization has as its meaning (from Plato to Husserl)\nthe simultaneous confirmation of objectivity and interiority one by the other. Ideal objec-\ntivity maintains its identity with itself, its integrity and its resistance all the more in no\nlonger depending upon an empirical sensuous exteriority. Here, the combination of the\ntwo criteria permits the elimination of touch (which is concerned only with a material\nexteriority: masterable objectivity), taste (a consummation which dissolves the object in\nthe interiority), and smell (which permits the object to dissociate itself into evaporation)\nfrom the theoretical domain. Sight is imperfectly theoretical and ideal (it lets the objectivity\nof the object be, but cannot intenorize its sensuous and spatial opaqueness). According\nto a metaphor well coordinated with the entire system of metaphysics, only hearing,\nwhich preserves both objectivity and interiority, can be called fully ideal and theoretical.\nTherefore in its eminence it is designated by optical language (idea, theOria), which permits\nus to go back to the analysis of this metaphorical system. We will attempt this elsewhere.\nHere, let us insert the following passage from the \"Rat Man\" in order to mark, with a\ndotted line, several references and several intentions: \"And here I should like to raise the\ngeneral question whether the atrophy of the sense of smell (which was an inevitable result\nof man's assumption of an erect posture) and the consequent organic repression of his\npleasure in smell may not have had a considerable share in the origin of his susceptibility\nto nervous disease. This would afford us some explanation of why, with the advance of\ncivilization, it is precisely the sexual life that must fall a victim to repression. For we have\nlong known the intimate connection between the sexual instinct and the function of the\nolfactory organ.\" Freud: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works, vol. 10\n(London: Hogarth Press, 1955), p. 248. Hegel again: \"But the objet d'art should be con-\ntemplated in its independent objectivity on its own account; true, it is there for our\napprehension but only in a theoretical and intellectual way, not in a practical one, and it\nhas no relation to desire or the will. As for smell, it cannot be an organ of artistic enjoyment\neither, because things are only available to smell in so far as they are in process and their\naroma is dissipated through the air and its practical influence\" (Aesth. H, p. 622).\n22. These propositions are explicated at length in sections 299\u2014302 of the Encyclopedia\n(\"Philosophy of\nsec. 2, Physics). See also the Philosophy of Spirit.

The Teleological Hierarchy of Writings\nAt the peak of this hierarchy is phonetic writing of the alphabetic type: \"Al-\nphabetic writing is on all accounts the more intelligent\" (sec. 459, p. 216). To\nthe extent that it respects, translates, or transcribes the voice, that is, idealization,\nthe movement of the spirit relating itself to its own interiority and hearing itself\n/\nspeak, phonetic writing is the most historic element of culture, the element most\nopen to the infinite development of tradition. At least in the principle of its\nfunctioning: \"What has been said shows the inestimable and not sufficiently\nappreciated educational value of learning to read and write an alphabetic char-\nacter. It leads the mind from the sensibly concrete image to attend to the more\nformal structure of the vocal word and its abstract elements, and contributes\nmuch to give stability and independence to the inward realm of mental life\"\n(sec. 459, p. 218).\nHistory\u2014which according to Hegel is always the history of the spirit\u2014the\ndevelopment of the concept as logos, and the ontotheological unfolding of par-\nousia, etc. are not obstructed by alphabetic writing. On the contrary, since it\nerases its own spacing better than any other, alphabetic writing remains the\nhighest and more relevant\nSuch a teleological appreciation of alpha-\nbetic writing constitutes a system and structurally governs the following two\nconsequences:\na. Beyond the fact of alphabetical writing, Hegel here is calling upon a teleo-\nlogical ideal. In effect, as Hegel recognizes, in passing, certainly, but quite clearly,\nthere is not and there cannot be a purely phonetic writing. The alphabetic\nsystem, such as we practice it, is not and cannot be purely phonetic. Writing\ncan never be totally inhabited by the voice. The nonphonetic functions, if you\nwifi, the operative silences of alphabetic writing, are not factual accidents or\nin transforming names into images, and thus again deposing memory to the level of\nimagination. The place of the power of memory is taken by a permanent tableau (Tableau)\nof a series of images, fixed in the imagination, to which is then attached the series of ideas\nforming the composition to be learned by rote (auswendig). Considering the heterogeneity\nbetween the import of these ideas and those permanent images, and the speed with which\nthe attachment has to be made, the attachment cannot be made otherwise than by shallow,\nsilly, and utterly accidental links\" (Enc., sec. 462, p. 220). This exterionty of the \"by rote\"\nis confronted by living, spiritual memory, in which everything proceeds from the inside.\nAll these developments are governed by the opposition Auswendig/lnwendig and by that\nof Entausserung and Erinnerung in the name. See also the important sections 463\u201464.

Under the heading of \"Unconscious Symbolism\" Hegel writes: \"Simi-\nlarly the hieroglyphic script of the Egyptians is also largely symbolic, since either\nit tries to make us acquainted with the meanings by sketching actu?l objects\nwhich display (darstellen) not themselves, but a universal related to them, or,\nmore commonly still, in its so-called phonetic element this script indicates the\nindividual letters by illustrating an object the initial letter of which has in speech\nthe same sound as that which is to be expressed\" (Aesth. I, p. 357). Next, invoking\nthe example of the colossi, which according to legend emitted sounds under the\ninfluence of the dew and the first rays of the sun, Hegel believes he can see in\nthem that spirit is only beginning to liberate itself and to recognize itself as such:\n\"But taken as symbols, the meaning to be ascribed to these colossi is that they\ndo not have the spiritual soul freely in themselves and therefore, instead of\nbeing able to draw animation (Belebung) from within, from what bears proportion\nand beauty in itself, they require for it light from without which alone liberates\nthe note of the soul from them. The human voice, on the other hand, resounds\nout of one's own feeling and one's own spirit without any external impulse, just\nas the height of art in general consists in making the inner give shape to itself\nout of its own being. But the inner life of the human form is still dumb (stumrn)\nin Egypt and in its animation (Beseelung) it is only a natural factor that is kept\nin view\" (Aesth. I, p. 358).27\nThe naturalness of the hieroglyphic symbol is the condition for its polysemia.\nFor a polysemia which in Hegel's view does not have the merit of the regulated\nambivalence of certainly naturally speculative words of the German language.\nHere, the obscure instability of meaning has to do with spirit's not having clearly\n26.

The \"symbols of general significations\" are there mani-\nfested by \"writings\" and by \"graven images.\" The forms and figures of the temple therefore\nreplace books, supplement them (die Stelle dL'r Bucher vertreten). \"Here and there Memnons\nlean against the sloping walls which also form galleries and are bedecked all over with\nhieroglyphics or enormous pictures in stone so that they appeared to the French scholars\nwho saw them recently as if they were printed in calico.

Certainly nature has begun to animate itself, and\nitself to relate to itself, itself to examine itself, is in motion enough to signal and\nto symbolize with itself. But spirit does not come back to itself in this, does not\nyet recognize itself. The materiality of the signifier, it could be said, functions\nby itself as \"unconscious symbolism.\" \"Now owing to this alternating symbolism\n(Wechselsymbolik), the symbol in Egypt is at the same time an ensemble of sym-\nbols, so that what at one time appears as meaning (Bedeutung) is also used again\nas a symbol of a related sphere. In a symbolism which confusedly intertwines\n(durcheinarz4erschlingt) meaning and shape, presages a variety of things in fact\nor alludes to them, and therefore already comes close to that inner subjectivity\nwhich alone can develop itself in many directions, the associations are ambig-\nuous (vieldeutig) and this is the virtue of these productions, although their ex-\nplanation is of course made difficult owing to this ambiguity\" (Aesth. I, p. 360).\nThis polysemia is so essential, belongs so necessarily to the structure of the\nhieroglyph, that the difficulty of deciphering has nothing to do with our situation\nor lack of contemporaneity. Hegel specifies, rather, that it had to limit the reading\nof the Egyptians themselves. Hence the transition from Egypt to Greece is the\ndeciphering and deconstitution of the hieroglyph, of the hieroglyph's properly\nsymbolic structure such as it itself is symbolized in the figure of the Sphinx.\nGreece is the answer of Oedipus, which Hegel interprets as the discourse and\noperation of consciousness itself. \"The works of Egyptian art in their mysterious\nsymbolism are therefore riddles; the objective riddle par excellence. As a symbol\nfor this proper meaning of the Egyptian spirit we may mention the Sphinx. It\nis, as it were, the symbol of the symbolic itself.\n.\n. It is in this sense that the\nSphinx in the Greek myth, which we ourselves may interpret again symbolically,\nappears as a monster asking a riddle\" (Aesth. I, p. 360). With his answer, Oedipus\ndestroys the Sphinx. \"The Sphinx propounded the well-known conundrum:\nWhat is it that in the morning goes on four legs, at mid-day on two, and in the\nevening on three? Oedipus found the simple answer: a man, and he tumbled\nthe Sphinx from the rock. The explanation of the symbol lies in the absolute\nmeaning, in the spirit, just as the famous Greek inscription calls to man: Know\nthyself. The light of consciousness is the clarity which makes its concrete content\nshine clearly through the shape belonging and appropriate to itself, and its\nexistence reveals itself alone\" (Aesth. I, p. 361).\nWith the answer to the riddle, Oedipus's words, the discourse of conscious-\nness, man destroys, dissipates, or tumbles the petroglyph. And corresponding\nto the stature of the Sphinx, the animality of spirit asleep in the stony sign, the\nmediation between matter and man, the duplicity of the intermediary, is the\nfigure of Thoth, the god of writing. The place Hegel assigns to this demigod\n(a secondary god, inferior to the god of thought, the animal servant of the great\ngod, man's animal, god's man, etc.) in no way upsets the staging of the Phae-\n99\n"

A progress in formalizing abstraction, a detachment as concerns\nthe sensuous and the natural symbol. But this progress, which corresponds to\nthe moment of abstract understanding, never recovers what it loses: the spec-\nulative concreteness of Western speech finds then that the process of idealization\nhas even \"relifted\" (relev\u00e9) its sensuous extenority. Whence the analogy between\nthe structure of Chinese writing and the structures of Jormal understanding in\nWestern philosophy circumscribed by Hegel, in particular a certain authority of\nthe mathematical model over philosophy: \"It must certainly be considered that\npure thoughts are brought to consciousness, but in this case we make no ad-\nvance, merely remaining stationary so far as they are concerned. The concrete\nis not conceived of speculatively, but is simply taken from ordinary ideas, in-\nasmuch as it is expressed in accordance with their forms of representation and\nof perception\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 121\u201422).\nFollowing the classical framework of the Hegelian critique, Chinese culture\nand writing are reproached simultaneously for their empiricism (naturalism,\nhistoricism) and their formalism (mathematizing abstraction).3'\nA typical movement of the Hegelian text: speculative dialectics sets on its\ncourse a sometimes quite precise piece of historical information, but without\nprecautions. A certain number of very determined effects result from this,\nand in the very form of that which Hegel elsewhere criticizes: the juxtaposition\nof an empirical content with a henceforth abstract form, an exterior form su-\nperimposed on that which it should organize. This is manifest particularly in\nunnoticed contradictions, contradictions without concepts and not reducible to\nthe speculative movement of contradiction.\nThe propositions concerning Chinese writing and grammar are a symptomatic\nexample of this. In this sense, Chinese grammar is insufficiently developed,\nwhich Hegel does not add to its credit. Compared to Western grammars, Chinese\nsyntax is in a state of stagnant primitiveness, paralyzing the movement of sci-\nence. Hegel, then, contradicts himself twice, though there is no dialectical ne-\ngation of negation; it is rather a denegation, a disavowal. In effect, above we\nnoticed the following two motifs: (1) the development and differentiation of\nor figures (1-lo-tu) which he saw on the back of a horse-dragon as it rose out of the river.\n(Other figures ILo-Choui were borrowed from the back of a tortoise and combined with\nthe signs of Fo-Hi.) This table contains parallel lines above one another, which have a\nsymbolical signification; and the Chinese say that these lines are the foundation of their\ncharacters as also of their philosophy\" (History of Philosophy, p. 121; translation modified).\n31. \"The Chinese have remained with the abstract, and when they arrive at the concrete\none finds, on the theoretical side, an exterior connection of objects of the sensory kind;\none finds no order, no profound intuition, and the rest is morals. The concrete in which\nthe beginning is pursued consists of morals, of the art of government, of history, etc., but\nthis concrete is not of a philosophical order. In China, in Chinese religion and philosophy,\nwe encounter a particularly perfect prose of understanding\" (Gibelin, pp. 252\u201453).\n102\n"

Let us read the text.\n\"For if we consider in the first place, the effect of such a mode of writing on\nthe Spoken Language, we shall find this among the Chinese very imperfect, on\naccount of that separation. For our Spoken Language is matured to distinctness\nchiefly through the necessity of finding signs for each single sound, which latter,\nby reading, we learn to express distinctly. The Chinese, to whom such a means\nof orthoepic development is wanting, do not mature the modifications of sounds\nin their language to distinct articulations capable of being represented by letters\nand syllables. Their Spoken Language consists of an inconsiderable number of\nmonosyllabic words, which are used with more than one signification. The sole\nmethods of denoting distinctions of meaning are the connection, the accent, and\nthe pronunciation\u2014quicker or slower, softer or louder. The ears of the Chinese\nhave become very sensible to such distinctions. Thus I find that the word Po\nhas eleven different meanings according to the tone: denoting 'glass'\u2014'to boil'\u2014\n'to winnow wheat'\u2014'to cleave asunder'\u2014'to water'\u2014'to prepare'\u2014'an old\nwoman'\u2014'a\nliberal man'\u2014'a wise person'\u2014'a little'\" (Philosophy of\nHistory, p. 135).M The discourse of the Chinese, then, entangles itself in the\ndissemination of meanings and accents. Their writing, no longer reflecting or\nreassembling living language, paralyzes itself far from the concept, in the cold\nspace of formal abstraction, that is in space. In sum, Hegel reproaches the Chinese\nfor speaking too much when they speak, and for writing too much when they\nwrite.\nSuch a procedure is at least consequent with the system which links the logos\nto alphabetical writing, as soon as alphabetical writing is taken as an absolute\nmodel. Speculative dialectics permits itself to be separated neither from logos\nnor, simultaneously, from the logos which never thinks or presents itself except\nin its historical complicity with the voice and phonetic writing. The grammar\nof the logos thus being confused with the system of metaphysics, Hegel may\nwrite, in the course of a long elaboration on the Tao To King: \"According to Abel\nR\u00e9musat, Tao means to the Chinese 'Way, means of communication from one\nplace to another,' and then reason, substance, principle. All of this condensed\nto the metaphorical, metaphysical sense signifies way in general. . . Tao, thus,\nis the 'original reason, the nous (intelligence) which has brought forth the world\nand governs it as spirit governs the body.' Abel R\u00e9musat says that taken at its\nbest this might be expressed by the Greek in logos. However, this remains quite\nconfused. The Chinese language, due to its grammatical structure, creates many\ndifficulties; notably, these objects are difficult to exhibit because of their inher-\nently abstract and undetermined nature. Von Humboldt recently showed, in a\nletter to Abel Remusat, how undetermined the grammatical construction was\n(C. von Humboldt, Letter to M. Abel Remusat On the Nature of the Grammatical\n34. The same argument can be found in sec. 459 of the Encyclopedia.\n104\n"

Even if one does not wish\nto summarize Sartre's thought under the slogan \"existentialism is a humanism,\"\nit must be recognized that in Being and Nothingness, The Sketch of a Theory of the\nEmotions, etc., the major concept, the theme of the last analysis, the irreducible\nhorizon and origin is what was then called \"human-reality.\" As is well known,\nthis is a translation of Heideggerian Dasein. A monstrous translation in many\nrespects, but so much the more significant. That this translation proposed by\nCorbin was adopted at the time, and that by means of Sartre's authority it\nreigned, gives us much to think about the reading or the nonreading of Hei-\ndegger during this period, and about what was at stake in reading or not reading\nhim in this way.\nCertainly the notion of \"human-reality\" translated the project of thinking the\nmeaning of man, the humanity of man, on a new basis, if you will. If the neutral\nand undetermined notion of \"human reality\" was substituted for the notion of\nman, with all its metaphysical heritage and the substantialist motif or temptation\ninscribed in it, it was also in order to suspend all the presuppositions which had\nalways constituted the concept of the unity of man. Thus, it was also a reaction\nagainst a certain intellectualist or spiritualist humanism which had dominated\nFrench philosophy (Brunschvig, Alain, Bergson, etc.). And this neutralization\nof every metaphysical or speculative thesis as concerns the unity of the anthropos\ncould be considered in some respects as the faithful inheritance of Husserl's\ntranscendental phenomenology and of the fundamental ontology in Sein und\nZeit (the only partially known work of Heidegger's at the time, along with What\nIs Metaphysics? and Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics). And yet, despite this\nalleged neutralization of metaphysical presuppositions,4 it must be recognized\nthat the unity of man is never examined in and of itself. Not only is existentialism\na humanism, but the ground and horizon of what Sartre then called his \"phe-\nnomenological ontology\" (the subtitle of Being and Nothingness) remains the unity\nof human-reality. To the extent that it describes the structures of human-reality,\n4. The humanism which marks Sartre's philosophical discourse in its depths. however,\nis very surely and very ironically taken apart in Nausea: in the caricature of the Autodidact,\nfor example, the same figure reassembles the theological project of absolute knowledge\nand the humanist ethic, in the form of the encyclopedic epistemophilia which leads the\nAutodidact to undertake the reading of the world library (which is really the Western\nlibrary, and definitely the municipal library) in alphabetical order by author's name, and\nin areas where he is able to love Man (\"There is an aim, sir, there is an aim. . . there are\nmen. . . one must love them, one must love them\") in the representation of men, pref-\nerably young men. It is in the dialogue with the Autodidact that Roquentin levels the\nworst charges against humanism, against all humanist styles; and at the moment when\nnausea is slowly rising in him, he says to himself, for example, \"I don't want to be\nintegrated, I don't want my good red blood to go and fatten this lymphatic beast: I will\nnot be fool enough to call myself 'anti-humanist.'

The Hegelian concepts of truth, negativity, and Aufhebung, with all their\nresults, prevent this from being so. In the third part of the Encyclopedia which\ntreats the \"Philosophy of Spirit,\" the first section (\"Philosophy of Spirit\") in-\nscribes the Phenomenology of Spirit between the \"Anthropology\" and the \"Psy-\nchology.\" The Phenomenology of Spirit succeeds the Anthropology and precedes\nthe Psychology. The Anthropology treats the spirit\u2014which is the \"truth of na-\nture\"\u2014as soul or as natural-spirit (Seele or Nat urgeist). The development of the\nsoul, such as it is retraced by the anthropology, passes through the natural soul\n(naturliche Seele), through the sensible soul (fuhlende Seele), and through the real\nor effective soul (wirkliche Seele). This development accomplishes and completes\nitself, and then opens onto consciousness. The last section of the Anthropology'2\ndefines the general form of consciousness, the very one from which the Phen-\nomenology of Spirit will depart, in the first chapter on \"Sensuous Certitude.\"3\nConsciousness, i.e. the phenomenological, therefore, is the truth of the soul,\nthat is, precisely the truth of that which was the object of the anthropology.\nConsciousness is the truth of man, phenomenology is the truth of anthropology.\n\"Truth,\" here, must be understood in a rigorously Hegelian sense. In this He-\ngelian sense, the metaphysical essence of truth, the truth of the truth, is\nachieved. Truth is here the presence or presentation of essence as Gewesenheit,\nof Wesen as having-been. Consciousness is the truth of man to the extent that\n11.

What is difficult to think today is an end of man which would not be\norganized by a dialectics of truth and negativity, an end of man which would\nnot be a teleology in the first person plural. The we, which articulates natural\nand philosophical consciousness with each other in the Phenomenology of Spirit,\nassures the proximity to itself of the fixed and central being for which this circular\nreappropriation is produced. The we is the unity of absolute knowledge and\nanthropology, of God and man, of onto-theo-teleology and humanism. \"Being\"\nand Language\u2014the group of languages\u2014that the we governs or opens: such is\nthe name of that which assures the transition between metaphysics and hu-\nmanism via the we)5\n14.

      "full_text": "The Ends of Man\nWe have just perceived the necessity which links the thinking of the phainestlzai\nto the thinking of the telos. The teleology which governs Husserl's transcendental\nphenomenology can be read in the same opening. Despite the critique of an-\nthropologism, \"humanity,\" here, is still the name of the being to which the\ntranscendental telos\u2014determined as Idea (in the Kantian sense) or even as Rea-\nson\u2014is announced. It is man as animal rationale who, in his most classical me-\ntaphysical determination, designates the site of teleological reason's unfolding,\nthat is, history. For Husserl as for Hegel, reason is history, and there is no history\nbut of reason. The latter \"functions in every man, the animal rationale, no matter\nhow primitive he is. . .\" Every kind of humanity and human sociality has \"a\noccult qualities (which might be called hypophysical), is not only an indispensable substrate\nof all theoretically sound and definite knowledge of duties; it is also a desideratum of the\nhighest importance to the actual fulfilment of its precepts\" (\"Foundations of the Meta;\nphysics of Morals,\" in The Crit ique of Practical Reason\n.\n. , p. 70). \"Furthermore, it is evident\nthat it is not only of the greatest necessity in a theoretical point of view when it is a\nquestion of speculation but also of the utmost practical importance to derive the concepts\nand laws of morals from pure reason and to present them pure and unmixed, and to\ndetermine the scope of this entire practical but pure rational knowledge (the entire faculty\nof pure practical reason) without making the principles depend upon the particular nature\nof human reason, as speculative philosophy may permit and even sometimes find nec-\nessary. But since moral laws should hold for every rational being as such, the principles\nmust be derived from the universal concept of a rational being generally. In this manner\nall morals, which need anthropology for their application to men, must be completely\ndeveloped first as pure philosophy, i.e. metaphysics, independently of anthropology\"\n(ibid., p. 71). \"With a view to attaining this, it is extremely important to remember that\nwe must not let ourselves think that the reality of this principle can be derived from the\nparticular constitution of human nature 'aus der besondern Eigenschaft der menschlichen Nat ur).\nFor duty is practical unconditional necessity of action; it must, therefore, hold for all\nrational beings (to which alone an imperative can apply), and only for that reason can it be\na law for all human wills\" (ibid., p. 83). We see in these three passages that what is always\nof the \"greatest importance\" (von der hochsten Wichtigkeit ... von der grossten praktischen\nWichtigkeit .\n. . von der \u00e4ussersten Wichtigkeif) is to determine the end in itself (as an un-\nconditioned principle of morality), independently of any anthropological givens. One\ncannot think the purity of the end of the basis of man.\nB. But, on the other hand, and inversely, man's specificity, man's essence as a rational\nbeing, as the rational animal (zOoii logon ekhon), announces itself to itself only on the basis\nof thinking the end in itself; it announces itself to itself as the end in itself; that is, equally,\nas an infinite end, since the thinking of the unconditioned is also the thinking which raises\nitself above experience, that is, above finitude. Thus is explained the fact that despite the\ncritique of anthropologism, of which we have just given a few indices, man is the only\nexample, the only case of a rational being that can ever be cited at the very moment when\nby all rights one distinguishes the universal concept of a rational being from the concept\nof the human being. It is through the offices of this fact that anthropology regains all its\ncontested authority. This is the point at which the philosopher says \"we,\" and at which\nin Kant's discourse \"rational being\" and \"humanity\" are always associated by the con-\njunction \"and\" or vel. For example \"Now, I say, man and in general (und uberhaupt) every\nrational being, exists as an end in himself, and not merely as a means\" (Foundations .\np. 86). [Note that this phrase is from the passage that serves as the first epigraph to this\ntext. The deconstruction of the end and of man takes place on the margins of philosophy:\nin titles and footnotes.] \"This principle of humanity and of every rational creature as an\nend in itself\" (ibid., pp. 88-89).\n122\n"

And,\namong these metaphysical concepts which form the essential resource of Hus-\nsen's discourse, the concept of end or of telos plays a decisive role. It could be\nshown that at each stage of phenomenology, and notably each time that a\nrecourse to the \"Idea in the Kantian sense\" is necessary, the infinity of the telos,\nthe infinity of the end regulates phenomenology's capabilities. The end of man\n(as a factual anthropological limit) is announced to thought from the vantage\nof the end of man (as a determined opening or the infinity of a telos).

We\nwho are close to ourselves, we interrogate ourselves about the meaning of Being.\nLet us read this protocol of reading: \"If the question about Being is to be explicitly\nformulated and carried through in such a manner as to be completely transparent\nto itself, then any treatment of it in line with the elucidations we have given\nrequires us to explain how Being is to be looked at, how its meaning is to be\nunderstood and conceptually grasped; it requires us to prepare the way for\nchoosing the right entity for our example, and to work out the genuine way of\naccess to it. Looking at something, understanding and conceiving it, choosing\naccess to it\u2014all these ways of behaving are constitutive of our inquiry, and\ntherefore are modes of Being for those particular entities which we, the inquirers,\nare ourselves (eines\nSeienden, des Seienden, das wir, die Fragenden, je\nselbst sind). Thus to work out the question of Being adequately, we must make\nan entity\u2014the inquirer\u2014transparent in his own Being.

This style of a reading which makes explicit, practices\na continual bringing to light, something which resembles, at least, a coming into\nconsciousness, without break, displacement, or change of terrain.

It is,. as we shall see,\na repetition of\nessence of manp\nreturn to what is before the\nconcepts ofh\nsubtlety and equivocality of this gesture,\nthen, are what appear to have authorized all the anthropologistic deformations\nin the reading of Sein und Zeit, notably in France.\nThe value of proximity, that is, of presence in general, therefore decides the\nessential orientation of this analytic of Dasein. The motif of proximity surely\nfinds itself caught in an opposition which henceforth will unceasingly regulate\nHeidegger's discourse. The fifth section of Sein und Zeit in effect seems not to\ncontradict but to limit and contain what was already gained, to wit that the\nDasein \"which we are\" constitutes the exemplary being for the hermeneutic of\nthe meaning of Being by virtue of its proximity to itself, of our proximity to\nourselves, our proximity to the being that we are. At this point Heidegger marks\nthat this proximity is ontic. Ontologically, that is, as concerns the Being of that\nbeing which we are, the distance, on the contrary, is as great as possible. \"On-\ntically, of course, Dasein is not only close to us\u2014even that which is closest: we\nare it, each of us, we ourselves.

The Da of\nDasein and the Da of Sein will signify as much the near as the far. Beyond the\ncommon closure of humanism and metaphysics, Heidegger's thought will be\n21. \"In demonstrating that Dasein is ontico-ontologically prior, we may have misled the\nreader into supposing that this entity must also be what is given as ontico-ontologically\nprimary (primar), not only in the sense that it can itself be grasped 'immediately,' but also\nin that the kind of Being which it possesses is presented just as 'immediately.'

But then the essence of man\nis too little (zu gering) heeded and not thought in its origin, the essential provenance that\nis always the essential future for historical mankind (geschichtliche Menschentum). Meta-\nphysics thinks of man on the basis of aninwlitas and does not think in the direction of his\nhumanitas.\n\"Metaphysics doses itself to the simple essential fact that man essentially occurs only\nin his essence (in seinem Wesen west) where he is daimed (angesprochen) by Being. Only\nfrom that daim 'has' he found that wherein his essence dwells. Only from this dwelling\n'has' he 'language' as the home that preserves the ecstatic for his essence. Such standing\nin the lighting of Being (Lichtung des Seins) I call the ek-sistence of man. This way of Being\nis proper (eignet) only to man. Ek-sistence so understood is not only the ground of the\npossibility of reason, ratio, but is also that in which the essence of man preserves (wahrf)\nthe source that determines him.\n\"Ek-sistence can be said only of the essence of man, that is, only of the human 'to be.'\nFor as far as our experience shows, only man is admitted to the destiny of ek-sistence (in\ndin Geschick der Eksistence).\" \"Letter,\" pp. 203\u20144.\nThe motif of the proper (eigen, eigentlich) and the several modes of to propriate (particularly\nEreignen and Ereignis), both of which thematically dominate the question of the truth of\nBeing in Zeit und Sein, has long been at work in Heidegger's thought. In the \"Letter on\nHumanism\" in particular. The themes of the house and of the proper are regularly brought\ntogether: as we will attempt to show later, the value of oikos (and of oik\u00ebsis) plays a decisive,\nif hidden, role in the semantic chain that interests us here.

The Latin medium of this transition (prope, proprius) is lost in other\nlanguages, for example in German.\n36. On the topic of what unites the values of self-presence and spoken language, I\npermit myself to refer toOf Granimatology and Speech and Phenomena.

Having reached a certain point in the analysis, it is necessary\nto measure the extent of this valorization rigorously: if it covers almost the entirety of\nHeidegger's text (in that it leads all the metaphysical determinations of the present or of\nbeing back to the matrix of Being as presence, Anwesenheit), it is also erased at the point\nat which is announced the question of a Wesen that would not even be an Anwesen. (On\nthis subject, see \"Ousia and Gramme,\" above.) Thus is explained, for example, the dis-\nqualification of literature, which is opposed to thinking and to Dichtung, and also to an\nartisan- and \"peasant\"-like practice of the letter: \"In written form thinking easily loses its\nflexibility.\n. .

Theological\ncertitude is accommodated to a natural explanation according to a very classical\nframework in which the concepts of nature, experience, creation, and fall are\nstrictly inseparable. (The most remarkable example of such a \"system\" is doubt-\nless that of Malebranche, which I am recalling here only because of its well-\nknown influence on Rousseau.) Here, the event of the flood, whose analog will\nbe found in Rousseau, liberates the functioning of the natural explanation.\nThis does not prevent Rousseau from taking his leave from Condillac precisely\nat the point at which he reproaches Condillac for taking as given that which is\nto be explained, that is, \"a kind of already established society among the in-\nventors of language.\" Rousseau reproaches Condillac less for rejecting every\nmodel of natural explanation\u2014that would be untrue\u2014than for not radicalizing\nhis concept of nature: Condillac would not have descended to a pure state of\nnature to analyze the emergence of language: \"Permit me for a moment to\nconsider all the confusions of the origin of Languages. I could content myself\nwith citing or repeating here all of Abb\u00e9 de Condillac's investigations into this\nmatter, which fully confirm my feeling, and which, perhaps, gave me my first\nideas.

Now, without even entering into the content of the natural\ngenealogy of language that Rousseau proposes, let us note that the so-called\n\"epistemological break\" paradoxically corresponds to a kind of break in the field\nof natural causality. If \"speech,\" \"the first social institution, owes its form to\nnatural causes alone,\"8 then the latter, themselves acting as a force of break with\nnature, naturally inaugurate an order radically heterogeneous to the natural order.\nThe two\u2014apparently contradictory\u2014conditions for the constitution of a scientific\nfield and object, here language, would thus be fulfilled: a natural, a continuously\nnatural causality, and a break designating the irreducible autonomy and origi-\nnality of a domain. The question of the origin is in itself suspended, in that it\nno longer calls for a continuous, real, and natural description, being but the\nindex of an internal structural description.\nCertainly all this is neither without difficulty nor without a certain apparent\nincoherence, for which Rousseau often has been reproached. And it has been\nthat much easier to make this reproach because Rousseau himself on several\noccasions seems to renounce the natural explanation and to admit a kind of\nviolent\u2014catastrophic\u2014interruption into the concatenation of natural causality.\nAn arbitrary interruption, an interruption of the arbitrary, the decision which\npermits only the arbitrary and the conventional to be instituted. One comes\nback to the necessity of this question wherever the conceptuality organized\naround the opposition nature/arbitrary is accredited. Before defining the neces-\nsity both of the break and the at least apparent failure, before underlining the\nscientific and heuristic motivation that accommodates its opposite here, let us\nbriefly recall its well known points of apparition.\n1. After attempting, by means of a fiction, a derivation of languages on the\nbasis of a primitive dispersion in the state of pure nature, on the basis of the\nbiological nucleus uniting mother and child, Rousseau has to step back and\nsuppose \"this first difficulty overcome\": \"Notice again that the Child having all\nhis needs to explain, and consequently more things to say to the Mother than\nthe Mother to the Child, it is he who must bear the burden of invention, and\nthat the language he employs must in great part be his own handiwork; which\n8. Attention must be paid to the word \"form\": natural causes must produce the variety\nof forms of speech as the variety of languages. The Essay accounts for this by means of\nphysics, geography, and cliniatology. This distinction between speech itself and languages\nunderlies the notion of form at the beginning of the Essay: \"Speech distinguishes man\namong the animals; language distinguishes nations from each other; one does not know\nwhere a man comes from until he has spoken. Out of usage and necessity, each learns\nthe language of his own country. But what determines that this language is that of his\ncountry and not that of another? In order to tell, it is necessary to go back to some principle\nthat belongs to the locality itself and antedates its customs, for speech, being the first\nsocial instituiton, owes its form to natural causes alone\" (p. 5). But the text that follows\nperhaps permits an extension of the variety of forms beyond the diversity of oral languages\nto include the multiplicity of \"substances of expressions,\" the means of communication.\nThese natural means are the senses, and each sense has its language. See below, \"The\nClosure of Concepts.\"\n143\n"

But these\napparent, and apparently avowed, confusions have a reverse side for which in\na way they pay the price. The circle, as a vicious circle, a logical circle, by the\nsame token constitutes the rigorously limited, closed, and original autonomy of\na field. If there is no entry into the circle, if it is closed, if one is always already\nset down within it, if it has always already begun to carry us along in its\nmovement, no matter where it is entered, it is because the circle forms a perfectly\nunderivable figure and does so by means of a continuous causality, something\nother than itself. It has been posited decisively by an absolute, and absolutely\nirruptive, initiative, making it simultaneously open and dosed. Society, lan-\nguage, convention, history, etc., together with all the possibilities that go along\nwith them, form a system, an organized totality which, in its orginality, can be\nthe object of a theory. Beyond its negative and sterilizing effects, beyond the\nquestion which it seems incapable of answering logically, the \"logical circle\"\npositively delimits an epistemological cirde, a field whose objects will be specific.\nThe condition for the study of this field as such is that the genetic and factual\nderivation be interrupted. Ideal genealogy or structural description: such is Rous-\nseau's project. Let us cite this text once more: \"Let us begin by setting aside all\nthe facts, for they do not touch upon the question. The Investigations one may\nenter into on this subject must not be taken as historical truths, but only as\nhypothetical and conditional reasoning; more apt to enlighten the Nature of\nthings than to show their veritable origin, and similar to the Investigations made\nevery day by our Physicians concerning the formation of the World.\"2\n3. This is what accounts for the absolutely unforeseeeable intervention, in the\nEssay, of the \"slight movement\" of a finger which produces the birth of society\nand languages. Since the system of the state of Nature could not depart from\nitself, could not itself depart from itself (Discourse, p. 162), could not spontaneously\ninterrupt itself, some perfectly exterior causality had to come to provoke\u2014ar-\nbitrarily\u2014this departure, which is none other, precisely, than the possibility of the\ntaste that I had for him [M. Salomon] extended to the subjects of which he treated, and\nI began to seek out books which could help me better to understand him. Those which\nmixed devoutness with the sciences suited me best; such, particularly, were those of the\nOratoire and of Port-Royal. I set myself to reading them, or rather to devouring them. Of\nthese, one fell into my hands by Father Lamy, entitiled Enfretiens sur les sciences. It was a\nkind of introduction to the knowledge of the books on this topic. I read and reread it a\nhundred times; I resolved to make it my guide\" (p. 232). One might pick out more than\none correspondence between the two theories of language, notably as concerns the re-\nlations between speech and writing. In Father Lamy's Rhetoric one may read: \"Words on\npaper are like a dead body laid out on the ground. In the mouth of whoever proffers them\nthey are efficacious; on paper they are without life, incapable of producing the same\neffects.\" And \"a written discourse is dead,\" \"the tone, gestures, and air of the face of the\nspeaker support his words\" (cited by Rodin-Lewis, p. 27).\n12.

In doing so, even while respecting the original order\nof language and society, he correlates this order, and systematically maintains\nthis correlation, with the order of nature, primarily witi. the geological or geo-\ngraphical order of his nature. Thereby the typology of languages, in the Essay,\nwill conform to a general topology, and \"local difference\" will be taken into\naccount in the origin of languages (chap. 8). Corresponding to the opposition\nsouth/north is the opposition of languages of passion to languages of need,\nare distinguished by the predominance granted to accentuation in the\none and articulation in the other, to the vowel in one and to the consonant in\nthe other, to metaphor in One and to exactness and correctness in the other. The\nlatter\u2014the languages of the north\u2014lend themselves more easily to writing; the\nformer naturally reject it. Thus we have a\nof correlations.

But, by a strange motion, the more one departs from\nthe origin, the more one tends to come back to what precedes it, to a nature\nwhich has not yet awakened to speech and to everything that is born along with\nspeech. And, between the two polar series, regulated relations of supplemen-\ntarity: the second series is added to the first in order to be substituted for it, but,\nin supplementing a lack in the first series, also to add something new, an addition,\nan accident, an excess that should not have overtaken the first series. In doing this,\nthe second series will hollow out a new lack or will enlarge the original lack,\nwhich will call for a new supplement, etc. The same logic is at work in the\nhistoric and systematic classification of writings: corresponding to the three\nstates of man in society (savage, barbaric, or policed peoples) are three types\nof writings (pictographic, ideographic, phonetic).\nBut, although writing has a\n16.

The depicting of objects\nis appropriate to a savage people; signs of words and of propositions to a barbaric people;\nand the alphabet to civilized (polices) peoples\" (Essay. p. 17). \"To the preceding division\nthere correspond the three conditions of man considered in relation to society.

The transcendental\ndescription of the fundamental structures of all experience is pursued up to the\nend of the penultimate \"section\" without even touching upon the problem of\nlanguage. The worlds of culture and of science indeed have been evoked, but\neven if the predicates of culture and of science are unthinkable outside a world\nof language, Husserl gave himself the right, for methodological reasons, not to\nconsider the \"layer\" of expression, provisionally putting it between parentheses.\nHusserl can give himself this right only by supposing that expressivity con-\nstitutes an original and rigorously delimited \"stratum\" (Schicht) of experience.\nThe Investigations had proposed an insistent demonsiration that acts of expres-\nsion are original and irreducible; and this remains presupposed in Ideas. Thus,\nat a certain moment of the descriptive itinerary, one may come to consider\nlinguistic expressivity as a circumscribed problem. And at the point at which\nthe problem is approached, one already knows that the \"stratum of logos\" will\nbe included in the most general structure of experience, the structure whose poles\nor correlations have just been described: the parallel opposition of noesis and\nnoema. Thus, it is already a given that however original, the stratum of the\nlogos would have to be organized according to the parallelism of noesis and\nnoema. The problem of \"meaning\" (bedeuten)4 is approached in section 124,\nwhich is entitled \"The Noetic-Noematic Stratum of the 'Logos.' Meaning and\nMeaning Something (Bedeuten und Bedeutung).\" The metaphor of the stratum\n(Schichf) has two implications. On the one hand, meaning is founded on some-\nthing other than itself, and this dependence will be confirmed ceaselessly by\nHusserl's analysis. On the other hand, meaning constitutes a stratum whose\nunity can be rigorously delimited. Now, if the metaphor of the stratum remains\ncredible throughout this section, it will become suspect in the section's final\nlines. This suspicion is not purely rhetorical but, rather, translates a profound\ndisquiet as concerns the descriptive fidelity of discourse. If the metaphor of the\nstratum does not correspond to the structure one seeks to describe, how could\nit have been used for so long? \"For we should not hold too hard by the metaphor\nof stratification (Schichtung); expression is not of the nature of an overlaid varnish\n(ubergelagerter Lack) or covering garment; it is a mental formation (geistige For-\ntnung), which exercises new intentional influences (Funktionen) on the intentional\nsubstratum (an der intentionalen Untershicht) and experiences from the latter cor-\nrelative intentional influences\"5 (p. 349).\n4.

His patience and\nscrupulousness must, in principle, undo the tangle. At stake is phenomenology's\n\"principle of principles.\" If the description does not bring to light an absolutely\nand simply founding ground of signification, if an intuitive and perceptive\nground, a pedestal of silence, does not found discourse in the originally given\npresence of the thing itself, if the texture of the text, in a word, is irreducible,\nnot only will the phenomenological description have failed but the descriptive\n\"principle\" itself will have been put back into quesiton. The stakes of this\ndisentanglement are therefore the phenomenological motif itself.\nMirror Writing\nHusserl begins by delimiting the problem, by simplifying or purifying its givens.\nHe then proceeds to a double exclusion, or if you will, to a double reduction,\nbowing to a necessity whose rightful status was acknowledged in the Investi-\ngat ions, and which will never again be put into question. On the one hand, the\nsensory face of language, its sensory and nonmaterial face, what might be called\nthe animate \"proper body\" (Leib) of language, is put out of circulation. Since,\naccording to Husserl, expression supposes an intention of meaning (Bedeutungs-\nintention), its essential condition is therefore the pure act of animating intention,\nand not the body to which, in some mysterious fashion, intention unites itself\nand gives life. It is this enigmatic unity of informing intention and informed\nmatter that Husserl authorizes himself to dissociate from the outset. This is why,\non the other hand, he defers\u2014forever, it seems\u2014the problem of the unity of the\ntwo faces, the problem of the union of soul and body. \"Let us start from the\nfamiliar distinction between the sensory, the so to speak bodily aspect (leiNiche\nSeite) of expression, and its nonsensory 'mental' aspect.

This question will receive its full\nformulation only after a certain progress of the analysis: \"how to interpret the\n'expressing' of 'what is expressed,' how expressed experiences stand in relation\nto those that are not expressed, and what changes the latter undergo when\nexpression supervenes; one is then led to the question of their 'intentionality,'\nof their 'immanent meaning,' of their 'content' (Mat erie) and quality (i.e. the act-\ncharacter of the thesis), of the distinction of this meaning and these phases of\nthe essence which lie in the pre-expressive from the meaning of the expressing\nphenomenon itself and its own phases, and so forth. One gathers still in various\nways from the writings of the day how little justice is apt to be done to the great\nproblems here indicated in their full and deep-lying significance\" (p. 348).\nCertainly this problem already had been posed, notably at the beginning of\nthe sixth of the Logical Investigations. But here, the path which leads to it is\ndifferent; and not only for very general reasons (access to an openly transcen-\ndental problematic, appeal to the notion of noema, acknowledged generality of\nthe noetico-noematic structure), but particularly because of the distinction, arisen\nin the interval, between the concepts of Sinn and Bedeutung. Not that Husserl\nnow accepts this distinction proposed by Frege, one that he had objected to in\nthe Investigations.8 Rather, he simply finds it convenient to reserve the pair be-\ndeuten-Bedeutung for the order of expressive meaning (vouloir-dire), for discourse\nitself, and to extend the concept of sense (Sinn) to the totality of the noematic\nface of experience, whether or not it is expressive.9\nOnce the extension of sense absolutely overflows the extension of meaning,\ndiscourse will always have to draw upon its sense.

This is one of the\nreasons why the essence of logical meaning is determined as expression (A us-\ndruck). Discourse is expressive in its essence, because it consists in transporting\nto the outside, in exteriorizing a content of interior thought. It is never without\nthe sich \u00e4usseru which was spoken of in the first of the Investigations (sec. 7).\nThus, we are already in possession of the first distinctive trait of the expressive\nstratum. If it proffers only a constituted sense, physically or not, it is essentially\nreproductive, that is, unproductive. Husserl's analysis is on its way to this defi-\nnition in its first stage: \"The stratum of expression\u2014and this constitutes its\npeculiarity\u2014apart from the fact that it lends expression to all other intention-\nalities, is not productive. Or if one prefers: its productivity, its noematic service,\nexhausts itself in expressing, and in the form of the conceptual which first comes with\nthe expressing\" (pp. 348-49).\nThis unproductivity of the logos is embodied, if we may put it thus, in the\nHusserlian description. It again permits itself to be seduced by two metaphors\nto which we cannot not pay attention.\nThe first seems to pass by Husserl unnoticed. It is displaced between a writing\nand a mirror. Or rather, it says mirror writing. Let us follow its constitution.\nIn order to set forth the difference between Sinn and Bedeutung, Husserl recurs\nto a perceptual example, the silent perception of a \"white thing.\" In a certain\nway, the statement \"this is white\" is perfectly independent of the perceptual\nexperience. It is even intelligible for someone who has not had this perception.\nAnd the Investigations had demonstrated this rigorously. This independence of\nthe expressive value equally implies the independence of the perceptual sense.\nWe can make this sense explicit: \"This process makes no call whatsoever on\n'expression,' neither on expression in the sense of verbal sound nor on the like\nas verbal meaning, and here the latter can also be present independently of the\nverbal sound (as in the case when this sound is 'forgotten')\" (p. 347).\nConsequently, the transition to being stated adds nothing to sense, or in any'\nevent adds no content of sense; and yet, despite this sterility, or rather because\nof it, the appearance of expression is rigorously new. Because it only reissues\nthe noematic sense, in a certain way, expression is rigorously novel. To the\nextent that it neither adds nor in any way deforms, expression can always in\nprinciple repeat sense, by providing access to \"conceptual form\": \"If we have\n'thought' or stated 'This is white,' a new stratum is there with the rest, and unites\nideality of the work of art and of its relations to perception account for the differences\nbetween the musical and the plastic work, between the literaiy and the nonliterary work\nin general? And, moreover, do the precautions taken by Husserl concerning the originality\nof the imaginary, even at their most revolutionary, suffice to lift the work of art from an\nentire metaphysics of art as reproduction, from a mimetics? One could show that art,\naccording to Husserl, always refers to perception as to its ultimate resource. And is it not\nalready an aesthetic and metaphysical decision to offer works of art as examples in a theory\nof the imaginary?\n163\n"

Thus, everything must be capable\nof being said, everything must be capable of attaining the conceptual generality\nwhich properly constitutes the logic of the logos. And this not despite but\nbecause of the originality of the logical medium of expression: in effect, this\noriginality consists in not having to erase itself as an unproductive transparency\nfacing the passageway of sense.\nBut this transparency must have some consistency: not only in order to express,\nbut primarily in order to let itself be impressed by what afterward it will give to\nbe read: \"From the noetic standpoint the rubric 'expressing' should indicate a\nspecial act-stratum to which all other acts must adjust themselves in their own\nway, and with which they must blend remarkably in such wise that every no-\nematic act-sense, and consequently the relation to objectivity which lies in it,\nstamps itself (sick auspragt: impresses, strikes itself) 'conceptually' (begrifflich) in\nthe noematic phase of the expressing\" (p. 347).\nThus, the preexpressive noema, the prelinguistic sense, must be imprinted\nin the expressive noema, must find its conceptual mark in the content of mean-\ning.

Once the inscription of the sense in it renders it\nlegible, the logical order of conceptuality will be constituted as such. It then will\noffer itself begrifflich, in graspable, manipulable, conceivable, conceptual fashion.\nThe order of the concept is inaugurated by expression, but this inauguration is\nthe redoubling of a preexisting conceptuality, since it first will have had to\nimprint itself on the naked page of meaning. Following the implacable necessity\nof these two concepts, production and revelation are united in the impression-\nexpression of discourse. And since Husserl, here, is not considering the verbal\norder, with all its \"entangled\" (physical and intentional) complexity, but the still\nsilent intention of meaning (the moment when Bedeutung has appeared, which\nis more than sense, but has not yet effectively and physically proffered itself),\nit must be concluded that sense in general, the noematic sense of every expe-\nrience, is something which by its nature already must be capable of imprinting\nitself in a meaning, leaving or receiving its formal mark in a Bedeutung.

In particular, if there is an original history and permanence of con-\ncepts\u2014such as they are already and uniquely inscribed in meaning, supposing\nthat meaning can be separated from the history of language and of signifiers\u2014\nconcepts themselves are always older than sense, and in turn constitute a text.\nEven if, in principle, one could suppose that some textual virginity in jib\nfern pore\nwelcomed the first production of sense, in fact the systematic order of meaning\nin some way would have had to impose its sense upon sense, dictating the form\nof sense, obliging it to imprint itself according to a given rule, syntactic or\notherwise. And this \"in fact\" is not one empirical necessity among others; it\ncannot be put between parentheses in order to pose transcendental questions\nof rightfulness, since the status of meaning cannot be fixed without simulta-\nneously determining the status of sense. The placing of this \"fact\" between\nparentheses is a decision concerning the status of sense in general in its relations\nto discourse. This gesture does not come out of phenornenology, but opens it noncriticalby.\nAnd although Husserl never afterward put this juridical \"anteriority\" of sense\nin relation to meaning (of Sinn in relation to bedeu ten) back into question, it is\ndifficult to see how it can be reconciled with his future thematic, for example\nthat of The Origin of Geometry.

In any event Husserl displays a certain discomfort.\nAnd there would be much to think about in Husserl's attribution of the indecision\nof his description to the accidental metaphoricity of language, to precisely what\nhe calls the Bildlichkeit of discourse. It is because discourse occasionally must\nutilize images, figures, and analogies\u2014which would be as its debris\u2014that logos\nmust be described simultaneously as the unproductivity of the Abbildung and\nas the productivity of the Einbildung. If one eliminated the Bildlichkeit in descrip-\ntive discourse, by the same token one would eliminate the apparent contradiction\nbetween Abbildung and Einbildung.

Science would need what it\nneeds (discourse as pure meaning) to be useless: it is only to preserve and to\nglance at the sense which science confers upon it. Nowhere else can discourse\nsimultaneously be more productive and more unproductive than as an element\nof theory.\nWhich indeed confirms\u2014if this unproductive prpductivity is the telos of expres-\nsion\u2014that logico-scientific discourse has never ceased to function, here, as the\nmodel of every possible discourse.\nThe entire analysis, henceforth, will have to be displaced between two con-\ncepts or two values. On the one hand, ideal discourse will have to accomplish\nan overlapping or a coincidence (Deckung) of the nonexpressive stratum of sense\nand of the expressive stratum of meaning.

The example\nHusserl has just cited in effect belongs to the language of daily life, and it may\nstill be assumed that the mission and power of scientific expression consist in\nmastering these shadows and restituting the completeness of the sense aimed\nat in expression.\nAt the risk of compromising an axiom (the unproductive and reflective value\nof expression), Husserl also brings to light an essential noncompletion of expres-\nsion, an insufficiency that no effort ever will be able to overcome, precisely\nbecause it has to do with conceptual form, the\nformality without which\nexpression would not be what it is. Although Husserl, above, apparently wanted\nto stress the reflective, reproductive, repetitive nature of expression, its Abbilden,\nthereby neutralizing, in return, its effects, and its marks, its power to deform\nor refract, that is, its Einbilden, now, on the other hand, he stresses an essential\ndisplacement of expression that will forever prevent it from\nthe stratum\nof sense (Sinn): and this difference is nothing less than the difference of the\nconcept. We must read the entire paragraph: \"An incompleteness of a totally\ndifferent kind (Eine total andere Unvollstandigkeit) from the one just discussed is\nthat which belongs to the essential nature of the expression as such, namely,\nto its generality (Ailgemeinheit). 'I would like,' expresses the wish in a general\nform; the form of command, the command; 'might very well be' the presumption,\nor the likely as such, and so forth. Every closer determination in the unity of\nthe expression is itself again expressed in general form. It lies in the meaning\nof the generality which belongs to the essential nature of the expressing function\nthat it would not ever be possible for all the specifications of the expressed to\nbe reflected (sich reflektieren) in the expression. The stratum of the meaning\nfunction is not, and in principle is not, a sort of duplication (Reduplikation) of\nthe lower stratum\" (p. 352).\nAnd referring to the entire problematic of complete and incomplete expres-\nsions in the Logical Investigations, Husserl then mentions the values of the un-\nderlying layer which in principle cannot be repeated in expression (the qualities\nof darity, of distinction, attentional modifications, etc.).\nThis impoverishment is the condition for scientific formalization. Unequivo-\ncality is furthered in the extent to which the complete repetition of sense in\nmeaning is given up. Therefore, one cannot even say that a factual, accidental,\ninessential noncompleteness is reduced via a teleology of scientific discourse,\nor that it is included as a provisional obstacle within the horizon of an infinite\ntask. The felos of scientific discourse bears within itself, as such, a renunciation\nof completeness. Here, the difference is not a provisional deficiency of the\n168\n"

In other words, if we consider the history of philosophy\nas one great discourse, a powerful discursive chain, is not that history immersed\nin a reserve of language, the systematic reserve of a lexicology, a grammar, a set\nof signs and values? And once this is so, is not the history of philosophy limited\nby the resources and the organization of that reserve?\nHow to determine this language of philosophy? Is it a \"natural language,\" or\na family of natural languages (Greek, Latin, Germanic, Indo-European, etc.)?\nIs it rather a formal code elaborated on the basis of these natural languages?\nThese questions have an old history, doubtless going back to the origin of phi-\nlosophy itself. But they cannot be reelaborated without displacing the pairs of\nconcepts which constitute philosophy. These pairs, for example natural lan-\nguage/formal language, language/speech, etc. having been produced by philo-\nsophical discourse, belong to the field which they are to dominate; which,\nwithout stripping them of all authority, makes them incapable of mastering the\nrelation of philosophical \"discourse\" to its constraints.\nMoreover, at a given moment these questions, which long remained special\nand virtual ones, become dominant and obsessing. This is certainly not insig-\nnificant as concerns the \"historical\" relation of philosophy to its proper limit\nand to the singular form of this closure. This singularity is manifested regularly\nalong the lines of the following turn: whoever alleges that philosophical discourse\nbelongs to the closure of a language must still proceed within this language and\nwith the oppositions it furnishes. According to a law that can be formalized,\nphilosophy always reappropriates for itself the discourse that de-limits it.\nFinally, although the question about these linguistic constraints has a certain\nphilosophical permanence, the form in which we are advancing the question\ntoday has doubtless been constituted within a very particular and very complex\nhistorico-theoretical configuration. This configuration is bound to numerous\nfields of criticism but above all remains inseparable from the development of\nhistorical linguistics in the nineteenth century. In reminding the philosopher\nthat he remains endosed in a language, Nietzsche was surely more violent and\nmore explicit than anyone else, but he was also exploiting a possibility that had\nbeen coming to the surface almost everywhere for a half century, even if most\noften reappropriated by philosophical interest. In this situation, Nietzschean\ndiscourse, no more than any other,\nnot simply escape the law of reap-\npropriation. For example, Nietzsche determines as liberation (or liberty of\nthought) the movement which ilnally would free us from the language and\ngrammar that until now have governed the philosophical order. Quite tradi-\ntionally, he thus comes to define the law of language or of the signifier as a\n\"slavery\" from which one must be freed, and, at the most critical or \"overturn-\n177\n"

Has not philosophy always recalled\nthe arbitrariness of the sign in order to posit the contingent and superficial\nexteriority of language to thought, the secondariness of the sign in relation to\nthe idea, etc.? With an entirely other aim, Nietzsche must resort to an analogous\nargument: \"Only by means of forgetfulness (Vergesslichkeit) can man ever arrive\nat imagining that he possesses 'truth' in that degree just indicated.

A grammatical function?'\nA lexicological function? This is a question that will be determined later.\nThe example of the stone or the serpent illustrated a semantic or lexicological\narbitrariness.

Benveniste starts from a certain\nnumber of generally acknowledged\u2014at least since Saussure\u2014characteristics of\nlanguage. In the first place, \"the reality of language\" is \"unconscious,\" which\nresembles Saussure's propositions concerning the fact that \"language is not a\nfunction of the speaking subject.\" We will not pause to consider this premise,\nwhich raises more than one difficulty, however, and not only because of its\nempirical form. (\"In their diversity, these uses [of language] have, however, two\ncharacteristics in common. One is that the reality of language, as a general rule,\nremains unconscious\"; p. 55.) What does \"reality of language\" mean here? What\nis the status of \"reality\" in the phrase \"reality of language\"? Why only \"as a\ngeneral rule\"? Is it or is it not an essential predicate of the so-called reality to\nremain unconscious? The difficulty of distinguishing conscious from uncon-\nscious is at its most obscure when the issue is one of language or of the use of\nlanguage. And the difficulty is not attenuated, quite to the contrary, when the\nunconscious risks becoming an indistinct consciousness (\"The reality of lan-\nguage, as a general rule, remains unconscious; except when language is espe-\ncially studied for itself, we have no more than a very faint and fleeting awareness\nof the operations which we accomplish in order to talk\"; p. 55), or when the\nactivity of linguistics, in its relation to language, is determined as a coming to,\nor an increase of, consciousness. These questions are raised neither to emphasize\nwhat are doubtless secondary links in Benveniste's demonstration, nor to object\nto his discourse, but merely to indicate an example of the aporias that appear\nto engage anyone who takes on the task of defining the constraints which limit\nphilosophical discourse; for it is from the latter that the noncritical notions which\nare applied to its delimitation must be borrowed. The notions of system, form,\ncontent, which serve to define the characteristics of language, equally could\nhave given us pause (\"Now this language has a configuration in all its parts\nand as a totality. It is in addition organized as an arrangement of distinct and\ndistinguishing 'signs,' capable themselves of being broken down into interior\nunits or of being grouped into complex units. This great structure, which includes\nsubstructures of several levels, gives its form to the content of thought\"; p. 55).\nThe notion of a linguistic system, even if opposed to the notions of logical system,\nor system of categories, and even if one attempted to reduce the latter to the\nformer, would never have been possible outside the history (and) of the concepts\nof metaphysics as theory, episteme, etc. Whatever the displacements, breaks, and\nsecondary discontinuities of every kind, (and they surely have to be taken very\nstrictly into account), this filiation has never been absolutely interrupted. Ben-\nveniste acknowledges this elsewhere:8 and here he acknowledges that he must\n8. Problems, p. 18: \"Everyone knows that western linguistics originated in Greek phi-\nlosophy.

The category is one of- the ways\nfor \"Being\" to say itself or to signify itself, that is, to open language to its\nexterior, to what is in that it is or such as it is, to truth. \"Being\" is given in\nlanguage, precisely, as that which opens language to nonlanguage, beypnd what\nwould be only the (\"subjective,\" \"empirical,\" in the anachronistic sense of these\nwords) interior of a language. It is evident\u2014and Benveniste formulates this\nexplicitly\u2014that to reduce the categories of thought to categories of language is\nto affirm that a language's pretentions to \"thought,\" that is, to truth, universality,\nthe ontological, are unjustifiable. But as it happens, the category of the category\nis but a systematic setting in place of the pretension to an exterior of language,\nmaking it both language and thought because language is examined at the site\nwhere the signification \"Being\" is produced.\nAmong the several presentations of the categories, the most complete list is\nprobably the one cited by Benveniste (Categories, chap. 4, 1, b 25). But the text\nof the Metaphysics (E 2 1026 a 33), which also proposes a list of the categories,\nprecedes this list with a kind of principial definition. The categories answer the\nquestion of knowing in what ways Being is said, since it is said pollakOs, in many\nways: \"The science which studies this will be prior to physics, and will be\nprimary philosophy and universal in this sense, that it is primary. And it will\nbe the province of this science to study Being qua Being (kai pen tou ontos liii on,\ntaut\u00ebs an eu theoresai); what it is (ti esti), and what the attributes are which belong\nto it qua Being (kai ta huparkhonta hei on). But since the simple term 'being' (to\nhaplOs legomenon: Haplos: simply, frankly, in a word, without detour) is used in\nvarious senses (pollakOs legetai'), of which we saw that one was accidental (kata\nsumbeb\u00e9kos), and another true (Os al\u00ebthes), not-being being used in the sense of\nfalse (kai to me on Os to pseudos); and since besides these there are the categories\n(ta skh\u00ebmata t\u00ebs kategorias), e.g. the 'what' (ti), quality (poion), quantity (poson),\nplace (pou), time (pote), and any other similar meanings (ei ti allo\nton\ntropon touton).\"\u00b0\nThus, Aristotle knows that he is examining the ways of saying11 being in that\nit is pollakOs legomenon. The categories are the figures (skh\u00ebmata) according to\nwhich the \"simple term\" being is said in that it is said in several ways, through\nseveral tropes. The system of the categories is the system of being's turns of\n10. Metaphysics, trans. Hugh Tredenick (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1933),\nchap. 6 (2 1026 a 33), p. 299.\n11. This is what Aubenque recalls (\"Aristote et le langage,\" p. 104): \"Thus it is a fact\nof language__the equivocality of Being\u2014that Aristotle overtly has in mind and that he\nattempts to regulate, or as we have said, 'to administer' with a procedure that is itself\n'linguistic': the distinction of the multiple significations of the contested word. Conversely,\nAristotle nowhere presents the categories as properties of things or as laws of thought.\nTherefore, one cannot impute to Aristotle an alleged 'unconsciousness' of the relations\nbetween his ontology and language.\"\n183\n"

The most precise and systematic attempt here was Trendelenburg's\n(1846). \" As Aubenque\" also recalls, Benveniste has an immediate predecessor,\nwhom at times he even seems to paraphrase, in the person of Brunschvicg. In\nhis Les Ages de l'infelligence (1939), Brunschvicg also accused Aristotle of taking\n\"the universe of discourse\" for \"the universe of reason;' believing that thereby\nhe could unmask \"the entirely verbal character of his ontology,\" \"and doubtless\nof every ontology,\" for \"Being as Being is the kind of word that cannot be more\nthan a word.\" \"He [Aristotlej seeks knowledge of things only in sensory per-\nception. . . and in language, or, more accurately, in the language that he spoke,\nwhose particularities he unconsciously [my italics] elevates into the necessary and\nuniversal conditions of thought.\"7 Which means, as Brunschvicg says elsewhere\nciting Serrus, that Aristotle would only have \"made explicit a certain sponta-\nneous metaphysics of the Greek language.\" Aubenque further cites a thesis of\nRougier's: \"Bergson said that Aristotle's metaphysics is the spontaneous me-\ntaphysics of the human mind: it would be more correct to say that it is the\nspontaneous metaphysics of the Indo-European languages, and of the Greek\nlanguage in particular.\"8\nCassirer, who has never been cited in this debate, is surely Benveniste's most\nremarkable and immediate predecessor. In \"The Influence of Language on the\nDevelopment of Thought in the Natural Sciences,\" he also recalls the previous\nattempts, notably Trendelenburg's: \"When Aristotle, in his analyses of the the-\nory of categories, follows language and commits himself to its guidance, there\nis nothing to discuss about his procedure, from a modern point of view. But we\nwould demand that he carefully distinguish between the 'universal' and the\n'particular,' and that he not make of certain determinations, which find their\n14.

Each of them is given by its designation and followed by its equivalent:\nousia ('substance'), substantive; poion, poson ('what kind, in what number'), ad-\njectives derived from pronouns like the Latin qualis and quantus; pros ti ('relating\nto what'), comparative adjective; pou ('where'), pote ('when'), adverbs of place\nand time; keisthai ('to be placed'), middle voice; ekhein ('to be in a state'), the\nperfect; poiein ('to do'), active voice; paskhein ('to undergo'), passive voice\" (p.\n60).\nThus, the linguist transcribes in terms of language what the philosopher pre-\nviously, \"unconsciously\" transposed, or projected from language into terms of\nthought:\n\"We have thus an answer to the question raised in the beginning which had\nled us to this analysis. We asked ourselves what was the nature of the relationship\nbetween categories of thought and categories of language. No matter how much\nvalidity Aristotle's categories have as categories of thought, they turn out to be\ntransposed from categories of language. It is what one can say which delimits\nand organizes what one can think. Language provides the fundamental config-\nuration of the properties of things as recognized by the mind. This table of\npredication informs us above all about the dass structure of a particular language.\n\"It follows that what Aristotle gave us as a table of general and permanent\nconditions is only a conceptual projection of a given linguistic state\" (p. 61).\nTranscription, here, does not amount to a translation, that is to an mt ru-linguistic\nmovement assuring the transport of a signified from one language to another,\nfrom one system of signifiers to another. Thus, one cannot call translation the\npassage from a categorial (nonlinguistic) structure said to be of \"thought,\" to\na linguistic categorial structure said to be of \"language.\" The sense of \"tran-\nscription,\" therefore, refers back to what is called \"transposition\" or \"projection\"\nfurther on.

This does not imply\nthat Aristotle is the author or origin of the concept of empiricity, even if the\nopposition of the empirical and the theoretical (the a priori, the scientific, the\nobjective, the systematic, etc.) in one way or another envelops Aristotle's me-\ntaphysics. Even if such a concept is not fixed once and for all in an \"origin,\" one\ncannot comprehend the history and system of its mutations or transformations\nwithout taking into account the general code of metaphysics, and within this\ncode, the decisive mark of Aristotelianism.

What\nBenveniste very quickly calls the \"notion of 'being' \" is no longer one category\nthat is simply homogeneous with all the others: it is the transcategorial condition\nof the categories. Benveniste recognizes this: \"Beyond the Aristotelian terms,\nabove that categorization, there is the notion of 'being' which envelops every-\nthing. Without being a predicate itself, 'being' is the condition of all predicates\"\n(p. 61). We must read this reminder within the immense vein which flows from\nthe\n(which Benveniste's phrase reminds us of, almost literally: \"Many\nforms differing from one another but induded in one greater form, and again\none form evolved by the union of many wholes and of many forms entirely\napart and separate\"),26 through Aristotle's affirmation that Being is not a genre,\nthrough the affirmation found in the\nReason (\" 'Being' is obviously\nnot a real predicate; that is, not a concept of someihing which could be added\nto the concept of a thing.

Nor is it elsewhere. The linguist or the\nlogician who wishes to establish a rule of transliteration or correspondence\nbetween categories of language and categories of thought will never encounter\nsomething he might simply call \"Being.\"\nWhat Benveniste discovers then, by virtue of this further \"elaboration,\" is the\nabsolutely unique relationship between the transcendental and language. Here\nwe are taking the word \"transcendental\" in its most rigorous accepted sense,\nin its most avowed \"technicalness,\" precisely as it was fixed in the course of the\ndevelopment of the Aristotelian problematic of the categories, including what-\never remains beyond the categories. Transcendental means transcategorial.

In this case the function of the copula\ngoverned the interpretation of the meaning of \"to be\" invisibly, in having always\nsomehQw worked it from within.\nHeidegger: \"We understand the verbal substantive 'Being' through the infin-\nitive, which in turn is related to the 'is' and its diversity that we have described.\nThe definite and particular verb form 'is,' the third person singular of the present\nindicative, has here a pre-eminent rank. We understand 'Being' not in regard to\nthe 'thou art,' 'you are,' 'I am,' or 'they would be,' though all of these, just as\nmuch as 'is,' represent verbal inflections of 'to be.' 'To be' is for us the infinitive\nof 'is.' And involuntarily, almost as though nothing else were possible, we\nexplain the infinitive 'to be' to ourselves through the 'is.'\n\"Accordingly, 'Being' has the meaning indicated above, recalling the Greek\nview of the essence of Being (Wesen des Seins) hence a determinateness which\nhas not just dropped on us accidentally from somewhere but has dominated\nour historical Being-there (geschichtliches Dasein)\" (p\u2022 77).\nHowever eternally troubled and worked upon from within, the fusion of the\ngrammatical and lexical functions of \"to be\" certainly bears an essential relation\nto the history of metaphysics and to everything coordinated to this history in\nthe West.\nThere is a strong, indeed barely repressible, temptation to consider the grow-\ning predominance of the formal function of the copula as a process of falling,\nan abstraction, degradation, or emptying of the semantic plenitude of the lexeme\n\"to be\" and of all lexemes which, likewise, have let themselves dwindle or be\nreplaced. Is not to examine this \"history,\" (but the word \"history\" belongs to\nthis process of meaning), as the history of meaning, and to ask the \"question\nof Being\" as the question of the \"meaning of Being\" (Heidegger), to limit the\ndestruction of classical ontology to a reappropriation of the semantic plenitude\nof \"Being,\" a reactivation of the lost origin, etc.?

Is it not to suspect a kind of original fall in the copula,\nwith all that such a perspective would imply?\nFinally, why does the horizon of meaning dominate the question of the linguist\nas well as the question of the philosophical thinker? What desire impels both\nthe one and the other, as what they are, to proceed analogically toward a su-\nperlapsanan agency, something before the supplement of copula? That their\nprocedures and horizons remain analogous in this respect, one sees in the\nfollowing:\n\"The entire range of the inflections of the verb 'to be' (scm) is determined by\nthree different stems.\n\"The first two stems to be named are Indo-European and also occur in the\nGreek and Latin words for 'Being.'\n203\n"

To read within a concept the hidden history of a metaphor is to privilege\ndiachrony at the expense of system, and is also to invest in the symbolist conception\nof language that we have pointed out in passing: no matter how deeply buried,\nthe link of the signifier to the signified has had both to be and to remain a link\nof natural necessity, of analogical participation, of resemblance. Metaphor has\nalways been defined as the trope of resemblance; not simply as the resemblance\nbetween a signifier and a signified but as the resemblance between two signs,\none of which designates the other. This is the most general characteristic of\nmetaphor, which is what authorizes us to group under this heading all the so-\ncalled symbolical or analogical figures mentioned by Polyphios (figure, myth,\nfable, allegory). In this critique of philosophical language, to take an interest in\nmetaphor\u2014in this particular figure\u2014is therefore also to take a symbolist stand.\nIt is above all to take an interest in the nonsyntactic, nonsystematic pole of\nlanguage, that is, to take an interest in semantic \"depth,\" in the magnetic at-\ntraction of the similar, rather than in positional combinations, which we may\ncall \"metonymic\" in the sense defined by Jakobson,\" who indeed emphasizes\nthe affinity between the predominance of the metaphorical, i.e. symbolism (as\nmuch, we would say, as a literary school as a linguistic conception)\u2014and ro-\nmanticism (as more historical, that is, historicist, and more hermeneutical). It\ngoes without saying that far from belonging to this problematic and sharing its\npresuppositions, the question of metaphor, such as we are repeating it here, on\nthe contrary should delimit them. However, the issue is not, symmetrically, to\nreaffirm what Polyphilos chooses as his target; it is rather to deconstruct the\nmetaphysical and rhetorical schema at work in his critique, not in order to reject\nand discard them but to reinscribe them otherwise, and especially in order to\nbegin to identify, the historico-problematic terrain on which philosophy system-\natically has been asked for the metaphorical rubrics of its concepts.\n3. The value of usure also has to be subjected to interpretation. It seems to\nhave a systematic tie to the metaphorical\npective. It will be rediscovered\nwherever the theme of metaphor is privileged.

Not that\nthe enterprise of the authors cited is entirely covered by this presupposition,\nbut, rather, the enterprise recurs to it every time it gives the metaphorical point\nof view the upper hand.

His critique of etymologism chose the proper as its example.\nHere, we cannot cite the entire critique of Destutt de Tracy, who plays on the words\nproperty and proper, as \"Stirner\" did with Mein and Meinung (mine, my opinion; Hegel did\nthis too), Eigentum and Eigenheit (property and individuality). We cite only the following\npassage, whose target is the reduction of economic science to the play of language. and\nthe reduction of the stratified specificity of concepts to the imaginary unity of an etymon:\n\"Above 'Stirner' refuted the communist abolition of private property by first transferring\nprivate property into 'having' and then declaring the verb 'to have' an indispensable word,\nan eternal truth, because even in communist society it could happen that Stimer will 'have'\na stomach-ache. In exactly the same way he here bases the impossibility of abolishing\nprivate property by transferring it into the concept of property ownership, by exploiting\nthe etymological connection between the words Eigentum (property) and eigen (proper,\nown), and dedaring the word eigen an eternal truth because a stomach-ache will be eigen\nto him.

Provisionally, let us take\nsuch a definition as granted. One then would have to acknowledge the impor-\ntation into so-called philosophical discourse of exogenous metaphors, or rather\nof significations that become metaphorical in\ntransported out of their own\nhabitat. Thus, one would classify the places they come from: there would be\nmetaphors that are biological, organic, mechanical, technical, economic, histor-\nical, mathematical\u2014geometric, topologic, arithmetic\u2014(supposing that in the\nstrict sense there might be mathematical metaphors, a problem to be held in\nreserve for now). This classification, which supposes an indigenous population\nand a migration, is usually adopted by those, not numerous, who have studied\nthe metaphorics of a single philosopher or particular body of work.\nIn classifying metaphors according to their native regions, one would nec-\nessarily\u2014and this has indeed happened\u2014have to reduce the \"lending\" dis-\ncourses, the discourses of the origin\u2014in opposition to the borrowing discourses\u2014\nto two major types: those which precisely appear more original in and of them-\nselves,2' and those whose object has ceased to be original, natural, primitive.\nThe first kind provides metaphors that are physical, animal, and biological, and\nthe second those that are technical, artificial, economic, cultural, social, etc. This\nderivative opposition, (of physis to tekhn\u00eb, or of physis to nomos), is at work\neverywhere. Sometimes the thread of the argument is not stated. It happens\nthat there is an alleged break with tradition. The results are the same. These\ntaxonomical principles do not derive from a particular problem of method. They\nare governed by the concept of metaphor and by its system (for example, the\noppositions of the place of origin, the etymon, and the proper, to all their others),\n21. Those which primarily are encountered in nature demand only to be picked, like\nflowers. The flower is always youthful, at the greatest proximity to nature and to the\nmorning of life. The rhetoric of the flower, for example in Plato, always has this meaning.\nSee Symposium 183e, 196a\u2014b, 203e, 210c; Republic 474e, 60Th; and Politics 273d, 310d, etc.\n220\n-\n"

This time we would be dealing\nnot with a kind of psychoanalysis of the material imagination applied to a rather\nindeterminate corpus,3\u00b0 but rather with a rhetorical analysis of the philosophical\ntext, supposing that assured criteria were available for identifying this text as\nsuch. This would lead to an inevitable intersection of the classification of the\nnative regions of metaphor with a general grid, no longer constituted on the\nbasis of these elementary regions of phenomena (what appears), but on the basis\n28.

In\nDer Satz rem Grund he insists above all on the opposition sensory/nonsensory, an inipor-\ntant, but neither the only, nor the first, nor the most determining characteristic of the\nvalue of metaphor. \"But here, the following remark will suffice: Since our hearing and\nseeing are never a simple reception by the senses, it is not any longer suitable to affirm\nthat the interpretation of thought as grasped by hearing (als Er-horen) and vision (Er-blicken)\nrepresent only a metaphor (Ubertragung), a transposition into the non-sensory of the so-\ncalled sensory. The notion of 'transposition' and of metaphor (Mete pher) rest on the dis-\ntinction, not to say the separation, of the sensory and the non-sensory as two domains\neach subsisting for itself. This kind of separation between the sensory and the non-sensory,\nbetween the physical and the non-physical, is a fundamental characteristic of what is\ncalled 'metaphysics,' which confers upon Western thought its essential characteristics.\nOnce this distinction of the sensory and the non-sensory is recognized as insufficient,\nmetaphysics loses its rank as authoritative thought.

Without\ntaking into account that the separation between sense (the signified) and the\n' senses (sensory signifier) is enunciated by means of the same root (sensus, Sinn).\nOne might admire, as does Hegel, the generousness of this stock, and interpret\nits secret rel\u00e9ve speculatively, dialectically; but before utilizing a dialectical con-\ncept of metaphor, one must examine the double turn which opened metaphor\nand dialectics, permitting to be called sense that which should be foreign to the\nsenses.\nThus, the general taxonomy of metaphors\u2014so-called philosophical metaphors\nin particular\u2014would presuppose\nsolution of important problems, and pri-\nmarily of problems which constitute the entirety of philosophy in its history.\nThus a metaphorology would be derivative as concern\nwould dominate, whether it does\nas its rule the explicit conscious-\nness ot the\nor the systematic and objective structure of his text,\nwhether it reconstitutes a meaning or deciphers a symptom, whether or not it\nelaborates an idiomatic metaphorics (proper to a philosopher, a system, or a\nparticular body of work) based on a more general, more constricting, more\ndurable metaphorics. The concept of metaphor, along with all the predicates\nthat permit its ordered extension and comprehension, is a philosopheme.\nThe consequences of this are double and contradictory. On the one hand it\nis impossible to dominate philosophical metaphorics as such, from the exterior,\nby using a concept of metaphor which remains a philosophical product. Only\nphilosophy would seem to wield any authority over its own metaphorical pro-\nductions. But, on the other hand, for the same reason philosophy is deprived\nof what it provides itself. Its instruments belonging to its field, philosophy is\nincapable of dominating its general tropology and metaphorics. It could perceive\nits metaphorics only around a blind spot or central deafness. The concept of\nmetaphor would describe this contour, but it is not even certain that the concept\nthereby circumscribes an organizing center; and\nlaw holds for ev\u00e7ry\nphiosopheme.

We will not fail to do so. Certainly,\nAristotle invented neither the word nor the concept of metaphor. However, he\nseems to have proposed the first systematic situating of it, which in any event\nhas been retained as such with the most powerful historical effects. It is indis-\npensable to study the terrain on which the Aristotelian definition could have\nbeen constructed. But this study would lose all pertinence if it were not preceded,\nor in any event controlled, by the systematic and internal reconstitution of the\ntext to be reinscribed. Even if partial and preliminary the task is not limited to\na commentary on a textual surface. No transparency is granted it. The issue\nalready is one of an active interpretation setting to work an entire system of\nrules and anticipations.\n\"Metaphor (metaphora) consists in giving (epiphora)3' the thing a name (onon:-\natos) that belongs to something else (allotriou), the transference being either from\ngenus to species (apo tou genous epi eidos), or from species to genus (apo tou eidous\nepi to genos), or from species to species (apo tou eidous epi eidos), or on the grounds\nof analogy (e kata to analogon)\" (1457b6\u20149).\nThis definition, doubtless the most explicit, the most precise, and in any event\nthe most general,3' can be analyzed along two lines. It is a philosophical thesis\n35. TN. Demda's citation of the Greek terms is particularly important here. The French\ntranslation of epiphora as \"transport\" preserves a \"metaphoric\" play on words that is lost\nin the English rendering \"giving.\" Meta-phora and epi-phora have the same root, from the\nGreek pherein, to carry, to transport.\n36. This generality poses problems which recently have been reactivated in a way, as\nis well known. We will come back to them in our conclusion. In any event, Aristotle is\nthe first to consider metaphor as the general form of all the figures of words, whether\nmetaphor includes them (as in these examples of transport by metonymy or synecdoche),\nconstitutes their economy (abridged comparison), or finds its own best form in the analogy\nof proportionality (Rhetoric Ill). Doubtless this generality is proportional to the impover-\nishment of the determination of metaphor. Aristotle, from early on, was accused or excused\nfor this. \"Some Ancients have condemned Aristotle for putting under the name of met-\naphor the first two, which properly are but synecdoches; but Aristotle spoke in general,\nand he was writing at a time when there was still no refinement of figures, both in order\nto distinguish them and in order to give to each the name which would have best explained\nits nature. Cicero justifies Aristotle sufficiently when he writes in his De Oratore: Itaque\ngenus hoc Graeci appellant allegoricum, nonzine recte, genere melius ille (Aristoteles) qui ista omnia\ntranslationes vocal.\" Andr\u00e9 Dacier, Introduction a la po\u00e9tique d'Aristote, 1733.

As a genre these tropes can be reduced to a\nsingle one, Metaphor, whose name, which is so well known, and perhaps better\nknown than the thing itself, has lost, as Laharpe observes, all its scholarly\nimport. Metaphor is not ordinarily distinguished into species, like Metonymy and\nSynecdoche; however it must not be thought that it has but a single form, a single\naspect, and that it is the same in every case. On the contrary, it is quite varied,\nand doubtless extends further than Metonymy and Synecdoche, for not only the\nnoun, but further the adjective, the participle, the verb, and finally all species\nof words belong to its domain. Thus all species of words can be employed, or\nin effect are employed, metaphorically, if not as figures, at least as catachreses. The\nspecies of words capable of being employed metaphorically asfigures are the noun,\nthe adjective, the participle, the verb, and perhaps also the adverb, although\nrather rarely\" (p. 99).\nNow, on the one hand, everything excluded from this list of words is reserved\nfor the catachresis of metaphor, a \"not true figure,\" which \"embraces in its\nextension even the interjection.\" (\"There are even very few words, in each\nspecies, not under its domination,\" p. 215. We will come back to this problem\nlater.) True metaphor, therefore, keeps within the limits of the Aristotelian\n\"noun.\" Which, on the other hand, appears to be confirmed throughout the\nentire system of distinctions proposed by Fontanier in his general definition of\nwords. Among these words corresponding to \"ideas of an object\"\u2014which nat-\nurally can be nominalized.\u2014are dassed nouns, all words \"employed substan-\ntively\" (the beautiful, the true, the just; eating, drinking, sleeping; the for, the against;\nthe front, the back; the why, the how; the inside, the outside; the huts, the ifs, the whys,\nthe wherefores), and active or passive participles. The first group corresponds to\nsubstantive ideas of object, and the second to concrete ideas of object. Among the\nwords corresponding to the \"ideas of relationship\" are classed the verb (\"But\nby verb, here, I understand only the properly named verb, the verb to be, called\nof a \"comparison which is in the mind.\" It remains that Aristotle made of metaphor a\nrather extended genre, as we have seen, in order to cover every other nominal figure,\nincluding metonymy; that Fontanier restricts the field of metaphor (and therefore of anal-\nogy or of resemblance) in order to oppose it to metonymy; and that Du Marsais at first,\nby etymology, had loosened the limits of metonymy: \"The word rnetonvmy signifies trans-\nposition or changing of name, one name for another. In this sense, this figure includes\nall the other Tropes; for in all Tropes, a word not being taken in the meaning proper to\nit, it awakens an idea that might be expressed by another word. In what follows, we will\nnotice what properly distinguishes metonymy from the other Tropes. The masters of the\nart restrict metonymy to the following uses:\" (Du Marsais, II, 2). Condilac (whose phi-\nlosophy, more than any other, or at least like every other, might be considered as a treatise\non analogy) advances a symmetrically inverse proposition: \"What we have said of com-\nparisons must be applied to metaphors. I will bring to your attention only that if one\nconsults etymology, all tropes are metaphors: for metaphor properly signifies a word\ntransported from one meaning to an other\" (Dc l'art d'\u00e9crire II, vi).\n235\n"

      "full_text": "The Ellipsis of the Sun\ncomposition, on the basis of meaning and reference, that the human voice should\nbe distinguished from the call of an animal. Meaning and reference: that is, the\npossibility of signifying by means of a noun. What is proper to nouns is to\nsignify something (Ta de onornata s\u00ebmainei ti; Rhetoric III, 10, 1410b11), an inde-\npendent being identical to itself, conceived as such. It is at this point that the\ntheory of the name, such as it is implied by the concept of metaphor, is articulated\nwith ontology. Aside from the classical and dogmatically affirmed limit between\nthe animal without logos and man as the z\u00f6on logon ekhon, what appears here is\na certain systematic indissociability of the value of metaphor and the meta-\nphysical chain holding together the values of discourse, voice, noun, signifi-\ncation, meaning, imitative representation, resemblance; or, in order to reduce\nwhat these translations import or deport, the values of logos, phOne semantik\u00eb,\ns\u00ebmainein, onoma, mimisis, homoiosis. The definition of metaphor is in its place\nin the Poetics, which opens as a treatise on mim\u00ebsis. Mimesis is never without the\ntheoretical perception of resemblance or similarity, that is, of that which always\nwill be posited as the condition for metaphor. Homoiosis is not only constitutive\nof the value of truth (al\u00ebtheia) which governs the entire chain; it is that without\nwhich the metaphorical operation is impossible: \"To produce a good metaphor\nis to see a likeness\" (To gar eu metapherein to to homoion theOrem\nestin. 1459a7\u20148).\nThe condition for metaphor (for good and true metaphor) is the condition for\ntruth. Therefore it is to be expected that the animal, deprived of logos, of phone\ns\u00ebmanfik\u00eb, of stoikheion, etc., also would be incapable of mimesis. Mimesis thus\ndetermined belongs to logos, and is not animalistic aping, or gesticular mimicry;\nit is tied to the possibility of meaning and truth in discourse. At the beginning\nof the Poetics mim\u00ebsis in a way is posited as a possibility proper to physis. Physis\nis revealed in mimesis, or in the poetry which is a species of mirn\u00easis, by virtue\nof the hardly apparent structure which constrains mim\u00ebsis from carrying to the\nexterior the fold of its redoubling. It belongs to physis, or, if you will, physis\nincludes its own exteriority and its double. In this sense, mim\u00ebsis is therefore a\n\"natural\" movement. This naturality is reduced and restricted to man's speech\nby Aristotle. But rather than a reduction, this constitutive gesture of metaphysics\nand of humanism is a teleological determination: naturality in general says itself,\nreassembles itself, knows itself, appears to itself, reflects itself, and \"mimics\"\nitself par excellence and in truth in human nature. M\u00fcn\u00ebsis is proper to man.\nOnly man imitates properly. Man alone takes pleasure in imitating, man alone\nlearns to imitate, man alone learns by imitation. The power of truth, as the\nunveiling of nature (physis) by mim\u00ebsis, congenitally belongs to the physics of\nman, to anthropophysics. Such is the natural origin of poetry, and such is the\nnatural origin of metaphor: \"It is clear that the general origin of poetry was due\nto two causes, each of them part of human nature (physikai). Imitation is natural\n(symphyton: innate, congenital) to man from childhood, one of his advantages\nover the lower animals being this, that he is the most imitative creature\n(mirnCtik\u00f4taton) in the world and learns at first (math\u00ebseis protas: first knowledge)\n237\n"

And logos is in its element only in phone. It belongs\nthere better than elsewhere. And this is always so according to a teleological\ndetermination: just as the destination of nature is to be mimed best in human\nnature, and just as man, more than any other animal, properly imitates (mi-\nmetikOtaton), so the voice is the organ most apt to imitate.

Or\nrather, its ancillary status: metaphor, when well trained, must work in the service\nof truth, but the master is not to content himself with this, and must prefer the\ndiscourse of full truth to metaphor. For example, Aristotle reproaches Plato for\nbeing satisfied with \"poetic metaphors\" (metaphoras legein poietikas) and for keep-\ning to hollow language (kenologein) when he says that Ideas are the paradigms\nin which other things participate\nA9, 991a20, M5, 1079b25).\nFor the same reason, pleasure, the second \"cause\" of mim\u00ebsis and metaphor,\nis the pleasure of knowing, of learning by resemblance, of recognizing the same.\nThe philosopher will be more apt at this than anyone else. He will be man par\nexcellence: \"The explanation is to be found in a further fact: to be learning,\nsomething is the greatest of pleasures, not only to the philosopher, but to the\nrest of mankind, however small their capacity for it\u2014the reason of the delight\nin seeing the picture (eikonas) is that one is at the same time learning, and\ndeducing (syllogizesthai) what is represented\" (Poetics, 1448b12\u201417). Book 3 of the\nRhetoric specifies this idea, between a stalk and a flower: \"We all naturally (physei)\nfind it agreeable to get hold of new ideas easily: words (onomata) signify some-\nthing (s\u00ebmainei ti), and therefore those words are the most agreeable which bring\nus knowledge of something new. . . From metaphor. . . we can best get hold\nof something fresh. When the poet calls old age a 'withered stalk' (kalam\u00ebn) he\nconveys a new idea, a new fact, to us by means of the general notion of 'lost\n41. \"Metaphors must be drawn, as has been said already, from things that are related\nto the original thing, and yet not obviously so related (apo oikeiOn kei me phanerOn)\u2014just\nas in philosophy also an acute mind will perceive resemblances (to homoion .\ntheorem)\neven in things far apart\" (Rhetoric lii, ii, 1412a9\u201412).\n238\n"

The\nlimit does not divide the human from the animal. Another division furrows the\nentirety of \"human\" language. This latter division is not homogenous, is not\nhuman in all its aspects, and to the same degree. The noun still remains the\ndetermining criterion: included in the literal elements, the asemantic vocal\nemissions, are not only letters themselves. The syllable belongs to lexis, but of\ncourse has no meaning in itself. Above all, there are whole \"words\" which play\nan indispensable role in the organization of discourse, but still remain, from\nAristotle's point of view, totally without meaning. The conjunction\nis a phone as\u00ebmos. This holds equally for the article, for articulation in general\n(art hron), and for everything that functions between signifying members, between\nnouns, substantives, or verbs (Poetics 1456b38\u20141457a10).

It is even born of this accommodation.\nThe n\u00fcmeme is neither the thing itself nor something totally other. Nothing will upset the\nlaw of this pleasure according to the economy of the same and of difference, not even\u2014\nespecially not\u2014the horror, ugliness, and unbearable obscenity of the imitated thing, as\nsoon as it remains out of sight and out of reach, off stage. We would have to follow the\nchain of examples which have obsessed this classical topos, from Aristotle to Lessing. As\nalways, when the mimetic ellipsis is in play, Oedipus, the serpent, and parricide are not\nfar off. \"Though the objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight to view the\nmost realistic representations of them in. art, the forms for example of the lowest animals\nand of dead bodies. . . the reason of the delight in seeing the picture is that one is at the\nsame time learning and deducing (manthanein kni syllogizesthai) what is represented, for\ninstance, that this figure is such and such a person\" (Poetics 1448b10\u201417). \"II n'est point\nde serpent ni de monstre odieux I Qui par l'art imit\u00e9, ne puisse plaire aux yeux: / D'un\npinceau d\u00e9licat l'artifice agr\u00e9able / Du plus affreux objet fait un objet aimable. / Ainsi pour\nnous charmer, La Tragedie en pleurs I D'Oedipe tout sanglant fit parler des douleurs I\nD'Oreste parricide exprima les alarmes, / Et, pour nous divertir, nous arracha des larmes.\"\nBoileau, Art Poetique, Chant 11, 1-S. l\"There is no serpent or odious monster / That imitated\nby art cannot be pleasing to our eyes: /With a delicate brush agreeable artifice / Makes of\nthe most frightful object a pleasing one. / Thus, for our pleasure, the tearful Tragedy I Of\nOedipus, all bloody, spoke of sorrows / And of parricide Orestes sounded the alarum, /\nAnd, for our diversion, wrenched from us our tears.\" I Euripides' Orestes wished no longer\nto see in his dreams a head bristling with snakes. Longinus cited and commented on the\nlines of this scene; Boileau translated them. Within the same space, the same system, one\ncan also refuse the unbearable pleasure of such a representation. From La poEt ique by Jules\nde Ia Mesnardi\u00e8re (1639): \"Beautiful descriptions are certainly agreeable. . . But whatever\npowerful attractions these marvelous paintings might have, they should represent only\nthings that are pleasant or at least bearable. A fine palette is to be employed for subjects\nthat are not odious, and one should not work like those bizarre painters who put their\nentire science in the portrayal of a snake or some horrid reptile.\"\n44. The Rhetoric also treats the good usage of the conjunction (III, v) and the effects of\nthe asyndeton, the suppression of the conjunction (Ill, xu).\n240\n"

If this analogy imposes itself\u2014and\nit does\u2014then it is that within language the analogy itself is due to a long and\nhardly visible chain whose first link is quite difficult to exhibit, and not only for\nAristotle.

Everything\nturns around it, everything turns toward it.\nAnd yet, in one sentence, in a parenthesis that is immediately closed, Aristotle\nincidentally invokes the case of a lexis that would be metaphorical in all its\naspects. Or at least no proper name is present in it, is apparent as such. Im-\nmediately after the solar sowing, here is the \"wineless cup\": \"There is\nanother form of qualified metaphor. Having given the thing the alien name, one\nmay by a negative addition deny of it one of the attributes naturally associated\n-'\nwith its new name.

No reference properly being named in such a metaphor,\nthe figure is carried off into the adventure of a long, implicit sentence, a secret\nnarrative which nothing assures us will lead us back to the proper name. The\nmetaphorization of metaphor, its bottomless overdeterminability, seems to be\ninscribed in the structure of metaphor, but as its negativity. As soon as one\nadmits that all the terms in an analogical relation already are caught up, one by\none, in a metaphorical relation,\nbegins to function no longer as a/\nsun, but as a star, the punctual source of truth or properness remaining invisible\n243\n"

This no\nlonger holds for the significations kurion and idion, which are both generally\ntranslated by the same word: proper.52 Althougfithe difference between kurion\nand idion is never given thematic exposition, it seems that kurion, more frequent\nin both the Poetics and the Rhetoric, designates\nin its dominant, master,\nLet us not forget that this sense of sov-\nereignty is also the tutelary sense of kurion. By extension, kurion is interpreted\nas theprimitive (as opposed to\nand sometimes is used as the\nequivalent of the usual, literal, familiar sense (to de kurion kai to oikeion [Rhetoric,\nIII, II, 1404b6]): \"By the ordinary word (kurion) I mean that in general use in a\ncountry\" (Poetics 1457b3\u20144). Kurion is then distinguished, on the one hand, from\nthe unusual, rare, idiomatic word (glotta), and from metaphor, on the other. As\nfor idion, which is much rarer in this context, it seems to participate in the two\nother meanings. More precisely, in the Rhetoric (ifi, V. 1407a31) to employ the\nproper name is to avoid the detour of periphrasis (tois idiois onornasi legein, kai\nme tois periekhousin), which is the correct thing to do. The contamination of these\nthree values seems already accomplished in the Ciceronian notion of verba propria\nas opposed to verba translata (De oratore 2.4).\nHowever, the value of the idion seems to support this entire metaphorology,\nwithout occupying center stage. We know that in the Topics, for example, it is\nat the center of a theory of the proper, of essence, and of accident. Now, if\nmetaphor (or mim\u00ebsis in general) aims at an effect of cognition, it cannot be\ntreated without being placed in relation to a knowledge that bears on definitions:\non what the thing of which one speaks is, properly, essentially, or accidentally.\nCertainly one may speak properly or improperly of what is not proper to the\nthing, its accident, for example. Here, the two values properness/improperness\ndo not have the same locus of pertinence. Nevertheless, the ideal of every\nlanguage, and in particular of metaphor, being to bring to knowledge the thing\nitself, the turn of speech will be better if it brings us closer to the thing's essential\ntruth. The space of language, the field of its divisions, is opened\nprecisely by the difference between essence, the proper, and accident. Three\ntreference points, preliminarily.\n1. A noun is proper when it has but a single sense. Better, it is only in this\ncase that it is properly a noun. Univocity is the essence, or better, the telos of\nlanguage. No philosophy, as such, has ever renounced this Aristotelian ideal.\nThis ideal is philosophy. Aristotle recognizes that a word may have several\nmeanings. This is a fact.\nthis fact has right of entr\nonly jr\nthe extent to which the polysemia is finite, the different significations are limited\nin number, and above all sufficiently distinct, each remaining one and identifi-\n51. See, for example, Rhetoric III, 7. On the translation of prepon see Brunschwig's note\nto his edition of Les Topiques d'Arisfote (Paris: Belles Lettres, 1966), p. 6, note 3.\n52. TN. As will be seen in the next few citations from Aristotle, kurion and idion are not\ntranslated into English by the same word (\"proper\"), although they are in French. How-\never, these concepts do belong to the system of concepts of the\n(literal, correct,\nusual, individual, particular, belonging) that Derrida is analyzing here.\n247\n"

Which is to be expected since the code is forced, but strange because\nthe abuse is no more a form of usage than an application of the code: \"There\nis a Trope that we have accepted, like Du Marsais, but to which we have neither\nassigned a rank, nor devoted an article in our Theory: this is Catachresis.

But Tropes occur, either by\nnecessity and extension, in order to supplement the words for certain ideas which are\nmissing from language, or by choice and figure, in order to present ideas with more vivid\nand striking images than their own signs. Whence two different kinds of tropological sense:\nthe extended tropological sense and the figurative tropological sense. The first, as one can see,\nstands between the primitive sense and the figurative sense, and can hardly be regarded as\nanything but a new kind of proper sense\" (pp. 57\u201458). What is interesting to us here, thus,\n')) is the production of a proper sense, a new kind of proper sense, by means of the violence\nof a catachresis whose intermediary status tends to escape the opposition of the primitive\nand the figurative, standing between them as a \"middle.\" When the middle of an op-\nposition is not the passageway of a mediation, there is every chance that the opposition\nis not pertinent.

The work to be undertaken under the\nheading of such a meta-metaphorics would not be without interest. In sum, it\nwould amount to transporting into the philosophical order the Bachelardian\nprogram of a metapoetics (Lautr\u00e9amont, p. 55),M What would the limits of such\na transposition be?\nBachelard, on this point, is faithful to tradition: metaphor does not appear to\nhim either simply or necessarily to constitute an obstacle to scientific or philo-\nsophical knowledge. It can work for the critical rectification of a concept, reveal\na concept as a bad metaphor, or finally \"illustrate\" a new concept. In the process\nof scientific knowledge the \"verbal obstacle\" often has the form of metaphor\n(\"metaphoric contrivance,\" \"generalized image,\" \"deficient metaphorical char-\nacter of the explanation\"65 etc.), doubtless. And doubtless the domain of met-\naphor is extended even beyond language, taken in the strict sense of verbal\n\"expression\": \"metaphors seduce reason.\"6' But, on the one hand, the psycho-\nanalysis of objective knowledge above all must denounce \"immediate meta-\nphors\" ('The danger of immediate metaphors in the formation of the scientific\nspirit is that they are not always passing images; they push toward an auton-\nomous kind of thought; they tend to completion and fulfillment in the domain\nof the image\";67 as we will see, it is\nof metaphors that interests\nBachelard initially); and on the other hand, a nonimmediate, constructed met-\naphor is useful when it comes to \"illustrate\" knowledge wrested from bad\nmetaphor. Its value is then essentially pedagogical: \"A psychoanalysis of objec-\ntive knowledge, then, must set itself to blanching, if not to erasing, these naive\n64.

Ibid., p. 78. Bachelard cites Van Swinden: \"'The expression that iron is a sponge\nof magnetic Fluid is therefore a metaphor that departs from the true: and yet all the ex-\nplanations are founded on this expression used in the proper, literal sense. But as for myself,\nI think that it is not exact .\n.\n. to think that reason indicates that these expressions are\nerroneous, and nevertheless to use them in the explanation of Experiments' (1785). In a\nsomewhat confused form, Van Swinden's thought is quite clear: one cannot so easily as\nis alleged confine metaphors only to the realm of expression. Whether one wishes it or\nnot, metaphors seduce reason.\" Immediately afterward, Bachelard shows that \"very great\nminds have been blocked, so to speak, in primary imagery.\" Thus, \"Descartes's meta-\nphysics of space\" would be but a metaphorics of the sponge, \"the metaphysics of the\nsponge\" (p. 79).\n67. Ibid., p. 81. On the contrary, however, the Preliminary Discourse of the work accredits\nthe constructed and constructive metaphors, the metaphors of intermediary status which\nbreak with sensory immediacy and naive realism. They belong to the order of \"figurative\nquantity, midway between the concrete and the abstract, in an intermediary zone.\" \"Sci-\nentific thought then is drawn off in the direction of 'constructions' that are more meta-\nphoncal than real, 'spaces of configuration' whose sensory space, after all, is but an\nimpoverished example\" (p. 5).\n.,cQ\n"

For Aristotelian science, the ellipse is a poorly made circle, a flattened circle.\nFor Newtonian science, the circle is an impoverished ellipse, an effipse whose\ncenters have been flattened one onto the other. I made myself the advocate of\nthe ellipse: the center of the ellipse is useless because of its two distinct focal\npoints; for the circle, the law of areas is a banality; for the effipse, the law of\nareas is a discovery. Little by little, I slowly attempted to pry the mind loose\nits attachment to privileged images .\n.\n. Also, I have little hesitation in\npresenting rigor as a psychoanalysis of intuition, and algebraic thought as a\npsychoanalysis of geometric thought. Even in the domain of the exact sciences,\n'our imagination is a sublimation. It is useful, but it can fool us to the extent that\nwe do not know what we sublimate and how we sublimate it.

This is surely the occasion to recall that in Bachelard's opinion the\nmetaphoric obstacle is not only an epistemological obstacle due to the persistence, in the\nfield of science, of nonscientific schema deriving from the popular imagination or from\nthe philosophically imaginary. The metaphoric obstade is sometimes a philosophical one,\nwhen scientific schema are imported into a philosophical domain without rhyme or reason.\nOne might speak then of an epistemologizing obstacle. A certain naive scientifism on the\npart of the philosopher can transform scientific discourse into a vast reservoir of metaphors\nor \"models\" for hurried theoreticians. \"Science offers itself to the philosopher as a par-\nticularly rich collection of well constructed and well tied together knowledge. In other\nwords, the philosopher simply demands examples of science.\" These examples \"are always\nmentioned, never developed. Occasionally, the scientific examples are commented upon\naccording to principles which are not scientific ones; they lead to metaphors, analogies,\ngeneralizations.\" La Philosophie\nnon (Paris, 1940), p. 3. In the same direction, see also\nthe end of the chapter on \"the diverse metaphysical explanations of a scientific concept,\"\nand what Bachelard says about the anagogical reverie as a mathematizing reverie, at the\nmoment when the mathematical and the arithmetical intervene in the position of meta-\nphors (pp. 38-40).\n70.

This new articulation, without importing all the metaphysics of the\nclassical opposition, should also account for the specific divisions that episte-\nmology cannot overlook, the divisions between what it calls metaphoric eff?cts\nand scientific effects. The need for this new articulation has undoubtedly been\ncalled for by Nietzsche's discourse. It will have to provoke a displacement and\nan entire reinscription of the values of science and of truth, that is, of several\nothers too.\nI Such a redistribution would have to permit the definition of the \"figure\" which\nnecessarily continues to give its \"sign\" to a \"concept\" after rectification, after\nabandoning a given model \"which perhaps, after all, was only a metaphor.\"6\nThus\u2014second example\u2014when the biological concept of circulation of the blood\nis substituted for the technical concept of irrigation,\" the rectification has not\nreduced every figure of speech.

Georges Can-\nguilhem writes, concerning Bichat's Treatise on Membranes (1800): \"The term 'tissue' de-\nserves to give us pause. Tissue comes, as is well known, from tistre, an archaic form of\nthe verb tisser, to weave. If the word cell has appeared to be overburdened with implicit\nsignifications of an affective and social order, the word tissue appears no less burdened\nwith extra-theoretical implications. Cell makes us think of the bee, and not of man. Tissue\nmakes us think of man, and not of the spider. Tissue, a weave, is the human product par\nexcellence\" (La connaissance de la vie, pp. 64\u201465). See also Marx: \"We have to consider labour\nin a form peculiar to the human species. A spider carries on operations resembling those\nof the weaver; and many a human architect is put to shame by the skill with which a bee\nconstructs her cell. But what from the very first distinguishes the most incompetent\narchitect from the best of bees, is that the architect has built a cell in his head before he\nconstructs it in wax. The labour process ends in the creation of something which, when\nthe process began, already existed in the worker's imagination, already existed in an ideal\nform. What happens is, not merely that the worker brings about a change of form in\nmaterial objects, at the same time, in the nature that exists apart from himself, he realizes\nhis own purpose, the purpose which gives the law to his activities, the purpose to which\nhe has to subordinate his own will\" (Capital, book 1, chap. 5, pp. 169\u201470).\n76. \"On this point, thus, experimental embryology and cytology have rectified the\nconcept of organic structure that was too narrowly associated by Claude Bernard with a\nsocial model that perhaps, after all, was only a metaphor.\" \"Le tout et Ia partie dans Ia\npens\u00e9e biologique,\" in Etudes d'histoire et de philosophic des sciences, p. 332.\n77. See La connaissance de la vie, pp. 22\u201423.\n78. From a purely rhetorical point of view, Condillac displays much severity concerning\nthe figures of speech used by Plato (\"the greatest philosopher and the greatest rhetorician\")\nto describe the human body, which he makes into \"a monster that escapes the imagina-\ntion\"; most notably when \"he says that the blood is the grazing ground of the flesh: and so,\nhe goes on, that all the parts may receive nourishment, they have dug, as in a garden, several\ncanals, so that the streams of the veins, emerging from the heart as from their source, can flow in\nthese narrow channels of the human body.\" Condillac contrasts this with six lines from Rous-\nseau, and comments on them thus: \"The flowers which multiply on a stem watered by\na pure stream are a beautiful image of what the love of glory produces in an elevated\nsoul\" (\"Dc I'art d'\u00e9crire,\" in Oeuvres phi!osophiques, p. 555).\n263\n"

As soon as one retains only a\npredicate of the circle (for example, return to the point of departure, closing of\n1the circuit), its signification is put into the position of a trope, of metonymy if\nnot metaphor.\nIs rectification henceforth the rectification of a metaphor by a concept? Are\nall metaphors, strictly speaking, concepts, and is there any sense in setting\nmetaphor against concept? Does not a scientific critique's rectification rather\nproceed from an inefficient tropic-concept that is poorly constructed, to an op-\nerative tropic-concept that is more refined and more powerful in a given field\nand at a determined phase of the scientific process? The criterion of this progress\nor mutation (\"break,\" \"remodeling,\" and many other forms that should be dis-\ntinguished from each other), has not been defined, certainly, but a double cer-\ntainty now seems problematic: 1. That this criterion must necessarily put to work\na rhetorical evaluation (\"from metaphor to concept,\" for example); 2. That tropes\nmust necessarily belong to the prescientific phase of knowledge.\nIn other words, there is also a concept of metaphor: it too has a history, yields\nknowledge, demands from the epistemologist construction, rectifications, critical\nrules of importation and exportation.\nWe come back to our question: can one transport into the philosophical field\nthe Bachelardian program of a metapoetics?\nproposes to proceed by\ngroups and diagrams, and this is what will retain us first. By groups:\n\"When one has meditated on the freedom of metaphors and on their limits,\none perceives that certain poetic images are projected onto one another with\ncertainty and exactitude, which amounts to saying that in projective poetry they\nare but one and the same image. In studying the Psychoanalysis of fire, we have\nperceived, for example, that all the 'images' of the internal fire, the hidden fire,\nthe fire glowing beneath the embers, in short the unseen fire that consequently\ncalls for metaphors, are 'images' of life. The projective link, then, is so primitive\nthat one easily translates, certain of universal comprehension, images of life into\nimages of fire, and vice versa. The deformation of the images then must des-\nignate, in a strictly mathematical way, the group of metaphors. Immediately that\none can specify the diverse groups of metaphors of a particular poetry, one would\nperceive that occasionally certain metaphors fail because they have been added\nin defiance of the cohesion of the group. Naturally, sensitive poetic souls react\nby themselves to these erroneous additions, without needing the pedantic ap-\nparatus to which we are alluding. But it remains no less that a metapoetics will\nhave to undertake a classification of metaphors, and that sooner or later it will\nhave to adopt the only essential procedure of classification, the determination\nof\n79. Gaston Bachelard, LautrEamont, pp. 54\u201455. Here, the projective model permits one to\nrecognize not only the syntactic coherence of metaphors, but above all the original and\nfinal unity of their theme, their central semantic focal point. The demonstration of this\npoint, moreover, is rather remarkable: the multiplicity of images (the images of fire, with\nwhich this metaphorology first had to concern itself) refers, while reflecting it, to the same\n264\n"

If there were only one\npossible metaphor, the dream at the heart of philosophy, if one could reduce\ntheir play to the circle of a family or a group of metaphors, that is, to one\n\"central,\" \"fundamental,\" \"principial\" metaphor, there would be no more true\nmetaphor, but only, through the one true metaphor, the assured legibility of the\nproper. Now, it is because the metaphoric is plural from the outset that it does\nnot escape syntax; and that it gives rise, in philosophy too, to a text which is\nnot exhausted in the history of its meaning (signified concept or metaphoric\ntenor: thesis), in the visible or invisible presence of its theme (meaning and truth\nof Being). But it is also because the metaphoric does not reduce syntax, and on\nthe contrary organizes its divisions within syntax, that it gets carried away with\nitself, cannot be what it is except in erasing itself, indefinitely constructing its\ndestruction.\nThis self-destruction always will have been able to take\ncourses which are\nalmost tangent, and yet different, repeating, miming, and separating from each\nother according to certain laws. One of these courses follows the line of a\nresistance to the dissemination of the metaphorical in a syntactics that some-\nwhere, and initially, carries within itself an irreducible loss of meaning: this is\nthe metaphysical rel\u00e8ve of metaphor in the proper meaning of Being. The gen-\n?ralization of metaphor can signify this parousia. Metaphor then is included by\nJmetaphysics as that which must be carried off to a horizon or a proper ground,\nand which must finish by rediscovering the origin of its truth.

Their plastic\nseverity and solidity does not tolerate the sort of blending involved in metaphor\nor permit them to stray hither and thither away from the homogenous material\nand the simple, self-contained, complete cast, in order to gather up so-called\n'flowers' of expression (sogennante Blumen des Ausdrucks aufzulesen) here and\nthere. But metaphor is always an interruption of the course of ideas (Vorstel-\nlungsganges) .\n. . On the other hand, it is particularly the East, especially the\nlater Mohammedan poetry, which uses figurative expressions and indeed has\nthem of necessity.\"8'\nMetaphor, therefore, is determined by philosophy as a provisional loss of\nmeaning, an economy of the proper without irreparable damage, a certainly\ninevitable detour, but also a history with its sights set on, and within the horizon\n\u2022of, the circular reappropriation of literal, proper meaning. This is why the phil-\nevaluation of metaphor always has been ambiguous: metaphor is\ndangerous and foreign as concerns intuition (vision or contact), concept (the grasp-\ning or proper presence of the signified), and consciousness (proximity or self-\npresence); but it is in complicity with what it endangers, is necessary to it in the\nkextent to which the de-tour is a re-turn guided by the function of resemblance\n(mim\u00ebsis or homoi\u00f6sis), under the law of the same. The opposition of intuition,\nthe concept, and consciousness at this point no longer has any pertinence. These\nthree values belong to the order and to the movement of meaning. Like meta-\nphor.\nHenceforth the entire teleology of meaning, which constructs the philosophical\nconcept of metaphor, coordinates metaphor with the manifestation of truth, with\nthe production of truth as presence without veil, with the reappropriation of a\nfull language without syntax, with the vocation of a pure nomination: without\ndifferential syntax, or in any case without a properly unnarnable articulation that\nis irreducible to the semantic rel\u00e8ve or to dialectical interiorization.\nThe.other self-destructiotiof metaphor thus resembles the philosophical one to\nthe point of being taken for it. This time, then, in traversing and doubling the\nfirst self-destruction, it passes through a supplement of syntactic resistance,\nthrough everything (for example in modern linguistics) that disrupts the op-\nposition of the semantic and the syntactic, and especially the philosophical\nhierarchy that submits the latter to the former. This self-destruction still has the\nform of a generalization, but this time it is no longer a question of extending\nand confirming a philosopheme, but rather, of unfolding it without limit, and\nwresting its borders of propriety from it.

They tend to erase the breaks, the tremors working within\nspeech and writing in what is called \"natural language,\" which is also, from the\nstart, a diastemic organization, a system of \"arbitrary\" signs, or in any event\nof discrete and diacritical signs.

Here we might elaborate the motif of a\ncritique of formalist illusion which would complicate what is often considered\nto be Valery's formalism somewhat. The complication is due to the fact that\nformality, far from simply being opposed to it, simultaneously produces and de-\nstroys the naturalist, \"originarist\" illusion. Always insufficiently formalized, still\ntoo embroiled in natural language, in natural language's vagueness, equivocal-\nness, and metaphoricity, philosophical writing does not support comparison\nwith its model: the rigor and exactitude of a purely formal language. Valery has\njust recalled the effort of the philosopher wearing himself out in making his\nthoughts speak: \"Today, in a number of truly remarkable cases, even the expression\nof things by means of discrete signs, arbitrarily chosen, has given way to lines\ntraced by the things themselves, or to transpositions or inscriptions directly\nderived from them.

There\nis, in any thinker of such intellectual power, what might be described as a home\npolicy and a foreign policy of thought; he sets up certain 'reasons of state' against\nwhich nothing can prevail ...

Descartes could assert himself, posit his mastery, only by \"paying with\nhis person,\" exposing himself in a theater, putting himself on stage and into\nplay \"by risking the I.\" And henceforth at issue are the style of his writing and\nthe timbre of his voice.\nHow are we to reassemble these propositions? Will it be said that Descartes,\nby means of what is inimitable in his text (timbre and style), has succeeded in\nimposing the source, in restoring the presence of the origin that is so implacably\nset aside by the play of signification?\n23. \"At this point I am going to take a considerable risk. I say that we can consider it\nfrom a very different point of view\u2014we can assert that this brief and pregnant expression\nof its author's personality has no meaning whatever.

No one dreams of saying or needs to say 'I am' unless he is taken for dead and\nwants to protest that he is not. In any case he would say 'I'm alive.' But a cry or the\nslightest movement would be quite sufficient. No, 'I am' cannot tell anyone anything and\nis no answer to any intelligible question. But the remark does correspond here to something\nelse, which I shall explain presently. Furthermore, what meaning can be attributed to a\nproposition whose negative form would express its content just as well as the positive?\nIf '1 am' means anything, 'I am not' tells us neither more nor less\" (9, 54). In the Address\nto the Congress of Surgeons, Valery scans the formula: \"At one moment I think; at another\nI am\" (11, 139).\nI have proposed elsewhere an interpretation of the equivalence, \"I am\": \"I am living\":\n\"I am dead.\" Although made from a very different point of view, this interpretation\nnevertheless seems to me to intersect with Valery's.

All the motifs I have\nemphasized, and still others, to a certain point are in agreement, in any event\nin their principles, with Freud's motifs: redefinition of the I (the ego) and con-\nsciousness as effects in a system, development of the logic of a primary narcis-\nsism in relation to a death drive, systematic interest in everything that escapes\nthe control of waking consciousness (Valery's meditation on dreams was un-\nceasing), etc. One could pursue the correspondence of the two texts a long way.\nI do not know whether Freud read Valery, and since it is not his birthday, I leave\nsuspended the question of knowing why, and above all if he can be excused for\nthis. But why did Valery so nervously reject psychoanalysis? Why did he seize\nupon the argument of the unnamable that he just as summarily could have used\nagainst all science? The connotation of nervousness, of precipitation, and of\nspasm are not insignificant. Valery could have offered arguments, showed his\ndisagreement, asked epistemological questions, differentiated his criticisms, vig-\nilantly examined what then could be seen of psychoanalysis: but he did so only\nby opposing his formalist point of view\u2014which therefore produces an effect of\nobscurantism here\u2014to what he considered to be Freud's semantic, \"significa-\ntive\" point of view about\nBut why talk about Freud's \"stupidity\"?\nWhy multiply sarcastic remarks against those whom he names \"Freud and Co.\"?\nMost often it is the insistence on sexuality that infuriates him, and without\nrecognizing, wanting or being able to recognize, that Freud's \"sexualism\" is\n28. For example: \"1 have been concerned with dreams for centuries. Since then have\ncome the theses of Freud and Co., which are completely different\u2014because it is the\npossibility and intrinsic characteristics of the phen. which interest me; while for them, it\nis its meaning, its relation to the subject's history\u2014which I am not worried about.\" Valery\nhad just written: \"The small child of two years is transparent. Its impressions, its psyche,\nand its acts have very few waystations\" (C. 19, p. 456, 1936).\n\"My theories of the dream are completely opposed to those of the day. They are'com-\npletely 'formal,' while the latter are completely 'significative' \"(C. 17, p. 766, 1935). \"Now,\nI am inclined to think that these words have no meaning, that it is useless to look for\nmeaning in them, vain to give them meaning. And the reflex acts of the sleeper are only\nlinear responses. The sleeper discharges himself through the brain as through the limbs\u2014\nwithout past or future\u2014without additivity. For my way of thinking, it is a mistake to\napproach dreams by way of the significative\" (ibid., p. 771). See also p. 770, and the entire\nchapter \"Le r\u00e9ve et l'analyse de Ia conscience,\" in Judith Robinson, L'analyse de l'esprit dans\nles Cahiers de Valery (Paris: Corti, 1963). This semanticist error, if we may put it thus, is\nwhat from Valery's point of view deprives psychoanalysis of all scientificity, if not all\nefficacity. \"If Freud's theories have therapeutic value, it is highly probable that they have\nno scientific value\" (C. 11, p. 476, 1926). \"There are authors (and therefore theories at their\nservice) whose works, consciously founded on the unconscious, are comparable finally\nto the Flea Market\" (C. 17, p. 515, 1934).\nAs is inevitable in this situation of misconstruing, Valery, who calls himself \"the least\nFreudian of men\" (cited by Robinson, L'analyse, p. 105), occasionally makes statements\nthat Freud would not simply have rejected, at the very moment when it is believed that\nthese statements are in opposition to him. Thus: \"Freud's theories are repulsive to my\nway of thinking, which would have it that in dreams the ideas of the most insignificant\nthings from waking life play a role equal to that played by things which are moving, or\nwould be the most moving\" (C. 11, p. 621, 1925\u201426).\n300\n"

Does this Implex of yours amount to any more than what vulgar,\ncommon mortals, the masses, philosophers, psychologists, psychopaths, the\nnon-Crusoes\u2014the herd, in fact\u2014call quite simply and crudely the 'unconscious'\nor the 'subconscious.'?\n\"\u2014Do you want me to pitch you into the sea?.\n. . Don't you know I detest\nsuch dirty words?. . . And anyhow, it isn't the same thing at all. They are meant\nto signify some inconceivable hidden springs of action\u2014at times they stand for\nsly little inner goblins, marvelous tricksters, who can guess riddles, read the\nfuture, see through brick walls, and carry on the most amazing industry inside\nour hidden workings\" (5, 55\u201456).\nImmediately afterward defining the implex as virtuality and general capacity\n(\"for feeling, reacting, doing, and understanding\"), it is true that Valery adds\nto the end of the list the \"capacity for resistance\": \"To all that we must add our\ncapacity for resistance\" (5, 56).\nWe will not ask what the meaning of this resistance is before pointing out that\nwhat Valery intends to resist is meaning itself. What he reproaches\nanalysis for is not that it interprets in such or such a fashion, but quite simply\nthat it interprets at all, that it is an interpretation, that it is interested above all\nin signification, in meaning, and in some principial unity\u2014here, a sexual unity\u2014\nof meaning. He reproaches psychoanalysis for being a \"symbolics\"\u2014this is what\nhe names it\u2014a hermeneutism, a semanticism. Is there not, henceforth, a place\nwhere all of Valery's poetic and linguistic formalism, his very necessary critique\nof thematicist or semanticist spontaneity, in literature and elsewhere, all the\nirony with which he paralyzed the prejudices of meaning, theme, subject, con-\ntent, etc., a place, then, where all of these come to be articulated systematically\nwith his compulsive and obstinate rejection of psychoanalysis, a rejection op-\nerating as close as possible to psychoanalysis, and completely opposed to it?\nWas there not in meaning, to the extent that it is worked upon and afterward\nconstituted by repression, something which above all had not to be dealt with?\nSomething which formally had to be thrown back into the sea?\nAbove all I will not conclude that this hypothesis disqualifies Valery's critical\nformalism. Something within it remains necessary and must be maintained, it\nseems to me, in opposition to all precritical semanticisms. The psychoanalytic\ndiscourses known to us are far from being exempt from this semanticism. Per-\nhaps we here are touching upon a limit at which the opposition of form and\n304\n"

Following a strange figure of discourse, one first must ask\nwhether the word or signifier \"communication\" communicates a determined\ncontent, an identifiable meaning, a describable value.ItBut in order to articulate\nand to propose this question, I already had to anticipate the meaning of the\nword communication: I have had to predetermine communication as the vehicle,\ntransport, or site of passage of a meaning, and of a meaning that is one. If\ncommunication had several meanings, and if this plurality could not be reduced,\nthen from the outset it would not be justified to define communication itself as\nthe transmission of a meaning, assuming that we are capable of understanding\none another as concerns each of these words (transmission, meaning, etc.).\nNow, the word communication, which nothing initially authorizes us to overlook\nas a word, and to impoverish as a polysemic word, opens a semantic field which\nprecisely is not limited to semantics, semiotics, and even less to linguistics. To\nthe semantic field of the word communication belongs the fact that it also des-\nignates nonsemantic movements. Here at least provisional recourse to ordinary\nlanguage and to the equivocalities of natural language teaches us that one may,\nfor example, communicate a movement, or that a tremor, a shock, a displacement\nof force can be communicated\u2014that is, propagated, transmitted. It is also said\n/ that different or distant places can communicate between each other by means\nof a given passageway or opening.(What happens in this case, what is trans-\nmitted or communicated, are not phenomena of meaning or signification.\nthese cases we are dealing neither with a semantic or conceptual content, nor\nwith a semiotic operation, and even less with a linguistic exchange.\nNevertheless, we will not say that this nonsemiotic sense of the word com-\nmunication, such as it is at work in ordinary language, in one or several of the\nso-called natural languages, constitutes the proper or primitive meaning, and that\nconsequently the semantic, semiotic, or linguistic meaning corresponds to a\nderivation, an extension or a reduction, a metaphoric displacement. We will not\nsay, as one might be tempted to do, that semiolinguistic communication is more\nmetaphorico entitled \"communication,\" because\n\"real\" communication it gives passage, transports, raflsrn\nsQmething, gives\naccess to something We will not say so\n1. because the value of literal, proper meaning appears more problematical than\never,\n309\n"

Let us note\nmerely that it governs another equally decisive operative concept (here I am\nclassically, and for convenience, opposing operative to thematic) of the Essai: to\ntrace and to retrace.

I am asking the question in this form in order to forestall an objection.\nIn effect, it might be said to me: you cannot allege that you account for the so-\ncalled graphematic structure of locution solely on the basis of the occurrence of\nfailures of the performative, however real these failures might be, and however\neffective or general their possibility. You cannot deny that there are also per-\nformatives that succeed, and they must be accounted for: sessions are opened,\nas Paul Ricoeur did yesterday, one says \"I ask a question,\" one bets, one chal-\nlenges, boats are launched, and one even marries occasionally. Such events, it\nappears, have occurred. And were a single one of them to have taken place a\nsingle time, it would still have to be accounted for.\nI will say \"perhaps.\" Here, we must first agree upon what the \"occurring\"\nor the eventhood of an event consists in, when the event supposes in its allegedly\npresent and singular intervention a statement which in itself can be only of a\nrepetitive or citational structure, or rather, since these last words lead to con-\nfusion, of an iterable structure. Therefore, I come back to the point which seems\nfundamental to me, and which now concerns the status of the event in general,\nof the event of speech or by speech, of the strange logic it supposes, and which\noften remains unperceived.\nCould a performative statement succeed if its formulation did not repeat a\n\"coded\" or iterable statement, in other words if the expressions I use to open\na meeting, launch a ship or a marriage were not identifiable as conforming to an\niterable model, and therefore if they were not identifiable in a way as \"citation\"?\nNot that citationality here is of the same type as in a play, a philosophical\nreference, or the recitation of a poem. This is why there is a relative specificity,\nas Austin says, a \"relative purity\" of performatives. But this relative purity is\nnot constructed against citationality or iterability, but against other kinds of it-\neration within a general iterabiity which is the effraction into the allegedly\nrigorous purity of every event of discourse or every speech act. Thus, one must\nless oppose citation or iteration to the noniteration of an event, than construct\na differential typology of forms of iteration, supposing that this is a tenable\nproject that can give rise to an exhaustive program, a question I am holding off\non here. In this typology, the category of intention wifi not disappear; it will\nhave its place, but from this place it will no longer be able to govern the entire\nscene and the entire system of utterances. Above all, one then would be con-\ncerned with different types of marks or chains of iterable marks, and not with\nan opposition between citational statements on the one hand, and singular and\noriginal statement-events on the other. The first consequence of this would be\nthe following: given this structure of iteration, the intention which animates\nutterance will never be completely present in itself and its content.
