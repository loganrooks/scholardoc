I have attempted\nto indicate a way out of the closure of this framework via the \"trace,\" which is\nno more an effect than it has a cause, but which in and of itself, outside its text,\nnot sufficient to operate the necessary transgression.\nSince there is no presence before and outside semiological difference, what\nhas written about language can be extended to the sign in general:\n\"Language is necessary in order for speech to be intelligible and to produce all\nof its effects; but the latter is necessary in order for language to be established;\nthe fact of speech always comes first.\"3\nT Retaining at least the framework, if not the content, of this requirement for-\nmulated by Saussure, we will designate as differance the movement according\nto which language, or any code, any system of referral in general, is constituted\na weave of differences. \"Is constituted,\" \"is produced,\" \"is\ncreated,\" \"movement,\" \"historically,\" etc., necessarily being understood beyond\nthe metaphysical language in which they are retained, along with all their im-\nplications. We ought to demonstrate why concepts like production, constitution,\nand history remain in complicity with what is at issue here. But this would take\nme too far today\u2014toward the theory of the representation of the \"circle\" in\nrwhich we appear to be endosed\u2014and I utilize such concepts, like many others,\nonly for their strategic convenience and in order to undertake their deconstruc-\ntion at the currently most decisive point. In any event, it will be understood,\nby means of the circle in which we appear to be engaged, that as it is written\nhere, differance is no more static than it is genetic, no more structural than\nis no less so; and to object to this on the basis of the oldest of\nmetaphysical oppositions (for example, by setting some generative point of view\nagainst a structural-taxonomical point of view, or vice versa) would be, above\nall, not to read what here is missing from orthographical ethics. Such oppositions\nhave not the least pertinence to differance, which makes the thinking of it uneasy\nand uncomfortable.\nNow if we consider the chain in which differance lends itself to a certain number\nof nonsynonymous substitutions, according to the necessity of the context, why\nhave recourse to the \"reserve,\" to \"archi-writing,\" to the \"archi-trace,\" to \"spac-\ning,\" that is, to the \"supplement,\" or to the pharmakon, and soon to the hymen,\nto the margin-mark-march, etc.'4\n13.

The supplement (supplement) is Rousseau's word\nto describe writing (analyzed in Of Grammatology, trans. Gayatri Spivak IBaltimore: Johns\nHopkins University Press, 1976]). It means both the missing piece and the extra piece. The\npharmakon is Plato's word for writing (analyzed in \"Plato's Pharmacy\" in Dissesnination,\ntrans. Barbara Johnson IChicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981 1). meaning both remedy\nand poison; the hymen (l'hymen) comes from Derrida's analysis of Mallarm\u00e9's writing and\nMallarme's reflections on writing (\"The Double Session\" in Dissemination) and refers both\nto virginity and to consummation; ?nargc-?narque-marChe is the series en diffCrance that Derrida\napplies to Sollers's Nombres (\"Dissemination\" in Dissemination).\n12\n"

On two occasions he encounters the expression\ndifferente Beziehung in Hegel's text. This word (different), with its Latin root, is\nrare in German and, I believe, in Hegel, who prefers verschieden or ungleich,\ncalling difference Unterschied and qualitative variety Verschiedenheit. In the Jena\nLogic he uses the word different precisely where he treats of time and the present.\nBefore getting to a valuable comment of Koyre's, let us look at some sentences\nfrom Hegel, such as Koyre translates them: \"The infinite, in this simplicity, is,\nas a moment opposed to the equal-to-itself, the negative, and in its moments,\nalthough it is (itself) presented to and in itself the totality, (it is) what excludes\nin general, the point or limit; but in its own (action of) negating, it is related\nImmediately to the other and negates itself by itself.

In his translation of \"La differance\" (in Speech\nand Phenomena (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 19731), David Allison notes (p.\n144) that the citation from Hegel comes from \"Jensener Logik, Metaphysik, und Natur-\nphiosophie\" in S\u00e4,ntliche Werke (Leipzig: F.

But can one not conceive of a presence, and of a presence to itself of\nthe subject before speech or signs, a presence to itself of the subject in a silent\nand intuitive consciousness?\na question therefore supposes that, prior to the sign and outside it,\nexcluding any trace and any differance, something like consciousness is possible.\nAnd that consciousness, before distributing its signs in\nin the world,\ncan gather itself into its presence. But what is consciousness? What does \"con-\nsciousness\" mean? Most often, in the very form of meaning, in all its modifi-\ncations, consciousness offers itself to thought only as self-presence, as the\nperception of self in presence. And what holds for consciousness holds here for\nso-called subjective existence in general. Just as the category of the subject cannot\nBe, and never has been, thought without the reference to presence as hupokei-\nmenon or as ousia, etc., so the subject as consciousness has never manifested\ntitself except as self-presence.

Force itself is never present; it is only a play of differences and quantities.\nThere would be no force in general without the difference between forces; and\nhere the difference of quantity counts more than the content of the quantity,\nmore than absolute size itself. \"Quantity itself, therefore, is not separable from\nthe difference of quantity.

Thus one could reconsider all the pairs of opposites on\nwhich philosophy is constructed and on which our discourse lives, not in order\nto see opposition erase itself but to see what indicates that each of the terms\nmust appear as the differance of the other, as the other different and deferred in\nthe economy of the same (the intelligible as differing-deferring the sensible, as,\nthe sensible different and deferred; the concept as different and deferred, dif-\nfering-deferring intuition; culture as nature different and deferred, differing-\ndeferring; all the others of physis\u2014tekhne, nomos, thesis, society, freedom, history,\nmind, etc.\u2014as\ndifferent and deferred, or as physis differing and deferring.\nPhysis in differance.

The putting into question of the authority of consciousness\nis first and always differential.\nr\nThe two apparently different values of differance are tied together in Freudian\ntheory: to differ as discernibility, distinction, separation, diastem, spacing; and\nto defer as detour, relay, reserve, temporization.\n1. The concepts of trace (Spur), of breaching (Bahnung),2' and of the forces of\nbreaching, from the Project on, are inseparable from the concept of difference.\nThe origin of memory, and of the psyche as (conscious or unconscious) memory\nin general, can be described only by taking into account the difference between\nbreaches.

According to a schema that never\nceased to guide Freud's thought, the movement of the trace is described as an\neffort of life to protect itself by deferring the dangerous investment, by consti-\ntuting a reserve (Vorrat). And all the oppositions that furrow Freudian thought\nrelate each of his concepts one to another as moments of a detour in the economy\nof diff\u00e9rance.

(Although the phenomenologist is not the only one\nspeak this language.)\nThe structure of delay (Nachtraglichkeit) in effect forbids that one make of\ntemporalization (temporization) a simple dialectical complication of the living\npresent as an originary and unceasing synthesis\u2014a synthesis constantly directed\nback on itself, gathered in on itself and gathering\u2014of retentional traces and\nprotentional openings. The alterity of the \"unconscious\" makes us concerned1\nnot with horizons of modified\u2014past or future\u2014presents, but with a \"past\" that\nhas never been present, and which never will be, whose future to come will\nnever be a production or a reproduction in the form of presence. Therefore the\nconcept of trace is incompatible with the concept of retention, of the becoming-\npast of what has been present. One cannot think the trace\u2014and therefore,\ndiff\u00e9rance-_on the basis of the present, or of the presence of the present.\n-.1\nA past that has never been present: this formula is the one that Emmanuel\nLevinas uses, although certainly in a nonpsychoanalytic way, to qualify the trace\nand enigma of absolute alterity: the Other.24 Within these limits, and from this\npoint of view at least, the thought of differance implies the entire critique of\nclassical ontology undertaken by Levinas. And the concept of the trace, like that\nof diffErance thereby organizes, along the lines of these different traces and dif-\nferences of traces, in Nietzsche's sense, in Freud's sense, in Levinas's sense\u2014\nthese \"names of authors\" here being only indices-the network which reassem-\nbles and traverses our \"era\" as the delimitation of the ontology of presence.\nWhich is to say the ontology of beings and beingness. It is the domination of\nbeings that differance everywhere comes to solicit, in the sense that sollicitare, in\nold Latin, means to shake as a whole, to make tremble in entirety. Therefore,\nit is the determination of Being as presence or as beingness that is interrogated\nby the thought of differance. Such a question could not emerge and be understood\nunless the difference between Being and beings were somewhere to be broached.\nFirst consequence: differance is not. It is not a present being, however excellent,1\n24. TN.

The footnote invites several\nreadings. Here we do not aspire to undertake such readings, or even to sketch\nthem out. Rather, we are simply underlining the fact that they are indicated,\nand then opening the texts that Heidegger signals, marking their pages. Our\nonly ambition in commenting on this note is to attempt to extend it a bit, and\nto do so according to two motifs.\n1.

The following pages may be read as timid prologomena to a problem of translation.\nBut who better than Heidegger has taught us to think what is involved in such a problem?\nHere, the question would be the following: how to transfer into, or rather what transpires\nwhen we transfer into the single Latin word presence the entire differentiated system of\nGreek and German words, the entire system of translation in which Heideggerian language\n(ousia. parousia, Gegenwartigkeit, Anwesen, Anwesenheit, Vorhandenheit, etc.) is produced?\nAnd all this taking into account that the two Greek words, and the words associated with\nthem, already have translations charged with history (essence, substance, etc.)? Above\nall, how to transfer into the single word presence, both too rich and too poor, the history\nof the Heideggerian text which associates or disjoins these concepts in subtle and regular\nfashion throughout an itinerary that covers more than forty years? How to translate into\nFrench [Englishi or translate French [English] into the play of these displacements? To take\nonly one example__but one which has a privileged status here\u2014\"The Anaximander Frag-\nment\" (1946) rigorously dissociates concepts which all signify presence, and which, in the\ntext of Being and Time that we have just cited, were aligned as synonyms, or in any case\nwithout pointing out any pertinent trait of difference. Let us cut out a page from \"The\nAnaximander Fragment.\" We will cite it in translation, inserting the German words which\nbear the burden of the difficulties even in places where the translator might not be obliged\nto do so: \"The first point we gather from this poetic phrase is that ta eonta is distinguished\nfrom ta essomena and pro eonta. Thus ta eonta designates being in the sense of the present\n(das Seiende im Sinne des Gegenwartigen). When we moderns speak of 'the present,' we either\nmean what is 'now' (das Jetzige)\u2014which we represent as something within time (etwas\n:nnerzeitiges), the 'now' serving as a phase in the stream of time\u2014or we bring the 'present'\ninto relation with the 'objective' (zum Gegenstandigen). As something objective (das Ob-\njective), an object is related to a representing subject. However, if we employ 'present' (das\n'gegernv\u00e4rtig') for the sake of a closer determination of eonta, then we must understand\n'the present' (das 'gegenwartig') from the essence (Wesen) of eonta and not vice versa. Yet\neonta is also what is past and what is to come. Both are ways of presencing (des Anwesenden),\ni.e. the presencing of what is not presently present (des ungegenw\u00e4rtig Anwesenden). The\nGreeks also named more precisely what is presently present (das gegenwartig Anwesende)\nIn pareonta, pam meaning 'alongside' (be:), in the sense of coming alongside in uncon-\ncealment (Unverborgenheit). The gegen in gegenu'\u00e4rtig (presently) does not mean something\nover against a subject, but rather an open expanse of unconcealment (die offene Gegend der\nUnverborgenheit), into which and within which whatever comes along lingers (das Beige-\nkommene vertt'eilt). Accordingly, as a characteristic of eonta, 'presently' (gegenwartig) means\nas much 'having arrived to linger awhile in the expanse of unconcealment.' Spoken first,\nand thus emphasized, eon Ia which is expressly distinguished from proeonta and essomena,\nnames for the Greeks what is present (das Anwesende) insofar as it has arrived in the\ndesignated sense, to linger within the expanse of unconcealment. Such a coming is proper\narnval, the presencing of what is properly present. (Solche Angekom:nenheit ist die eigentliche\n33\n"

Within-time-ness,\nintratemporality, is taken to be the homogenous medium in which the movement\nof daily existence is reckoned and organized. This homogeneity of the temporal\nmedium becomes the effect of a \"leveling off of primordial time\" (Nivellierung\nder ursprunglichen Zeit), and constitutes a world time more objective than the\nobject and more subjective than the subject. In affirming that history\u2014that is,\nspirit, which alone has a history\u2014falls into time (.\n.\n. f/lilt die Entwicklung der\nGeschichte in die Zeit),'\u00b0 is not Hegel thinking in terms of the vulgar concept of\ntime? Heidegger claims to be in agreement with Hegel on this proposition in its\n\"results\" (im Resultat), and to the extent that it concerns the temporality of Dasein\nand the co-belonging that links Dasein to world time (p. 457).\" But Heidegger\nagrees only with the proposition in its results, and Hegel himself has taught us\nthat results are nothing without their becoming, outside the locus which assigns\nto them an itinerary or a method. Now, Heidegger wants to show in what way\nhis project of fundamental ontology displaces the meaning of this result, thus\nthaking the Hegelian proposition appear as the \"most radical\" formulation of\nthe vulgar concept of time. He is concerned not with \"criticizing\" Hegel but\nwith sharpening the difference between fundamental ontology and classical or\nuse related to differance. See also the interview \"Semiology and Grammatology\" for a\ndiscussion of gramme as diff\u00e9rance. Grnmrn\u00eb is from Aristotle's Physics, a work cited exten-\nsively here. I have used the translation by R. P. Hardie and G. K. Gaye (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1930); all following references are to this edition.\n10.

We will have occasion to ask whether or not this agreement about the \"results,\"\nwhich keeps to a description of \"fallen temporality,\" engages Heidegger in something\nbeyond the limits that he seeks to mark here. Despite the reinterpretation to which he\nsubmits the Verfallen (for example at the end of section 82), it will be asked whether the\nsingle distinction\u2014whatever its restructuration and originality\u2014between proper and im-\nproper temporality, authentic, orginary and nonoriginary, etc., is not itself a tributary of\nHegelianism, of the idea of a \"fall\" into time. And, consequently, a tributary of the \"vulgar\"\nconcept of time.\n35\n"

It intervenes at the end of the subsection\ndevoted to the Hegelian exposition of the concept of time in the philosophy of\nnature and before the subsection of \"Hegel's Interpretation of the Connection\nbetween Time and Spirit.\" Let us follow its translation:\nThe priority which Hegel has given to the 'now' which has been levelled\noff, makes it plain that in defining the concept of time he is under the\nsway of the manner in which time is ordinarily understood; and this\nmeans that he is likewise under the sway of the traditional conception of\nit. It can even be shown that his conception of time has been drawn di-\nrectly from the 'physics' of Aristotle.\nIn the lena Logic (Cf. C. Lasson's 1923 edition), which was projected at\nthe time of Hegel's habilitation, the analysis of time which we find in his\nEncyclopedia has already been developed in all its essential parts. Even the\nroughest examination reveals that the section on time (pp. 202 ff.) is a\nparaphrase of Aristotle's essay on time.

Hegel discusses the concept of time in conjunction with defining\nthe concepts of aether and motion. Here too his analysis of space comes\nlater (nachgeordnet). Though the dialectic already emerges, it does not\nhave as yet the rigid schematic form which it will have afterward, but\nstill makes it possible to understand the phenomena in a fairly relaxed\nmanner. On the way from Kant to Hegel's developed system, the impact\nof the Aristotelian ontology and logic has again been decisive. The Fact of\nthis impact has long been well known. But the kind of effect it has had,\nthe path it has taken, even its limitations, have hitherto been as obscure\nas the Fact itself has been familiar. A concrete philosophical Interpretation\ncomparing Hegel's Jena Logic with the 'physics' and 'metaphysics' of Aris-\ntotle will bring new light. For the above considerations, some rough sug-\ngestions will suffice.\nAristotle sees the essence of time in the nun, Hegel in the 'now' (jetzt).\nAristotle takes the nun as oros; Hegel takes the 'now' as 'boundary'\n(Grenze). Aristotle understands the nun as Stigrne; Hegel interprets the\n'now' as a point. Aristotle describes the nun as lode Ii; Hegel calls the\n'now' the 'absolute this' (das 'absolute Dieses'). Aristotle follows tradition\nin connecting khronos with sphaira; Hegel stresses the 'circular course'\n(Kreislauf) of time. To be sure, Hegel escapes the central tendency of the\nAristotelian analysis\u2014the tendency to expose a foundational connection\n(akolouthein) between the nun, the oros, the stigrne and the tode ti.\nIn its result, Bergson's view is in accord with Hegel's thesis that space\n'is' time, in spite of the very different reasons they have given. Bergson\nmerely says the\nthat time (temps (in French in the text in order to\noppose tern ps, time, to dur\u00e9e, durationj) is space. Bergson's view of time\ntoo has obviously arisen from an Interpretation of the Aristotelian essay\non time. That a treatise of Bergson with the title Quid Aristoteles de loco\nsenserit should have appeared at the same time as his Essai sur les donn\u00e9es\nimm\u00e9diates de la conscience, where the problem of tern ps and dur\u00e9e is ex-\npounded, is not just a superficial literary connection. Having regard to\nAristotle's definition of time as the arithmos kin\u00ebseOs, Bergson prefaces his\nanalysis of time with an analysis of number. Time as space (Cf. Essai, p.\n69) is quantitative Succession. By a counter-orientation (Gegenorientierung)\nto this conception of time, duration gets described as a qualitative Succes-\nsion. This is not the place for coming to terms critically (Auseinanderset-\nzung) with Bergson's conception of time or with other Present-day views\nof it. So far as anything essential has been achieved in today's analyses\nwhich will take us beyond Aristotle and Kant, it pertains more to the\nway time is grasped and to our 'consciousness of time'.

By giving in to\nthe obvious, that time is, that time has as its essence, the nun, which is most\noften translated as instant, but which functions in Greek like our word \"now\"\n(inaintenant). The nun is the form from which time cannot ever depart, the form\nin which it cannot not be given; and yet the nun, in a certain sense, is not.

Time rel\u00e8ve [\"relifts\"]'5 space.\nIn recalling this development, Heidegger underlines that in this way space\nis only thought as time (p. 482). Space is time to the extent that space is determined\non the basis of the (first or last) negativity of the point. \"According to Hegel,\nthis negation of the negation as punctuality is time\" (p. 482). Time, therefore,\nis thought on the basis of, or looking toward, the point, and the point is thought\non the basis of, or looking toward, time. Point and time are thought in this\ncircularity which relates them one to the other.

Further, the auf- is related to negation-and-pres-\nervation in a higher sphere; the re- questions the metaphysics of negation, the theology\nimplicit in dialectical negation as a raising up.\n16.

It is that being\nwhich, inasmuch as it is, is not, and inasmuch as it is not, is: it is Becoming\ndirectly intuited (das angeschaute Werden); this means that differences, which\nadmittedly are purely momentary, i.e. directly self-sublating (unmittelbar sich\naufhebenden Unterschiede), are determined as external, i.e. as external to them-\nselves\" (p. 34).\nThis definition has at least three direct consequences in Hegel's text considered\nas a paraphrase of Aristotle.\n1. The Kantian concept of time is reproduced in it, or rather is deduced from\nit. The necessity of such a deduction would show, then, that the Kantian rev-\nolution did not displace what Aristotle had set down but, on the contrary, settled\ndown there itself, changing its locale and then refurbishing it. Further on we\nwill come to suggest this from another point of view. In effect, \"intuited becom-\ning\" in itself, without empirical sensory content, is the purely sensory, the formal\nsensory free from all sensuous matter, without whose discovery no Copernican\nrevolution would have taken place. What Kant discovered is the \"non-sensuous\nsensuous\" that here reproduces the \"paraphrase\" of Aristotle: \"Time, like space,\nis a pure form of sense or of intuition, the non-sensuous sensuous (das unsinnliche\nSinnliche)\" (Enc., sec. 258, Remark, p. 34). In alluding to this \"nonsensuously\nsensuous,\"17 Heidegger does not relate the Hegelian concept to its Kantian equiv-\nalent; it is well known that he considered Hegel to have covered over and erased\nKant's audaciousness in many respects. Are we not justified here, Heidegger\nnotwithstanding, in placing Kant in the direct line which, according to Heidegger,\nleads from Aristotle to Hegel?\n2. According to an elaboration which resembles that found in Kant and the\nProblem of Metaphysics (and consequently, Being and Time), Hegel concludes from\nhis definition:\na) \"Time is the same principle as the I = I of pure self-consciousness\" (ibid.).\nWe would have to relate\u2014although we cannot do so here\u2014the entire Remark\nof section 258 of the Encyclopedia, which demonstrates this last proposition, to\nsection 34 of Heidegger's Kant, particularly to the section on \"Time as Pure Self-\nAffection and the Temporal Character of the\nwhen he writes, for example\nare\nwith respect to movement .\n. .

Eternity is another name of the presence of the present.\nHegel also distinguishes this presence from the present as now. A distinction\nanalogous, but not identical, to the one proposed by Heidegger, because it calls\nupon the difference between the finite and the\nAn intra-ontic differ-\nence, Heidegger would say. And in effect this is where the entire question would\nhave to reside.\nWhat the Question Evades\nUntil now we have remained, in a way, within the first hypothesis of the Aris-\ntotelian aporetic, which began by paralyzing itself in the determination of time\nas nun and of nun as meros (part).\nOur question, then, is the following: in overturning the hypothesis, in dem-\nonstrating that the now is not a part of time, does Aristotle extract the problematic\nhere\n-\nbetw en the npw .(.Jetzl) and\nPure presence,irffinite parousia,\naccording to Hegel, then, would not be governed by the now which Heidegger tells us\nlimits and determines parousia from the Physics to the Encyclopedia. But, since Heidegger\nalso is questioning a privilege of the Gegenwart , here we ought to delve into the differences\nbetween Jetzt, Gegenwart, Anwesenheit. Again under the rubric of a preliminary survey, let\nus be satisfied, here, with translating Hegel's text: \"The dimensions of time, present (Ge-\nfuture, and past, are the becoming of externality as such, and the resolution\n(Auflosung) of it into the differences of being as passing over into nothing, and of nothing\nas passing over into being. The immediate vanishing of these differences into singularity\nis the present as Now (die Gegenwart als Jetzt) which, as singularity, is exclusive of the other\nmoments, and at the same time completely continues in them, and is only this vanishing\nof its being into nothing and of nothing into its being.\n\"The finite present (die endliche Gegenwart) is the Now as being and distinguished as the\nconcrete unity, and hence as the affirmative, from what is negative, from the abstract\nmoments of past and future; but this being is itself only abstract, vanishing into nothing.\nFurthermore, in Nature, where time is a Now, being does not reach the existence of the\ndifference of these dimensions; they are of necessity only in subjective imagination (Vor-\nstellung), in remembrance and fear and hope. But the past and future of time as being in\nNature are space, for space is negated time; just as sublated (aufgehobene) space is im-\nmediately the point, which developed for itself is time\" (Enc., sec. 259, p. 37). These\ntexts\u2014and several others\u2014seem both to confirm and to challenge the interpretation in\nBeing and Time. The confirmation is evident. The challenge complicates things at the point\nat which the present is distinguished from the now, at which the now, in its purity, belongs\nonly to nature and is not yet time, etc. In a word, it would be quite hasty and an over-\nsimplification to say that the Hegelian concept of time is borrowed from a \"physics\" or\nfrom a \"philosophy of nature,\" and that in this way it essentially passes unchanged into\na \"philosophy,of spirit\" or into a \"philosophy of history.\" Time is also this passage itself.\nThe reading of Aristotle already would raise analogous questions.\nEvery affirmation (here, Heidegger's) according to which a concept, in Hegel, belongs\nto the philosophy of nature (or, in general, to a determined, particular site of the Hegelian\ntext) a priori is of limited pertinence due to the relevant Icf. aufhebcnl structure of the\nrelations between nature and non-nature in speculative dialectics. Nature is outside spirit,\nbut as spirit itself, as the position of its proper being-outside-itself.\n46\n"

Is or is not time a part of onta?\n2. After the aporias relative to the properties which amount to time (pen ton\nhuparkhontan), it is asked what time is, and what its physis might be (ti d'estin ho\nkhronos kai tis autou he physis). The manner in which the first question is for-\nmulated indeed shows that the Being of time has been anticipated on the basis\nof the now, and of the now as part. And this occurs at the moment when\nAristotle seems to overturn the first hypothesis and to contend instead that the\nnow is not a part, or that time is not composed of nows (to de nun ou meros\n\u2022\n. . ho de khronos ou dokei sungkeisfhai ek tOn nun\u2014218a).\nThis second series of propositions belongs to an elaboration of the common-\nsense hypotheses whereby time may be thought of as not belonging to beings,\nor to beingness (ousia) in any pure and simple fashion. These initial exoteric\nhypotheses never will be put into question at another level, a nonexoteric\nHaving recalled why it may be thought that time is not a being, Aristotle leaves\nthe question in suspense. From here on the physis of that whose belonging to\nbeing still remains undecidable will be examined.

This is the difference, in Physics IV, between the treatise on place and the treatise\non time. Only the former adds a critical elaboration to the exotenc elaboration and expli-\ncates its articulation (210b).\n24. J.
