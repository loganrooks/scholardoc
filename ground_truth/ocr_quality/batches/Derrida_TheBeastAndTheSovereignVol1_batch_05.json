How does one recognize a haunting? With \nwhat signs? Positive, negative? Denegative? Presence of symptoms? Ab-\nsence of symptoms? Explicit or implicit thematization? To what extent, \netc.? (Read and comment)\nCowardice, cruelty, baseness, b\u00ea tise are not simply bodily powers or facts \nof character or society, but structures of thought as such. The landscape \nof the transcendental livens up: we must put into it the place of the tyrant, \nthe slave and the imbecile \u2014 without the place resembling the one who oc-\ncupies it, and without the transcendental ever being transferred onto the \nempirical \ufb01 gures that it makes possible. What prevents one from making \nb\u00ea tise into a transcendental problem is always our belief in the postulates \nof the Cogitatio: b\u00ea tise can no longer be other than an empirical determina-\ntion, referring to psychology or the anecdotal \u2014 worse still, to polemics and \ninsults \u2014 and to sottisiers as a particularly execrable pseudoliterary genre. \nBut whose fault is it? Is the fault not \ufb01 rst of all that of philosophy, which \nallowed itself to be convinced by the concept of error, even if it borrows that \nconcept itself from facts, but from not very meaningful and highly arbitrary \nfacts? The worst literature makes sottisiers: but the best was haunted by the \nproblem of b\u00ea tise, which it managed to bring to the gates of philosophy, by \ngiving it its full cosmic, encyclopedic, and gnoseological dimension (Flau-\nbert, Baudelaire, Bloy). It would have suf\ufb01 ced that philosophy take up this \nproblem [of b\u00ea tise] again with its own means and with all necessary mod-\nesty, considering that b\u00ea tise is never that of the other, but the object of a \nproperly transcendental question: how is b\u00ea tise (and not error) possible?31\nB. On the other hand, saying that b\u00ea tise is never that of someone else does \nnot only mean that it is always reserved for my fellow as a human being. \nIt also means that \u201cI,\u201d \u201cmyself,\u201d as philosopher, theorist or not, always run \nthe risk of having to attribute to myself the b\u00ea tise I\u2019m talking about or that, \ndogmatically, b\u00eatement, I think I recognize in others.

But this track may gradually lead us toward places that are no \nlonger exactly those of Deleuze.\nAs to the b\u00ea tise that can always be mine, and not that of someone else, \nand which, like the category of accusation, can always betray my fault, my \nfailing, evil, or illness, the defect from which I suffer, well, it would \ufb01 rst be \nnecessary to take into account, perhaps, a kind of contagion of b\u00ea tise, a mi-\nmeticism of b\u00ea tise, which should make us wonder where it comes from and \nwhich engenders b\u00ea tise in the very gaze, in the sustained attention, study, \nor re\ufb02 ection, the very knowledge we devote to b\u00ea tise: as though speaking \nof \u201cthe\u201d b\u00ea tise, claiming to know its essence and its meaning, assuming that \nthere is something like \u201cthe\u201d b\u00ea tise, is already a sign of b\u00ea tise. And then, to \nspeak of contagion is to recognize \u2014 a very important point \u2014 that one is \nnever b\u00eate all on one\u2019s own and by oneself, that b\u00ea tise, b\u00ea tises in the plural, if \nsuch there be, are from the start phenomena of  being- with or, if you prefer, \nof the community, intersubjectivity, Mitsein, the socius, as you will. There \nhave to be several of you at it. You have to speak or, if like me you have \ndoubts about the authority of human speech in this domain as in others, let\u2019s \nsay: there has to be some trace. One is never b\u00eate on one\u2019s own, that\u2019s how it \nis, even if this excuses or exonerates nobody. Flaubert doesn\u2019t say it this way, \nbut it seems to me he allows us to think it, at the very point of symptom that \nhe admits to, when he writes the following (it is a passage from the Nota \nBene to Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet that I quote in an old article on Flaubert, \u201cUne \nid\u00e9e de Flaubert,\u201d32 in which I approach in my own way this problem of \nthe relations between b\u00ea tise and philosophy): [Flaubert, then, writes the fol-\nlowing:] \u201cBouvard and P\u00e9cuchet \ufb01 ll me up to the point that I have become \nthem!

B\u00ea tise becomes their thing.\nLet us never forget that all this is said in French and that all the \u201creal\u201d \nproblems are waiting for us at this turn.

And \nthis is what Flaubert suggests when he writes the following in two letters \nthat I quote (p. 315 [p. 427] of Psych\u00e9), and you will see in them, for once, \nanimals named in the same breath as b\u00ea tise. This time,  becoming- b\u00eate is also \na  becoming- animal, but also, as you are going to hear, a  becoming- mineral, \nstony, immune from attack, impassive, invulnerable, a  becoming- thing, a \n becoming- what, like stone or a granite monument.\nTwo letters then: 1. \u201cB\u00ea tise is something unshakable: nothing can at-\ntack it without breaking against it. It is of the nature of granite, hard and \nresistant.\u201d And the signi\ufb01 cant example that Flaubert immediately gives is \nprecisely not the name of the work but the name of the author, the signa-\ntory of the work thus b\u00eati\ufb01 ed in his monument, in his monumentalization, \nbetween the what and the who, in the equivocal  becoming- what of the who \nstill a who, between man, animal, and earth, between the living thing and \nthe lifeless thing:\nB\u00ea tise is something unshakable: nothing can attack it without breaking \nagainst it. It is of the nature of granite, hard and resistant. In Alexandria, \na certain Thompson, from Sunderland, has written his name in letters six \nfeet tall on the Pompey column [. . .] There is no way of seeing the column \nwithout seeing the name of Thompson and consequently without thinking \nof Thompson.

These reasons, which are heterogeneous \namong themselves, these many reasons, do not only concern the relation of \nsigni\ufb01 cations (signi\ufb01 ed or signifying) between languages: they do not only \nhave to do with the fact that it is only in French that the irreducible diffrac-\ntion of all these meanings and all these values of b\u00eate and b\u00ea tise retains an \nat least implicit reference to the animal b\u00eate, a reference one \ufb01 nds nowhere \nelse, that I know of, in the same way.

Why does the question of the b\u00eate so regularly call for fabulous \nresponses and \u201cas if\u201d concepts, quasi- concepts?

His error? No, \nsomething else, more and something other than his error, when he not only \njoined the Nazi party (he remained a member until the end) but assumed \nhis commitment to Nazism in 1933\u201334.

Let me read a long extract from \nAvital Ronell.\nFor the ancient Greeks, stupidity cannot be seen as belonging to the domain \nof the political because it indicates that which lacks politics: it is being- \noutside- the political. In terms of a political anthropology, the Greek ap-\nproximation or anticipation of stupidity would have to be located in the \nprepolitical, in the forgetting of politics.

Dummheit \nretranslated into Greek means a suspension of the political at the very mo-\nment when Heidegger offers one of his minimalist utterances concerning \nhis link to the politics of the Third Reich.\n \nAt this point, it would be prudent to introduce the problem of untrans-\nlatability that will dominate the pages to follow. There was already an inter-\nnal \ufb01 ssuring within the Greek approximations of \u201cstupidity\u201d \u2014 a linguistic \ninstability that could be overcome only by means of considerable rhetori-\ncal violence. On another register, the movement between French, German, \nSpanish, and En glish appropriations of \u201cstupidity\u201d reveals more than the \nmatter of semantic variance. \u201cStupidity\u201d resists transfer into Dumm heit, just \nas it can hardly inhabit the premises of b\u00ea tise, with its attendant zoology, the \nanimals or animality that populate the few but noteworthy discussions of \nstupidity in French.

And here the matter of untranslatability becomes \neven more tricky, if equally fundamental. What would happen if we were \nto translate this avowal of Dummheit according to common usage, as \u201cstu-\npidity\u201d? Would another translation, equally acceptable though less com-\nmon, alter the horizon of meaning? Let us say that Heidegger referred to \nhis \u201cdumbness\u201d of 1934 rather than to his \u201cstupidity.\u201d The date remains the \nsame, but the moral meaning has shifted, taking on another value. This in-\ntralinguistic twister repeats the interlinguistic knot tying up \u201cstupid\u201d with \nb\u00eate. The difference between avowing stupidity and claiming dumbness for \noneself (\u201cThat was dumb\u201d; \u201cI was really dumb in 1934\u201d) is a signi\ufb01 cant one. \nWhile the disclosure of dumbness leaves no recourse or room for argument, \nstupidity is linked to an effect of malice; indeed, it calls for judgment. In \nother words, whereas dumbness might be part of the irreparable facticity of \nexistence, there is an ethics of stupidity, or let us say simply that it calls for \nan ethics.

There is a point of untranslatability, and there is not [ne . . . point] \nuntranslatability. What links the meaning and the syntax in the French us-\nage of the word point is untranslatable, but relatively untranslatable. The \nresponse is always economical, i.e. impure. Point is untranslatable by one \nword when its syntax plays between the point and the negation ne . . . pas, \nbut easily translatable if I devote a page of explanation to it, and then it will \nnot be purely and simply a translation.\nTo sharpen up this question, one must \ufb01 rst bear witness to or take stock \nof the fact that the absence of a general equivalent, namely a univocal con-\n13.

For example, the number, I repeat, the number 2, the objective \nnumber, beyond any language, is an absolutely ideal object, universally in-\ntelligible, and so free, detached, unbound, but the words deux, two, zwei \nare the same only each in its own language: they remain the \u201csame\u201d object \nintended in each language as often as whoever repeats them: but as they \nremain bound to a language, not universal, they are bound, enchained ide-\nalities relatively limited in their ideality or in their process of idealization \nor universalization. Well, the meaning of the words b\u00eate, b\u00ea tise, as mean-\nings of French words, have an ideal meaning, but one bound to the French \nlanguage, and so to French history, culture, and society, and thereby in the \nend, more seriously, always bound to determinate uses and contexts which \nto that extent limit their translatability or universalization, not only from \none language to another but within one language.\nI choose phenomenological vocabulary and Husserlian conceptuality \nto describe this situation because one \ufb01 nds in it this motif of freedom and \ntherefore the correlate of that responsible, free, and sovereign personality \nthat is so often implied to explain to us (for example, as Lacan and Deleuze \ndo close to us, but as has always been done) that cruel bestiality and b\u00ea tise are \nproper to man and cannot be attributed to so- called animal beasts. At bot-\ntom, what Lacan and Deleuze are telling us about bestiality and (transcen-\ndental) b\u00ea tise is that they are reserved for mankind, that they are the proper \nof mankind, that the beasts are incapable of them, that one cannot qualify \nas \u201cbestial\u201d or b\u00eate (b\u00eate in the sense of b\u00ea tise) beasts that have no relation to \nthe law, that they cannot be cruel and responsible, i.e. free and sovereign \n(sovereignty being, even before de\ufb01 ning politically the essence or vocation \nor claim of a sovereign of a  nation- state or a people, the very de\ufb01 nition of \nthe juridical person, as a free and responsible person, able to say or imply \u201cI, \nme,\u201d to posit itself as \u201cI, me\u201d).\nIf, then, the very meaning of the lexicon of b\u00ea tise or  being- b\u00eate, of bestiality \nor b\u00ea tise, cannot be absolutely translatable, as a free ideality without equivo-\ncation, as a semantic object that is pure and independent not only of such \nand such a language but of pragmatic, performative, polemical, or strategic \nand violent contexts, then it seems impossible strictly to reserve them to \nman as sovereign and free.

If meaning remains linked to a determinate situation, a war-\nlike or polemical pragmatics, for example, an engagement and a vital in-\nvestment (of whatever nature: libidinal, hunting, or seductive), to a relation \nof forces, then the distinction between reaction and response (that everyone \nfrom Descartes to Lacan makes the criterion of what is proper to man, of \nhis rationality, freedom, sovereignty, relation to the law) \u2014 this distinction \nloses its rigor and decidability.\nThis is why, without concluding that b\u00ea tise is proper to French, even if \nthe word b\u00ea tise belongs only to the French language (but why, in fact?), I \nalso recalled that we should start out again from the famous statement in \na very French work of our time, Val\u00e9ry\u2019s Monsieur Teste.

Un-\nless one supposes, with Descartes and Kant, not only that the animal cannot \nconstitute itself into an I and a Me, but that anthropology, the essence of \nwhat is proper to man, is circumscribed by the possibility of the \u201cI, Me,\u201d or \neven by the ability to say \u201cMe, I.\u201d That is a question I shall take on immedi-\nately after this. Here is what Deleuze says: (Read and comment)\nNow animals are as it were forearmed against this ground by their explicit \nforms. It is not the same for the I and the Me, undermined by the \ufb01 elds \nof individuation that work on them, defenseless against a rising up of the \nground that holds out to them a distorted or distorting mirror, in which \nall forms, now thought, dissolve. B\u00ea tise is neither the ground nor the indi-\nvidual, but rather this relation in which individuation makes the ground \nrise up without being able to give it form (it rises though the I, penetrating \nto the depths of the possibility of thought, constituting the unrecognized of \nall recognition).16\nThis is to recognize that b\u00ea tise is a thing of the \u201cMe\u201d or the \u201cI,\u201d and is not \nto name something like a form of psychic life (whether one call it ground \nor not) that would not have the \ufb01 gure of \u201cI Me.\u201d Now, without needing to \ngive credit to this or that construction of Freudian metapsychology, one \ncan avoid reducing the whole of psychic or phenomenological experience \nto its egological form, and one can avoid reducing all life of the Ego, all \negological structure, to the conscious self. In psychic or phenomenological \nexperience, in the self- relation of the living being, there is some non- ego, on \nthe one hand, and there is even, Freud would say, some of the Ego that is \nunconscious. If one does not wish to invoke Freud\u2019s authority and discur-\nsivity, it suf\ufb01 ces to admit that the living being is divisible and constituted by \na multiplicity of agencies, forces. and intensities that are sometimes in ten-\nsion or even in contradiction. I am deliberately, in speaking of a differential \nof intensities and forces, using a  Nietzschean- style language more accept-\nable to Deleuze. But you see clearly what is at stake around this ego- logics \nof \u201cI\u201d and \u201cMe.\u201d\nGiven this, not to forget our problem of the beast and the sovereign, if \nthe sovereign is always the agency or a \u201cMe I,\u201d of a subject saying \u201cMe I,\u201d or \n16.

And in these antagonisms made possible, in every \ufb01 nite living \nbeing, by differences of force or intensity, b\u00ea tise is always necessarily on both \nsides, the side of the \u201cwho\u201d and the side of the \u201cwhat,\u201d on the side of the one \nthat manages to posit itself as sovereign, and on the side of what the sover-\neign denounces or attacks as the b\u00ea tise of the other.\nEven if it were saying, sovereignly intelligent, something as stupid as \u201cLa \nb\u00ea tise n\u2019est pas mon fort\u201d \u2014 which has always passed, in French literature, \nuntil now, until this evening, for a supreme manifestation of critical intel-\nligence positing itself and proudly claiming its rights, of the pitiless lucidity \nof the cogito, of a hyperconscious and triumphant intellectualism, whereas \nfor my part I hear in it, perhaps, perhaps another b\u00ea tise, the b\u00ea tise of the self \n[moi], the b\u00ea tise of the self itself, of the conscious self- positing self, b\u00ea tise \nas such, my very b\u00ea tise. Which posits itself, still triumphant, as intelligent, \nwhich is nothing other than the self- con\ufb01 dence and the self- consciousness \nof a vigilance that is non- b\u00eate, not so b\u00eate, inasmuch as it posits itself as such, \ninasmuch as it posits and posits itself, and \ufb01 nds itself. Positing, thesis, the \nthesis of self, the triumph of self- positing, re\ufb02 ects and re\ufb02 ects itself as b\u00ea-\ntise. B\u00ea tise always triumphs, it is always, in the war we are talking about, on \nthe side of the victor. There is a certain Triumph of Life in b\u00ea tise. A certain \ntriumph over which a certain life tries also to triumph. This is why it is \nvital for b\u00ea tise not to \ufb01 nd itself b\u00eate: that would be suicidal.

Each says, both say to each \nother, one is more b\u00eate than the other. Disaster and triumph. One is stronger \nthan the other. Therefore one is weaker than the other.\nThis undecidable alternative, both \u201cstrange and familiar,\u201d uncanny, un-\nheimlich, would go just as well for life and death, the living and the dead, \nthe organic and the inorganic, the living being and the machine, the living \nbeing and its mechanization, the marionette, the mortal and the immortal: \none is always more b\u00eate than the other. The truth of b\u00ea tise is no doubt this \nreciprocal upping of the ante, this denying hyperbole that always adds b\u00ea-\ntise, a supplement of b\u00ea tise, to the self- proclamation of its opposite.\nNext time, we shall probably set off again from the marionette. Not only \nthat of Monsieur Teste, who, among other declarations that we shall read, \nis supposed to have \u201ckilled the marionette,\u201d perhaps in order to deny or kill \nwithin him the undecidable internal strangeness, both intestinal and radi-\ncally other, vertiginous, unheimlich, in order to resist, repress, or master a \ncertain Unheimlichkeit (\u201cWhen he spoke, he never raised an arm or a \ufb01 nger: \nhe had killed the marionette [these last three words in italics: how can one kill \n18.
