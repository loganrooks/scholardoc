Madness, theme or index: what is signi\ufb01cant is that Descartes, at bot-\ntom, never speaks of madness itself in this text. Madness is not his\ntheme. He treats it as the index of a question of principle, that is, of\nepistemological value. It will be said, perhaps, that this is the sign of a\nprofound exclusion. But this silence on madness itself simultaneously\nsigni\ufb01es the opposite of an exclusion, since it is not a question of\nmadness in this text, if only to exclude it. It is not in the Meditations that\nDescartes speaks of madness itself.\n16. To underline this vulnerability and touch on the greatest dif\ufb01culty, we\nwould have to specify that the expressions \u201csensory or corporeal fault\u201d\nor \u201ccorporeal error\u201d could have no meaning for Descartes. There is no\ncorporeal error, particularly in illness: jaundice or melancholy are only\nthe occasions of an error that itself is born only with the consent or\naf\ufb01rmation of the will in judgment, when \u201cone who is ill with jaundice\njudges everything to be yellow because his eye is tinged with yellow. So\n\ufb01nally, too, when the imagination is diseased, as in cases of melan-\ncholia, and a man thinks that his own disorderly fancies represent real\nthings\u201d (Rule XII. Descartes emphasizes this point: the most\nabnormal sensory or imaginative experience, considered in and of\nitself, at its own level and at its proper moment, never deceives us; or\nnever deceives understanding, \u201cif it restrict its attention accurately to\nthe object presented to it, just as it is given to it either \ufb01rsthand or by\nmeans of an image; and if it moreover refrain from judging that the\nimagination faithfully reports the objects of the senses, or that the\nsenses take on the true forms of things, or in \ufb01ne that external things\nalways are as they appear to be\u201d [Haldane and Ross, p. 44].)\n17.

Haldane and Ross, p. 148.\n20. Ibid. It is a question here of the order of reasons, as it is followed in the\nMeditations.

Like Leibniz, Descartes has con\ufb01dence in \u201cscienti\ufb01c\u201d or \u201cphilo-\nsophical\u201d language, which is not necessarily the language taught in\nnotes to pages 56\u201365\n392\n"

After desiring to restore the properly ontological intention dormant\nwithin metaphysics, after having reawakened the \u201cfundamental ontol-\nogy\u201d beneath \u201cmetaphysical ontology,\u201d Heidegger, faced by the ten-\nacity of traditional ambiguity, \ufb01nally proposes to abandon the terms\n\u201contology\u201d and \u201contological\u201d (Introduction to Metaphysics). The ques-\ntion of Being cannot be submitted to an ontology.\n4. That is, to relativism: the truth of philosophy does not depend upon its\nrelation to the actuality of the Greek or European event. On the con-\ntrary, we must gain access to the Greek or European eidos through an\nirruption or a call whose point of departure is variously determined by\nHusserl and Heidegger. It remains that, for both, \u201cthe irruption of\nphilosophy\u201d (\u201cAufbruch oder Einbruch der Philosophie,\u201d Husserl, Kri-\nsis . . .) is the \u201coriginal\u201d phenomenon which characterizes Europe as a\n\u201cspiritual \ufb01gure\u201d (ibid.). For both, the \u201cword philosophia tells us that\nphilosophy is something which, \ufb01rst of all, determines the existence of\nthe Greek world. Not only that\u2014philosophia also determines the\ninnermost basic feature of our Western-European history, the often\nheard expression \u2018Western-European philosophy\u2019 is, in truth, a tautol-\nogy. Why? Because philosophy is Greek in its nature; Greek, in this\ninstance, means that in origin the nature of philosophy is of such a\nkind that it \ufb01rst appropriated the Greek world, and only it, in order to\nunfold.\u201d Heidegger, What Is Philosophy?, trans.

There follows a description of the preobjective\nsphere of an intentional experience absolutely departing from itself\ntoward the other (a description, however, which has never seemed to\nus to exceed certain Husserlian literality).

A proposition that Husserl doubtless would not have accepted easily.\nSimilarly, does the entire analysis devoted to the doxical thesis and to\nparagraph 117 of Ideas (Theory of Intuition, p. 192) take into account\nthe extraordinary enlargement of the notions of thesis and doxa\neffected by Husserl, who is already showing such care in respecting\nthe originality of the practical, the axiological, and the aesthetic? As for\nthe meaning of the reduction, it is true that in 1930, and in his pub-\nlished works, Husserl had not yet made it into a theme. We will come\nback to this. For the moment we are not interested in Husserlian truth,\nbut in Levinas\u2019s itinerary.\n16. As concerns representation, an important motif in the divergence, as\nconcerns its dignity and status in Husserlian phenomenology, Levinas,\nhowever, never seems to have stopped hesitating. But again, almost\nalways, it is a hesitation between the spirit and the letter. Sometimes\ntoo between law and fact. This movement can be followed through the\nfollowing passages: THI, pp. 90ff.; EDE, pp. 22\u201323, esp. p. 52; La tech-\nnique ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologique, pp. 98\u201399; TI, pp. 95ff.\n17. In EDE, at a time (1940\u201349) when the surprises in this area were no\nlonger held in store, the theme of this criticism still will be central: \u201cIn\nHusserl the phenomenon of meaning has never been determined by\nhistory.\u201d (We do not mean to say, here, that this sentence is \ufb01nally in\ncontradiction with Husserl\u2019s then known intentions. But are not the\nlatter, whatever the de\ufb01nitive heart of the matter, already more prob-\nlematical than Levinas seems to believe?)\n18. TN.

This confrontation is called for\nnot only because of the ethical themes but also because of the differ-\nence between totality and in\ufb01nity, about which Kant, among others\nand perhaps more than others, had a number of thoughts.\n27. Levinas often makes accusations against the Socratic mastery which\nteaches nothing, teaches only the already known, and makes every-\nthing arise from the self, that is from the Ego, or from the Same as\nMemory. Anamnesis too, would be a procession of the Same. On this\npoint, at least, Levinas cannot oppose himself to Kierkegaard (cf., for\nexample, J. Wahl, Etudes Kierkegaardiennes, pp. 308\u20139), for his critique\nof Platonism here is literally Kierkegaardian. It is true that Kierkegaard\nopposed Socrates to Plato each time that reminiscence was in ques-\ntion. The latter would belong to the Platonic \u201cspeculation\u201d from which\nSocrates \u201cseparates\u201d himself (Post scriptum).\n28. G. W. F. Hegel. The Philosophy of Fine Art, trans. F. P. B.

Here we are thinking of the distinction between discourse and vio-\nlence particularly common to Levinas and to Eric Weil. It does not have\nthe same meaning for both. Levinas notes this in passing and, while\npaying homage to Weil for his \u201csystematic and vigorous use of the\nterm violence in its opposition to discourse,\u201d claims to give \u201cdifferent\nmeaning\u201d to this distinction (DL). We would be tempted to give a\ndiametrically opposed meaning. The discourse which Weil acknow-\nledges as nonviolent is ontology, the project of ontology. (Cf. Logique\nde la philosophie, e.g., pp. 28ff. \u201cLa naissance de l\u2019ontologie, le dis-\ncours.\u201d) \u201cHarmony between men will be established by itself if men\nare not concerned with themselves, but with what is;\u201d its polarity is\nin\ufb01nite coherence, and its style, at least, is Hegelian. This coherence in\nontology is violence itself for Levinas: the \u201cend of history\u201d is not abso-\nlute Logic, the absolute coherence of the Logos with itself in itself; nor\nis it harmony in the absolute System, but Peace in separation, the\ndiaspora of absolutes. Inversely, is not peaceful discourse, according\nto Levinas, the discourse which respects separation and rejects the\nhorizon of ontological coherence, violence itself for Weil? Let us\nschematize: according to Weil, violence will be, or rather would be,\nreduced only with the reduction of alterity, or the will to alterity. The\nreverse is true for Levinas. But for Levinas coherence is always \ufb01nite\n(totality, in the meaning he gives to the word, rejecting any possible\nmeaning for the notion of in\ufb01nite totality). For Weil, it is the notion of\nalterity, on the contrary, which implies irreducible \ufb01nitude. But for\nboth, only the in\ufb01nite is nonviolent, and it can be announced only in\ndiscourse. One should examine the common presuppositions of this\nconvergence and divergence. One should ask whether the pre-\ndetermination, common to these two systems, of violation and of pure\nlogos, and, above all, the predetermination of their incompatability,\nrefers to an absolute truth, or perhaps to an epoch of the history of\nthought, the history of Being. Let us note that Bataille too, in Eroticism,\ndraws inspiration from Weil\u2019s concepts, and states this explicitly.\n43. TN. Derrida is playing on the double sense of regard as ethical concern\nand as objectifying glance. Cf. note 10 above.\n44. At bottom, it is the very notion of a \u201cconstitution of an alter ego\u201d to\nwhich Levinas refuses any merit. He would probably say, with Sartre,\n\u201cOne encounters the Other, one does not constitute it\u201d (Being and\nnotes to pages 136\u201354 403\n"

It goes without saying that constitution creates,\nconstructs, engenders, nothing: neither existence, nor the fact, which\nis evident, nor even meaning, which is less evident but equally certain,\nprovided that one takes some patient precautions, and provided that\none distinguishes the moments of passivity and activity within intu-\nition, in Husserl\u2019s sense, and the moment in which the distinction\nbecomes impossible. That is, in which the entire problematic oppos-\ning \u201cencounter\u201d to \u201cconstitution\u201d is no longer meaningful, or has only\na derivative and dependent meaning. Unable to enter into these dif-\n\ufb01culties here, let us simply recall this warning of Husserl\u2019s, among so\nmany others: \u201cHere too, as concerns the alter ego, the \u2018constitution of\nconsciousness\u2019 (Bewusstseinleistung) does not mean that I invent\n(er\ufb01nde) and that I make (mache) this supreme transcendence.\u201d (In\nquestion is God.)\nInversely, does not the notion of encounter\u2014a notion to which one\nmust refer, if one rejects all constitution, in the Husserlian sense of the\nterm\u2014aside from being prey to empiricism, let it be understood that\nthere is a time and an experience without \u201cother\u201d before the\nencounter?

The same is\nnot a category, but the possibility of every category. Here, we should\nattentively compare Levinas\u2019s theses with Heidegger\u2019s text entitled\nIdentity and Difference (1957). For Levinas, the same is the concept,\njust as Being and unity are concepts, and these three concepts\nimmediately communicate among each other (cf. TI p. 274, for\nexample).

In effect, if the Heideggerean concept of Endlichkeit was\nnever the Christian-theological concept of \ufb01nitude, it nevertheless\nremains that the idea of \ufb01nite Being is in itself ontologically theological\nand, as such, is incapable of satisfying a thought which draws back\nfrom Metaphysics only to meditate, in the light of the forgotten truth\nof Being, the still hidden unity of its onto-theological essence\u201d (Revue\ninternationale de philosophie, 1960, no. 52). A thought which seeks to\ngo to its very end in its language, to the end of what it envisages under\nthe name of original \ufb01nitude or \ufb01nitude of Being, therefore should\nabandon not only the words and themes of the \ufb01nite and the in\ufb01nite,\nbut also, which is doubtless impossible, everything that they govern in\nlanguage, in the deepest sense of the word. This last impossibility\ndoes not signify that the beyond of metaphysics is impracticable; on\nthe contrary, it con\ufb01rms the necessity for this incommensurable over-\n\ufb02ow to take support from metaphysics.

The \u201creaction\u201d\nagainst technology would not have as its target the danger of technical\ndepersonalization, but precisely that which liberates from ravishment\nby the Sacred and implantation in the Site.\n80. Since we cannot unfold this debate here, we will refer to the clearest of\nHeidegger\u2019s texts on this point: (a) Sein und Zeit: the themes of essen-\ntial Unheimlichkeit, of the \u201cnudity\u201d of being-in-the-world, \u201cals Un-\nzuhause.\u201d It is precisely this authentic condition that the neutral exist-\nence of the One \ufb02ees from. (b) Humanismus: concerning H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s\npoem Return, Heidegger notes that in his commentary the word\n\u201ccountry\u201d is \u201cthought in an essential sense, not at all a patriotic sense,\nnor a nationalist sense, but rather, from the point of view of the\nHistory of Being.\u201d (c) In the same location, Heidegger writes in part-\nicular: \u201cOn the metaphysical plane, every nationalism is an anthropolo-\ngism, and as such, a subjectivism. Nationalism is not overcome by\npure internationalism, but is rather enlarged and Set up as a system.\u201d\n(d) Finally, as concerns the dwelling and the home (whose praises\nLevinas also understands himself to sing, but, it is true, as a moment\nof interiority, and precisely as economy), Heidegger indeed speci\ufb01es\nthat the home does not metaphorically determine Being on the basis\nof its economy but, on the contrary, can only be determined as such on\nthe basis of the essence of Being. Cf. also . . . L\u2019homme habite en po\u00e8te,\nin which, let us note in passing, Heidegger distinguishes the Same\nand the Equal (das Selbe\u2014das Gleiche): \u201cThe Same sets to one side any\nhaste to resolve differences in the Equal,\u201d in Essais et conf\u00e9rences.\n81.

Theology, the thinking of the existent-\nGod, of the essence and existence of God, thus would suppose the\nthinking of Being. Here we need not refer to Heidegger in order to\nunderstand this movement, but \ufb01rst to Duns Scotus, to whom\nHeidegger had devoted one of his \ufb01rst writings, as is well known. For\nDuns Scotus, the thought of common and uniform Being is necessar-\nily prior to the thought of the determined existent (determined, for\nexample, as \ufb01nite or in\ufb01nite, created or uncreated, etc.). Which does\nnot mean:\nFirst, that common and uniform Being is a genre, and that Duns\nScotus revives the Aristotelian demonstration without nevertheless\nnotes to pages 181\u201382 409\n"

The problem which presents itself to\nScotus\u2014and which is the one which occupies us here, in the dialogue\nbetween Levinas and Heidegger\u2014\u201cis therefore posed on a terrain,\u201d\nwrites Gilson, \u201cwhich is no longer Aristotle\u2019s nor Aquinas\u2019s, because in\norder to penetrate it, one must \ufb01rst have emerged from the dilemma\nimposed by Aristotelianism between the universal and the singular,\nthe \u2018\ufb01rst\u2019 and the \u2018second,\u2019 and thereby have escaped the necessity of\nchoosing between the analogous and the uniform, which can only be\naccomplished by isolating a notion of Being in some way metaphysic-\nally pure of all determination\u201d (ibid., p. 89). It follows that if the\nthought of Being (which Gilson, differing from Heidegger, here calls\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d) is implied in all theology, it does not precede it, or\ngovern it in any way, as would a principle or a concept. The relations of\n\u201c\ufb01rst\u201d and \u201csecond,\u201d etc., have no meaning here.\n85. Sartre, like Levinas, had earlier interpreted the Mitsein in the sense of\ncamaraderie, the team, etc. Here, we refer to Being and Time. Cf. also,\nLe concept du monde chez Heidegger. In this work, Walter Biemel, with\nmuch precision and clarity, confronts this interpretation with\nHeidegger\u2019s intentions (pp. 90ff). Let us add simply that the with of\nthe Mitsein originally no more denotes the structure of a team ani-\nmated by a neutral common task than does the with of the \u201clanguage\nwith God\u201d (TI). The Being which can interpellate the Mitsein is not, as\nLevinas often gives us to understand, a third term, a common truth,\netc. Finally, the notion of Mitsein describes an original structure of the\nrelationship between Da-Sein and Da-Sein which is prior to every\nmeaning of \u201cencounter\u201d or of \u201cconstitution,\u201d that is, to the debate\nwhich we mentioned above.

We must specify here, that \u201contology\u201d does not refer to the concept of\nontology which Heidegger proposes to renounce (cf. above [note 4]),\nbut to the un\ufb01ndable expression by which it must be replaced. The\nword \u201chistorical\u201d also must be modi\ufb01ed in order to be understood in\nconsonance with the word \u201contological,\u201d of which it is not an attribute,\nand in relation to which it marks no derivation.\nnotes to pages 182\u201386\n410\n"

N\u00e9her (Cahiers de l\u2019Institut de science \u00e9conomique appliqu\u00e9,\n1959, is the only important text devoted to Rosenzweig, better known\nin France as the author of Hegel und der Staat than of Der Stern der\nErl\u00f6sung (The Star of Redemption, 1921). Rosenzweig\u2019s in\ufb02uence on\nLevinas seems to have been profound. \u201cWe were impressed by the\nopposition to the idea of totality in Franz Rosenzweig\u2019s Stern der Erl-\n\u00f6sung, a work too often present in this book to be cited\u201d TI, p. 28.\n90. In his Exposition of Philosophical Empiricism Schelling wrote: \u201cThus God\nwould be Being enclosed in itself in an absolute manner, would be\nsubstance in the most elevated sense, free of every relation. But from\nthe very fact that we consider these determinations as purely imma-\nnent, as relating to nothing external, one \ufb01nds oneself in the necessity\nof having to conceive them by parting from Him, that is, to conceive\nhim as the prius, that is as the absolute prius. And it is thus that,\npushed to its \ufb01nal consequences, empiricism leads us to the supra-\nempirical.\u201d Naturally, by \u201cenclosed\u201d and \u201cenfolded\u201d one is not to\nunderstand \ufb01nite closure and egoistic muteness, but rather absolute\nalterity, what Levinas calls the In\ufb01nite absolved of relation. An analo-\ngous movement is outlined in Bergson, who, in his Introduction to\nMetaphysics, criticizes the empiricist doctrines unfaithful to pure\nexperience in the name of true empiricism, and concludes: \u201cThis true\nempiricism is the true metaphysics.\u201d\n91. Pure difference is not absolutely different (from nondifference).\nHegel\u2019s critique of the concept of pure difference is for us here, doubt-\nless, the most uncircumventable theme. Hegel thought absolute dif-\nference, and showed that it can be pure only by being impure. In the\nScience of Logic, as concerns Absolute Difference, Hegel writes, for\nexample: \u201cThis difference is difference in-and-for-itself, absolute dif-\nference, the difference of Essence. It is difference in-and-for-itself not\nby the effect of an external cause, but a difference in relation to itself,\nthus a simple difference. It is essential to see in absolute difference a\nsimple difference . . . Difference in itself is difference in relation to\nitself; thus it is its own negativity, difference not in relation to an other,\nbut in relation to itself . . . What differentiates difference is identity.\nDifference, thus, is both itself and identity. Both together make\nnotes to pages 186\u201392 411\n"

In the Logische Untersuchungen he writes: \u201cI set out from\nan absolute conviction that, like logic in general, the logic of deductive\nscience awaited its philosophical clari\ufb01cation from psychology (ibid.,\nvol. 1, p. vi). And an article written shortly after the Philosophic der\nArithmetik, Husserl asserts again: \u201cI believe it possible to maintain\nthat no theory of judgment will ever be in agreement with the facts if it\nis not based upon a profound study of the descriptive and genetic\nrelations between intuitions and representations\u201d (\u201cPsychologische\nStudien zur elementaren Logik,\u201d Philosophische Monatshefte 33 [Berlin,\n1894]: 187 (my italics).\n4.

This\npsychological foundation never seemed to me to suf\ufb01ce for certain\ndevelopments. Whenever it was a question of the origin of mathemat-\nical determinations, or of the in fact psychologically determined shap-\ning of practical methods, the results of psychological analysis\nappeared to me to be clear and instructive. But as soon as the transi-\ntion from the psychological developments of thought to the logical\nunity of the content of thought (the unity of theory) was made, no real\ncontinuity or clarity was apparent\u201d (ibid., vol. 1, p. vii).\n6.\nHusserl writes: \u201cI do not understand how he [Dilthey] believes that he\nhas gained decisive grounds against skepticism on the basis of his very\ninstructive analysis of the structure and typology of Weltanschauun-\ngen\u201d (Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft [Frankfurt 1965], p. 53).

Dorian\nCairns [The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1960], see. 33, p. 68).\n21. \u201cNow, however, we must call attention to a great gap in our exposition.\nThe ego is himself existent for himself in continuous evidence; thus, in\nhimself, he is continuously constituting himself as existing. Heretofore we\nhave touched on only one side of this self-constitution, we have looked\nat only the \ufb02owing cogito. The ego grasps himself not only as a \ufb02owing\nlife but also as I, who live this and that subjective process, who live\nthrough this and that cogito as the same I. Since we were busied up to\nnow with the intentional relation of consciousness to object, cogito to\ncogitatum . . .\u201d etc. (ibid., p. 66).\n22. \u201cAccess to the ultimate universalities involved in problems of eidetic\nphenomenology is, however, very dif\ufb01cult. This is particularly true with\nrespect to an ultimate genesis.

The phenom-\nenology developed at \ufb01rst is merely \u2018static\u2019; its descriptions are\nanalogous to those of natural history, which concerns particular types\nand, at best, arranges them in their systematic order. Questions of\nuniversal genesis and the genetic structure of the ego in his universal-\nity, so far as that structure is more than temporal formation, are still\nfar away; and, indeed, they belong to a higher level. But even when they\nare raised, it is with a restriction. At \ufb01rst, even eidetic observation will\nconsider an ego as such with the restriction that a constituted world\nalready exists for him. This, moreover, is a necessary level; only by\nlaying open the law-forms of the genesis pertaining to this level can\none see the possibilities of a maximally universal eidetic phenomen-\nology\u201d (ibid., pp. 76\u201377).\n23.

Auto-affection refers also to Heidegger\u2019s analysis of Kant\u2019s notion\nof time in Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics. As can be seen in the\nnext few sentences the concept of auto-affection is concerned with\ntime as the self-generating in\ufb01nite series of present moments. Here\nDerrida is beginning the important analysis of speech as that which\nmakes truth present. It is this analysis which will allow him to view the\ntreatment of writing by philosophy as an index of the similar paradoxes\ncontained within the notions of speech and presence. Derrida\u2019s book\non Husserl, La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne (Paris: P.U.F., 1967) contains an\nextended analysis of speech as auto-affection.\n26. Cartesian Meditations, sec. 60, p. 139.\n27.

Certainly, like the name of God, which Husserl also\ncalls Entelechy, these notions are designated by a transcendental\nindex, and their metaphysical virtue is neutralized by phenomeno-\nlogical brackets.
