Truth, however, \nis regarded as a distinctive character of assertion as so derived. Thus the \nroots of the truth of assertion reach back to the disclosedness of the under\u00db \nstanding.xl But over and above these indications of how the truth of \nassertion has originated, the phenomenon of agreement must not be \nexhibited explicit[y in its derivative character. \nOur Being alongside entities within-the-world is concern, and this is \nBeing which uncovers. To Dasein's disclosedness, however, discourse \nbelongs essentially.xll Dasein expresses itself [spricht sich a us] : it expresses \n224 \nitself as a Being-towards entities-a Being-towards which uncovers. And \nin assertion it expresses itself as such about entities which have been \nuncovered. Assertion communicates entities in the \"how\" of their un\u00dc \ncoveredness. When Dasein is aware of the communication, it brings itself \nin its awareness into an uncovering Being-towards the entities discussed. \nThe assertion which is expressed is about something, and in what it is \nabout [in ihrem Woriiber] it contains the uncoveredness of these entities. \nThis uncoveredness is preserved in what is expressed. What is expressed \nbecomes, as it were, something ready-to-hand within-the-world which can \nbe taken up and spoken again.1 Because the uncoveredness has been \npreserved, that which is expressed (which thus is ready-to-hand) has in \nitself a relation to any entities about which it is, an assertion. Any un\u00ad\ncoveredness is an uncoveredness of something. Even when Dasein speaks \nover again what someone else has said, it comes into a Being-towards the \nvery entities which have been discussed. 3 But it has been exempted from \nhaving to uncover them again, primordially, and it holds that it has \nbeen thus exempted. \nDasein need not bring itself face to face with entities themselves in an \n'original' experience ; but it nevertheless remains in a Being-towards these \nentities. In a large measure uncoveredness gets appropriated not by one's \nown uncovering, but rather by hearsay of something that has been said. \n1 'Das Ausgesprochene wird gleichsam zu einem innerweldich Zuhandenen, das \naufgenommen und weitergesprochen werden kann.' While we have \u00b7followed our usual \npolicy in translating 'das Ausgesprochene' as 'what is expressed', it might perhaps be \ntranslated as 'that which is spoken out', 'the utterance', or even 'the pronouncement'. \n2 \"Auch im Nachsprechen kommt das nachsprechende Dasein in ein Sein zum be\u00ad\nsprochenen Seienden selbst.' \n"

If, however, these entities are to be appropriated explicitly with \nregard to their uncoveredness, this amounts to saying that the assertion \nis to be demonstrated as one that uncovers. But the assertion expressed is \nsomething ready-to-hand, and indeed in such a way that, as something \nby which uncoveredness is preserved, it has in itself a relation to the \nentities uncovered. Now to demonstrate that it is something which \nuncovers [ihres Entdeckend-seins] means to demonstrate how the asser\u00ad\ntion by which the uncoveredness is preserved is related to these entities. \nThe assertion is something ready-to-hand. The entities to which it is \nrelated as something that uncovers, are either ready-to-hand or present\u00ad\nat-hand within-the-world.

The necessity of this \nFact, however, is based in turn upon the kind of Being which Dasein itself \npossesses.

The uncoveredness which belongs \nto uncovering, is something that we come across proximally within-the\u00ad\nworld in that which has been expressed [im Ausgesprochenen].

As long as such a proof is still outstanding, this principle \nremains a fanciful contention which does not gain in legitimacy from \nhaving philosophers commonly 'believe' it. \nBecause the kind of Being that is essential to truth is of the character of Dasein, \nall truth is relative to Dasein's Being. Does this relativity signify that all truth \nis 'subjective' ?  If one Interprets 'subjective' as 'left to the subject's discre\u00ad\ntion', then it certainly does not. For uncovering, in the sense which is most \nits own, takes asserting out of the province of 'subjective' discretion, and \nbrings the uncovering Dasein face to face with the entities themselves. \nAnd only because 'truth', as uncovering, is a kind of Being which belongs to \nDasein, can it be taken out of the province of Dasein's discretion. Even the \n'universal validity' of truth is rooted solely in the fact that Dasein can \nuncover entities in themselves and free them. Only so can these entities \nin themselves be binding for every possible assertion-that is, for \nevery way of pointing them out.1 If truth has been correctly under\u00ad\nstood, is it in the least impaired by the fact that it is ontically possible \nonly in the 'subject' and that it stands and falls with the Being of that \n'subject' ? \nNow that we have an existential conception of the kind of Being that \nbelongs to truth, the meaning of \"presupposing the truth11 also becomes \nintelligible. Why must we presuppose that there is truth? What is 'presupposing' ? \nWhat do we have in mind with the 'must' and the 'we' ? What does it \nmean to say 'there is truth' ? 'We' presuppose truth because 'we', being \nin the kind of Being which Dasein possesses, are 'in the truth'. We do not \npresuppose it as something 'outside' us and 'above' us, towards which, \nalong with other 'values', we comport ourselves. It is not we who pre\u00ad\nsuppose 'truth' ; but it is 'truth' that makes it at all possible ontologically \n228 \nfor us to be able to be such that we 'presuppose' anything at all. Truth is \nwhat first makes possible anything like presupposing. \nWhat does it mean to 'presuppose' ? It is to understand something as \nthe ground for the Being of some other entity. Such understanding of an \nentity in its interconnections of Being, is possible only on the ground of \ndisclosedness-that is, on the ground of Dasein's Being something which \nuncovers. Thus to presuppose 'truth' means to understand it as something \nfor the sake of which Dasein i s. But Dasein is already ahead of itself in \neach case ; this is implied in its state-of-Being as care. It is an entity for \nwhich, in its Being, its ownmost potentiality-for-Being is an issue.

In \nDasein's state-of-Being as care, in Being-ahead-of-itself, lies the most \nprimordial 'presupposing'. Because this presupposing of itself belongs to Dasein' s \nBeing, 'we' must also presuppose 'ourselves' as having the attribute of disclosedness. \nThere are also entities with a character other than that of Dasein, but the \n'presupposing' which lies in Dasein's Being does not relate itself to these ; \nit relates itself solely to Dasein itself. The truth which has been pre\u00ad\nsupposed, or the 'there is' by which its Being is to be defined, has that \nkind of Being-or meaning of Being-which belongs to Dasein itself. We \nmust 'make' the presupposition of truth because it is one that has been \n'made' already with the Being of the 'we'. \nWe must presuppose truth. Dasein itself, as in each case m y  Dasein and \nthis Dasein, must be ; and in the same way the truth, as Dasein's dis\u00ad\nclosedness, must be. This belongs to Dasein's essential thrownness into the \nworld. Has Dasein as itself ever decided freely whether it wants to come into \n'Dasein' or not, and will it ever be able to make such a decision? 'In itself' it is \nquite incomprehensible why entities are to be uncovered, why truth and \nDasein must be. The usual refutation of that scepticism which denies \neither the Being of 'truth' or its cognizability, stops half way. What it \nshows, as a formal argument, is simply that if anything gets judged, truth \nhas been presupposed. This suggests that 'truth' belongs to assertion-\nthat pointing something out is, by its very meaning, an uncovering. But \nwhen one says this, one has to clarify why that in which there lies the onto\u00ad\nlogical ground for this necessary connection between assertion and truth \nas regards their Being, must be as it is-. The kind of Being which belongs \nto truth is likewise left completely obscure, and so is the meaning of \npresupposing, and that of its ontological foundation in Dasein itself. \nMoreover, one here fails to recognize that even when nobody judges, \n229 \ntruth already gets presupposed in so far as Dasein i s at all. \nA sceptic can no more be refuted than the Being of truth can be \n'proved'. And if any sceptic of the kind who denies the truth, factically is, \nhe does not even need to be refuted. In so far as he is, and has understood \nhimself in this Being, he has obliterated Dasein in the desperation of \nsuicide; and in doing so, he has also obliterated truth. Because Dasein, \nfor its own part, cannot first be subjected to proof, the necessity of truth \ncannot be proved either. It has no more been demonstrated that there \never has 'been' an 'actual' sceptic2 (though this is what has at bottom \n1 Reading 'und darin' with the newer editions.

But as something of the character of Dasein, \ndeath is only in an existentiell Being towards death [Sein \u0135um Tode]. The \nexistential structure of such Being proves to be the ontologically constitu\u00ad\ntive state of Dasein's potentiality-for-Being-a-whole. Thus the whole \nexisting Dasein allows itself to be brought into our existential fore-having. \nBut can Dasein also exist authentically as a whole ? How is the authenticity \nof existence to be determined at all, if not with regard to authentic \nexisting? Where do we get our criterion for this ? Manifestly, Dasein \nitself must, in its Being, present us with the possibility and the manner of \nits authentic existence, unless such existence is something that can be \nimposed upon it ontically, or ontologically fabricated. But an authentic \npotentiality-for-Being is attested by the conscience. And conscience, as a \nphenomenon of Dasein, demands, like death, a genuinely existential \nInterpretation. Such an Interpretation leads to the insight that Dasein has \nan authentic potentiality-for-Being in that it wants to have a conscience. But \nthis is an existentiell possibility which tends, from the very meaning of its \nBeing, to be made definite in an existentiell way by Being-towards-death. \nBy pointing out that Dasein has an authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole, \nthe existential analytic acquires assurance as to the constitution ofDasein's \nprimordial Being. But at the same time the authentic potentiality-for-Being\u00ad\na-whole becomes visible as a mode of care. And therewith the pheno\u00ad\nmenally adequate ground for a primordial Interpretation of the meaning \nof Dasein's Being has also been assured. \nBut the primordial ontological basis for Dasein's existentiality is tem\u00ad\nporality.

The 'time' which \nis experienced in such reckoning is that phenomenal aspect of temporality \nwhich is closest to us. Out ofit arises the ordinary everyday understanding \nof time. And this understanding evolves into the traditional conception \nof time. \nBy casting light on the source of the 'time' 'in which' entities within\u00ad\nthe-world are encountered-time as \"within-time-ness\"-we shall make \nmanifest an essential possibility of the temporalizing of temporaiity.1 \nTherewith the understanding prepares itself for an even more primordial \ntemporalizing of temporality.

It is necessary for us \n236 \nto bring the whole Dasein into our fore-having. We must accordingly ask \nwhether this entity, as something existing, can ever become accessible in \nits Being-a-whole. In Dasein's very state of Being, there are important \nreasons which seem to speak against the possibility of having it presented \n[Vorgabe] in the manner required. \nThe possibility of this entity's Being-a-whole is manifestly inconsistent \nwith the ontological meaning of care, and care is that which forms the \ntotality of Dasein's structural whole. Yet the primary item in care is \nthe 'ahead-of-itself', and this means that in every case Dasein exists for the \nsake of itself. 'As long as it is', right to its end, it comports itself towards its \npotentiality-for-Being. Even when it still exists but has nothing more \n'before it' and has 'settled [ abgeschlossen] its account', its Being is still \ndetermined by the 'ahead-of-itself'. Hopelessness, for instance, does not \ntear Dasein away from its possibilities, but is only one of its own modes of \nBeing towards these possibilities. Even when one is without Illusions and \n'is ready for an.ything' [\"Gefasstsein auf Alles\"], here too the 'ahead-of\u00ad\nitself' lies hidden. The 'ahead-of-itself', as an item in the structure of care, \ntells us unambiguously that in Dasein there is always something still \noutstanding, 1 which, as a potentiality-for-Being for Dasein itself, has not \nyet become 'actual'. It is essential to the basic constitution ofDasein that \nthere is constantly something still to be settled [eine stiindige Unabgeschlossenheit]. \nSuch a lack of totality signifies that there is something still outstanding in \none's potentiality-for-Being. \n1 ' . . .  im Dasein immer noch etwas aussteht .\n\u2022\n .' The verb 'ausstehen' and the noun \n'Ausstand' (which we usually translate as 'something still outstanding', etc.), are ordin\u00ad\narily used in German to apply to a debt or a bank deposit which, from the point of view \nof the lender or depositor, has yet to be repaid to him, liquidated, or withdrawn. \n"

I \nwill guarantee the possibility of an ontological Interpretation of death. \nBut even if the analysis of Dasein's end and totality takes on so broad \nan orientation, this cannot mean that the existential concepts of end and \ntotality are to be obtained by way of a deduction. On the contrary, the \ne:ristential meaning of Dasein's coming-to-an-end must be taken from \nDasein itself, and we must show how such 'ending' can constitute Being\u00ad\na-whole for the entity which exists. \nWe may formulate in three theses the discussion of death up to this \npoint : 1 .  there belongs to Dasein, as long as it is, a \"not-yet\" which it \nwill be-that which is constantly still outstanding; 2. the coming-to-its-end \nof what-is-not-yet-at-an-end (in which what is still outstanding is liquid\u00ad\nated as regards its Being) has the character ofno-longer-Dasein ; 3\u00b7 coming\u00ad\nto-an-end implies a mode of Being in which the particular Dasein simply \ncannot be represented by someone else. \nIn Dasein there is undeniably a constant 'lack of totality' which finds \nan end with death. This \"not-yet\" 'belongs' to Dasein as long as it is ; \nthis is how things stand phenomenally. Is this to be Interpreted as still \noutstanding?1 With relation to what entities do we talk about that which \nis still outstanding ? When we use this expression we have in view that \nwhich indeed 'belongs' to an entity, but is still missing. Outstanding, as a \nway of being missing, is grounded upon a belonging-to. 2 For instance, the \nremainder yet to be received when a debt is to be balanced off, is still \noutstanding. That which is still outstanding is not yet at one's disposal. \nWhen the 'debt' gets paid off, that which is still outstanding gets liquid\u00ad\nated ; this signifies that the money 'comes in', or, in other words, that the \nremainder comes successively along. By this procedure the \"not-yet\" gets \nfilled up, as it were, until the sum that is owed is \"all together\". 3 There\u00ad\nfore, to be still outstanding means that what belongs together is not yet \nall together. Ontologically, this implies the un-readiness-to-hand of those \nportions which have yet to be contributed. These portions have the same \nkind of Being as those which are ready-to-hand already ; and the latter, \nfor their part, do not have their kind of Being modified by having the \nremainder come in. Whatever \"lack-of-togetherness\" remains [Das beste\u00ad\nhende Unzusammen] gets \"paid off' by a cumulative piecing-together. \nEntities for which anything is still outstanding have the kind of Being of something \n1 'Aber darf der phanomenale Tatbestand, dass zum Dasein, solange es ist, dieses \nNoch-nicht \"gehort\", als Ausstand interpretiert werden ?' The contrast between 'Tatbest\u00ad\nand' and 'Ausstand' is perhaps intentional. \n2 Ausstehen als Fehlen griindet in einer Zugehorigkeit.' \n8 'Tilgung der \"Schuld\" als Behebung des Ausstandes bedeutet das \"Eingehen\", das \nist Nacheinanderankommen des Restes, wodurch das Noch-nicht gleichsam aufgefullt \nwird, bis die geschuldete Summe \"beisammen\" ist.'

The \"not-yet\" has already been \nincluded in the very Being of the fruit, not as some random characteristic, \nbut as something constitutive. Correspondingly, as long as any Dasein is, \nit too is already its \"not-yet\" .111 \nThat which makes up the 'lack of totality' in Dasein, the constant \n\"ahead-of-itself\", is neither something still outstanding in a summative \ntogetherness, nor something which has not yet become accessible.

But in doing \nso, has it necessarily exhausted its specific possibilities ? Rather, are not \nthese precisely what gets taken away from Dasein? Even 'unfulfilled' \nDasein ends. On the other hand, so little is it the case that Dasein comes \nto its ripeness only with death, that Dasein may well have passed its \nripeness before the end. 3 For the most part, Dasein ends in unfulfilment, \nor else by having disintegrated and been used up. \n1 'Die noch nicht volle Summe ist als Zuhandenes gegen den fehlenden unzuhand'enen \nRest \"gleichgiiltig\". Streng genommen kann sie weder ungleichgiiltig, noch gleichgiiltig \ndagegen sein.' \n2 'Mit der Reife vollendet sich die Frucht.' Notice that the verb 'vollenden', which we \nhere translate as 'fulfil', involves the verb 'enden' ('to end'). While 'vollenden' may mean \n'to bring fully to an end' or 'to terminate', it may also mean 'to complete' or 'to perfect'. \n3 While we have translated 'Reife' by its cognate 'ripeness', this word applies generally \nto almost any kind of maturity, even that of Dasein-not merely the maturity of fruits \nand vegetables, \n"

It thus becomes \nmore urgent to ask in what sense, if any, death must he conceived as the ending \nof Dasein. \nIn the first instance, \"ending\" signifies \"stopping\", and it signifies this \nin senses which are ontologically different. The rain stops. It is no longer \npresent-at-hand. The road stops. Such an ending does not make the road \ndisappear, but such a stopping is determinative for the road as this one, \nwhich is present-at-hand. Hence ending, as stopping, can signify either \n245 \n\"passing over into non-presence-at-hand\" or else \"Being-present-at-hand \nonly when the end comes\". The latter kind of ending, in turn, may either \nbe determinative for something which is present-at-hand in an unfinished \nway, as a road breaks off when one finds it under construction; or it may \nrather constitute the 'finishedness\" of something present-at-hand, as the \npainting is finished with the last stroke of the brush. \nBut ending as \"getting finished\" does not include fulfilling. On the \nother hand, whatever has got to be fulfilled must indeed reach the finished\u00ad\nness that is possible for it. Fulfilling is a mode of 'finishedness', and is \nfounded upon it. Finishedness is itself possible only as a determinate form \nof something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand. \nEven ending in the sense of \"disappearing\" can still have its modifica\u00ad\ntions according to the kind of Being which an entity may have. The rain \nis at an end-that is to say it has disappeared. The bread is at an end\u00ad\nthat is to say, it has been used up and is no longer available as something \nready-to-hand. \nBy none of these modes of ending can death he suitably characterized as the \"end\" \nof Dasein. If dying, as Being-at-an-end, were understood in the sense of an \nending of the kind we have discussed, then Dasein would thereby be \ntreated as something present-at-hand or ready-to-hand. In death, Dasein \nhas not been fulfilled nor has it simply disappeared ; it has not become \nfinished nor is it wholly at one's disposal as something ready-to-hand. \nOn the contrary, just as Dasein is already its \"not-yet\", and is its \n\"not-yet\" constantly as long as it is, it is already its end too. The \"ending\" \nwhich we have in view when we speak of death, does not signify Dasein's \nBeing-at-an-end [Zu-Ende-sein], but a Being-towards-the-end [Sein zum \nEnde] of this entity. Death is a way to be, which Dasein takes over as soon \nas it is. \"As soon as man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die.'iv \nEnding, as Being-towards-the-end, must be clarified ontologically in \nterms of Dasein's kind of Being.

Dasein too 'has' its \ndeath, of the kind appropriate to anything that lives ; and it has it, not in \nontical isolation, but as codetermined by its primordial kind of Being. \nIn so far as this is the case, Dasein too can end without authentically \ndying, though on the other hand, qua Dasein, it does not simply perish. \nWe designate this intermediate phenomenon as its \"demise\".1 Let the term \n\"dying\" stand for that way of Being in which Dasein is towards its death. 2 \nAccordingly we must say that Dasein never perishes. Dasein, however, \ncan demise only as long as it is dying. Medical and biological investiga-\ntion into \"demising\" can obtain results which may even become significant \nontologically if the basic orientation for an existential Interpretation of \ndeath has been made secure. Or must sickness and death in general-\neven from a medical point of view-be primarily conceived as existential \nphenomena ? \nThe existential Interpretation of death takes precedence over any \nbiology and ontology oflife. But it is also the foundation for any investiga\u00ad\ntion of death which is biographical or historiological, ethnological or \npsychological. In any 'typology' of 'dying', as a characterization of the \nconditions under which a demise is 'Experienced' and of the ways in \nwhich it is 'Experienced', the concept of death is already presupposed. \nMoreover, a psychology of 'dying' gives information about the 'living' of \nthe person who is 'dying', rather than about dying itself. This simply \nreflects thefact thatwhen Daseindies-and even when it dies authentically \n-it does not have to do so with an Experience of its factical demising, or \nin such an Experience. Likewise the ways in which death is taken among \n1 'Abkben'. This term, which literally means something like 'living out' one's life, is \nused in ordinary German as a rather legalistic term for a person's death. We shall translate \nit as 'demise' (both as a noun and as a verb), which also has legalistic connotations. But \nthis translation is an arbitrary one, and does not adequately express the meaning which \nHeidegger is explaining. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n Seinsweise, in der das Dasein zu seinem Tode ist.' \n"

If\"death\" is defined as the 'end' ofDasein-that is to say, of Being\u00ad\nin-the-world-this does not imply any ontical decision whether 'after \ndeath' still another Being is possible, either higher or lower, or whether \n248 \nDasein 'lives on' or even 'outlasts' itself and is 'immortal'. Nor is anything \ndecided ontically about the 'other-worldly' and its possibility, any more \nthan about the 'this-worldly' ; 1 it is not as if norms and rules for comporting \noneself towards death were to be proposed for 'edification'. But our \nanalysis of death remains purely 'this-worldly' in so far as it Interprets \nthat phenomenon merely in the way in which it enters into any particular \nDasein as a possibility of its Being. Only when death is conceived in its full \nontological essence can we have any methodological assurance in even asking \nwhat may be after death; only then can we do so with meaning and justifica\u00ad\ntion. Whether such a question is a possible theoretical question at all will \nnot be decided here. The this-worldly ontological Interpretation of death \ntakes precedence over any ontical other-worldly speculation. \nFinally, what might be discussed under the topic of a 'metaphysic of \ndeath' lies outside the domain of an existential analysis of death. Questions \nof how and when death 'came into the world', what 'meaning' it can \nhave and is to have as an evil and affliction in the aggregate of entities\u00ad\nthese are questions which necessarily presuppose an understanding not \nonly of the character of Being which belongs to death, but of the ontology \nof the aggregate of entities as a whole, and especially of the ontological \nclarification of evil and negativity in general. \nMethodologically, the existential analysis is superordinate to the ques\u00ad\ntions of a biology, psychology, theodicy, or theology of death. Taken \nontically, the results of the analysis show the peculiar formality and empti\u00ad\nness of any ontological characterization. However, that must not blind us \nto the rich and complicated structure of the phenomenon. If Dasein in \ngeneral never becomes accessible as something present-at-hand, because \nBeing-possible belongs in its own way to Dasein's kind of Being, even less \nmay we expect that we can simply read off the ontological structure of \ndeath, if death is indeed a distinctive possibility of Dasein. \nOn the other hand, the analysis cannot keep clinging to an idea of death \n1 'Ober das ''Jenseits\" und seine Moglichkeit wird ebensowenig ontisch entschicden \nwie iiber das \"Dicscits\" \u2022\n\u2022\n .'

Only so can it be made plain to what extent Being-a-whole, \nas constituted by Being towards-the-end, is possible in Dasein itself in \nconformity with the structure of its Being. We have seen that care is the \nbasic state of Dasein. The ontological signification of the expression \n\"care\" has been expressed in the 'definition' : \"ahead-of-itself-Being\u00ad\nalready-in (the world) as Being-alongside entities which we encounter \n(within-the-world)\".vll In this are expressed the fundamental character-\nistics ofDasein's Being : existence, in the \"ahead-of-itself\" ; facticity, in the \n250 \n\"Being-already-in\" ; falling, in the \"Being-alongside\". If indeed death \nbelongs in a distinctive sense to the Being ofDasein, then death (or Being\u00ad\ntowards-the-end) must be defined in terms of these characteristics. \nWe must, in the first instance, make plain in a preliminary sketch how \nDasein's existence, facticity, and falling reveal themselves in the pheno\u00ad\nmenon of death. \nThe Interpretation in which the \"not-yet-and with it even the utter\u00ad\nmost \"not-yet\", the end of Dasein-:-was taken in the sense of something \nstill outstanding, has been rejected as inappropriate in that it included the \nontological perversion of making Dasein something present-at-hand. \nBeing-at-an-end implies existentially Being-towards-the-end. The utter\u00ad\nmost \"not-yet\" has the character of something towards which Dasein \ncomports itself. The end is impending [steht . . .  bevor] for Dasein.

On the contrary, if Dasein exists, \nit has already been thrown into this possibility. Dasein does not, proximally \nand for the most part, have any explicit or even any theoretical knowledge \nof the fact that it has been delivered over to its death, and that death thus \nbelongs to Being-in-the-world. Thrownness into death reveals itself to \nDasein in a more primordial and impressive manner in that state-of-mind \nwhich we have called \"anxiety\". viii Anxiety in the face of death is anxiety \n'in the face of' that potentiality-for-Being which is one's ownmost, non\u00ad\nrelational, and not to be outstripped. That in the face of which one has \nanxiety is Being-in-the-world itself. That about which one has this anxiety \nis simply Dasein's potentiality-for-Being. Anxiety in the face of death \nmust not be confused with fear in the face of one's demise. This anxiety \nis not an accidental or random mood of 'weakness' in some individual ; \nbut, as a basic state-of-mind of Dasein, it amounts to the disclosedness of \nthe fact that Dasein exists as thrown Being towards its end.

The factical 'knowledge' or 'ignorance' \nwhich prevails in any Dasein as to its ownmost' Being-towards-the-end, is \nonly the expression of the existentiell possibility that there are different \nways of maintaining oneself in this Being. Factically, there are many who, \nproximally and for the most part, do not know about death; but this must \nnot be passed off as a ground for proving that Being-towards-death does not \nbelong to Dasein 'universally'. It only proves that proximally and for the \nmost part Dasein covers up its ownmost Being-towards-death, fleeing in \nthe face of it. Factically, Dasein is dying as long as it exists, but proximally \nand for the most part, it does so by way ofjalling. For factical existing is \n252 \nnot only generally and without further differentiation a thrown poten\u00ad\ntiality-for-Being-in-the-world, but it has always likewise been absorbed in \nthe 'world' of its concern.

As regards its ontological possibility, dying is \ngrounded in care. \nBut if Being-towards-death belongs primordially and essentially to \nDasein's Being, then it must also be exhibitable in everydayness, even if \nproximally in a way which is inauthentic.1 And if Being-towards-the-end \nshould afford the existential possibility of an ex.istentiell Being-a-whole for \nDasein, then this would give phenomenal confirmation for the thesis that \n\"care\" is the ontological term for the totality of Dasein's structural whole. \nIf, however, we are to provide a full phenomenal justification for this \nprinciple, a preliminary sketch of the connection between Being-towards\u00ad\ndeath and care is not sufficient; We must be able to see this connection \nabove all in that concretion which lies closest to Dasein-its everydayness. \n\u0102 5 r.

The foundation of any interpretation \nis an act of understanding, which is always accompanied by a state-of\u00ad\nmind, or, in other words, which has a mood. So we must ask how Being\u00ad\ntowards-death is disclosed by the kind of understanding which, with its \nstate-of-mind, lurks in the idle talk , of the \"they\". How does the \"they\" \ncomport itself understandingly towards that ownmost possibility ofDasein, \nwhich is non-relational and is not to be outstripped ? What state-of-mind \ndiscloses to the \"they\" that it has been delivered over to death, and in \nwhat way? \nIn the publicness with which we are with one another in our everyday \nmanner, death is 'known' as a mishap which is constantly occurring-as \n253 \na 'case of death'. 3 Someone or other 'dies', be he neighbour or stranger \n1 '0 \n0 0 dann muss es auch-wenngleich zunachst uneigentlich-in der Alltaglichkeit \naufweisbar seino' The earlier editions have another 'auch' just before 'in der Alltaglichkeit'o \n2 'o .\n. das sich in der iiffentlichen Ausgelegtheit konstituiert, die sich im Gerede auss\u00ad\nprichto' The earlier editions have ' \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n konstituiert.

The \"they\" \nhas already stowed away [gesichert] an interpretation for this event. It \ntalks of it in a 'fugitive' manner, either expressly or else in a way which is \nmostly inhibited, as if to say, \"One of these days one will die too, in the \nend ; but right now it has nothing to do with us.\"l \nThe analysis of the phrase 'one dies' reveals unambiguously the kind \nof Being which belongs to everyday Being-towards-death. In such a way \nof talking, death is understood as an indefinite something which, above all, \nmust duly arrive from somewhere or other, but which is proximally not \nyet present-at-hand for oneself, and is therefore no threat. The expression \n'one dies' spreads abroad the opinion that what gets reached, as it were, \nby death, is the \"they\". In Dasein's public way of interpreting, it is said \nthat 'one dies', because everyone else and oneself can talk himself into \nsaying that \"in no case is it I myself\", for this \"one\" is the \"nobody\".2 \n'Dying' is levelled off to an occurrence which reaches Dasein, to be sure, \nbut belongs to nobody in particular. If idle talk is always ambiguous, so \nis this manner of talking about death. Dying, which is essentially mine \nin such a way that no one can be my representative, is perverted into an \nevent of public occurrence which the \"they\" encounters. In the way of \ntalking which we have characterized, death is spoken of as a 'case' which \nis constantly occurring. Death gets passed off as always something 'actual' ;  \nits character as a possibility gets concealed, and so are the other two \nitems that belong to it-the fact that it is non-relational and that it is not \nto be outstripped. By such ambiguity, Dasein puts itself in the position \nof losing itself in the \"they\" as regards a distinctive potentiality-for-Being \nwhich belongs to Dasein's ownmost Self. The \"they\" gives its approval, \nand aggravates the temptation to cover up from oneself one's ownmost \nBeing-towards-death.xl \nThis evasive concealment in the face of death \ndominates everydayness so stubbornly that, in Being with one another, the \n'neighbours' often still keep talking the 'dying person' into the belief that \nhe will escape death and soon return to the tranquillized everydayness of \nthe world of his concern. Such 'solicitude' is meant to 'console' him. It \ninsists upon bringing him back into Dasein, while in addition it helps him \n1 ' . . .  man stirbt am Ende auch einmal, aber zunachst bleibt man selbst unbetroffen.' \n2 'Die iiffentliche Daseinsauslegung sagt: \"man stirbt\", weil damit jeder andere und \nman selbst sich einreden kann : je nicht gerade ich ; denn dieses Man ist das Niemand.' \nWhile we have usually followed the convention of translating the indefinite pronoun \n'man' as 'one' and the expression 'das Man' as 'the \"they\" ', to do so here would obscure \nthe point. \n"

This is \nthe case when its concern is merely in the mode of an untroubled indiference towards \nthe uttermost possibility of existence.1 \nIn setting forth everyday Being-towards-death, however, we are at the \nsame time enjoined to try to secure a full existential conception of Being\u00ad\ntowards-the-end, by a more penetrating Interpretation in which falling \nBeing-towards-death is taken as an evasion in the face of death. That in the \nface of which one flees has been made visible in a way which is phenomenally \nadequate. Against this it must be possible to project phenomenologically \nthe way in which evasive Dasein itself understands its death.xlll \n\u00e6 52. Everyday Being-towards-the-end, and the Full Existential Conception of \nDeath \nIn our preliminary existential sketch, Being-towards-the-end has been \ndefined as Being towards one's ownmost potentiality-for-Being, which is \nnon-relational and is not to be outstripped. Being towards this possibility, \nas a Being which exists, is brought face to face with the absolute impos\u00ad\nsibility of existence. Beyond this seemingly empty characterization of \nBeing-towards-death, there has been revealed the concretion of this Being \nin the mode of everydayness. In accordance with the tendency to falling, \nwhich is essential to everydayness, Being-towards-death has turned out to \nbe an evasion in the face of death-an evasion which conceals. While our \ninvestigation has hitherto passed from a formal sketch of the ontological \nstructure of death to the concrete analysis of everyday Being-towards-the\u00ad\nend, the direction is now to be reversed, and we shall arrive at the full \nexistential conception of death by rounding out our Interpretation of \neveryday Being-towards-the-end. \nIn explicating everyday Being-towards-death we have clung to the idle \ntalk of the \"they\" to the effect that \"one dies too, sometime, but not right \naway.\"2 All that we have Interpreted thus far is the 'one dies' as such. In \nthe 'sometime, but not right away', everydayness concedes something like \na certainty of death. Nobody doubts that one dies. On the other hand, this \n'not doubting' need no\u00e7 imply that kind of Being-certain which corre\u00ad\nsponds to the way death-in the sense of the distinctive possibility char\u00ad\nacterized above-enters into Dasein. Everydayness confines itself to \n1 ' .\n.\n\u2022\n wenn auch nur im Modus des Besorgens einer unbehelligten Gleichgiiltigkeit gegen die \niiusserste M oglichkeit seiner Existenz.' Ordinarily the expression 'Gleichgiiltigkeit gegen' \nmeans simply 'indifference towards'.

I \nconceding the 'certainty' of death in this ambiguous manner just in order \nto weaken that certainty by covering up dying still more and to alleviate \nits own thrownness into death. \nBy its very meaning, this evasive concealment in the face of death can \nnot be authentically 'certain' of death, and yet it is certain of it. What are \nwe to say about the 'certainty of death' ? \nTo be certain of an entity means to hold it for true as something true.1 \nBut \"truth\" signifies the uncoveredness of some entity, and all uncovered\u00ad\nness is grounded ontologically in the most primordial truth, the disclosed\u00ad\nness ofDasein.xtv As an entity which is both disclosed and disclosing, and \none which uncovers, Dasein is essentially 'in the truth'. But certainry is \ngrounded in the truth, or belongs to it equiprimordially. The expression 'certainty', \nlike the term 'truth', has a double signification. Primordially \"truth\" \nmeans the same as \"Being-disclosive\", as a way in which Dasein behaves. \nFrom this comes the derivative signification: \"the uncoveredness of \nentities\". Correspondingly, \"certainty\", in its primordial signification, is \ntantamount to \"Being-certain\", as a kind of Being which belongs to \nDasein. However, in a derivative signification, any entity of which \nDasein can be certain will also get called something 'certain'. \nOne mode of certainty is conviction. In conviction, Dasein lets the testi\u00ad\nmony of the thing itself which has been uncovered (the true thing itself) \nbe the sole determinant for its Being towards that thing understandingly. 2 \nHolding something for true is adequate as a way of maintaining oneself \nin the truth, if it is grounded in the uncovered entity itself, and if, as \nBeing towards the entity so uncovered, it has become transparent to itself \nas regards its appropriateness to that entity. In any arbitrary fiction or in \nmerely having some 'view' [\"Ansicht\"] about an entity, this sort of thing \nis lacking. \nThe adequacy of holding-for-true is measured according to the truth\u00ad\nclaim to which it belongs. Such a claim gets its justification from the kind \nof Being of the entity to be disclosed, and from the direction of the dis\u00ad\nclosure. The kind of truth, and along with it, the certainty, varies with \nthe way entities differ, and accords with the guiding tendency and extent \nof the disclosure. Our present considerations will be restricted to an \n1 'Eines Seienden gewiss-sein besagt : es als wahres ftir wahr halten.' The earlier editions \nhave 'Gewisssein' instead of 'gewiss-sein'. Our literal but rather unidiomatic translation \nof the phrase 'ftir wahr hal ten' seems desirable in view of Heidegger's extensive use of the \nverb 'halten' ('hold') in subsequent passages where this phrase occurs, though this is \no_bscured br o\u00d8 \u00d9anslatin\u00da 'hot;n sich i\u00db \n\u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ' as 'maintain itself in \u2022\n\u2022\n .' and 'halten \ns1ch an . . \u2022 as clmg to . . . or suck to .\n.\n.\n\u2022\n \nll 'In ihr llisst sich das Dasein einzig durch das Zeugnis der entdeckten (wahre) Sache \nselbst sein verstehendes Sein zu dieser bestimmen.' The connection between 'Vberzeu\u00ad\ngung' ('conviction') and 'Zeugnis' (testimony) is obscured in our translation. \n"

I \nown character as the kind of entity it is, and it does so in every case in \nterms of a possibility which it itself is and which it understands.1 \nCan Dasein also understand authentically its ownmost possibility, which is \nnon-relational and not to be outstripped, which is certain and, as such, \n260 \nindefinite ? That is, can Dasein maintain itself in an authentic Being\u00ad\ntowards-its-end? As long as this authentic Being-towards-death has not \nbeen set forth and ontologically defined, there is something essentially \nlacking in our existential Interpretation of Being-towards-the-end. \nAuthentic Being-towards-death signifies an existentiell possibility of \nDasein. This ontical potentiality-for-Being must, in turn, be ontologically \npossible. What are the existential conditions of this possibility? How are \nthey themselves to become accessible ? \n\u0101 53\u00b7 Existential Projection of an Authentic Being-towards-death \nFactically, Dasein maintains itself proximally and for the most part in \nan inauthentic Being-towards-death. How is the ontological possibility of \nan authentic Being-towards-death to be characterized 'Objectively', if, in \nthe end, Dasein never comports itself authentically towards its end, or if, \nin accordance with its very meaning, this authentic Being must remain \nhidden from the Others? Is it not a fanciful undertaking, to project the \nexistential possibility of so questionable an existentiell potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing? What is needed, if such a projection is to go beyond a merely \nfictitious arbitrary construction? Does Dasein itself give us any instruc\u00ad\ntions for carrying it out ? And can any grounds for its phenomenal \nlegitimacy be taken from Dasein itself? Can our analysis of Dasein up to \nthis point give us any prescriptions for the ontological task we have now \nset ourselves, so that what we have before us may be kept on a road of \nwhich we can be sure? \nThe existential conception of death has been established; and therewith \nwe have also established what it is that an authentic Being-towards-the\u00ad\nend should be able to comport itself towards. We have also characterized \ninauthentic Being-towards-death, and thus we have prescribed in a \nnegative way [prohibitiv] how it is possible for authentic Being-towards\u00ad\ndeath not to be. It is with these positive and prohibitive instructions that \nthe existential edifice of an authentic Being-towards-death must let itself \nbe projected. \nDasein is constituted by disclosedness-that is, by an understanding \nwith a state-of-mind. Authentic Being-towards-death can not evade its own\u00ad\nmost non-relational possibility, or cover up this possibility by thus fleeing \n1 'Weil das Dasein existiert, bestimmt es sich als Seiendes, wie es ist, je aus einer \nMoglichkeit, die es selbst ist und versteht.' \n"
