For Tocqueville, then, it is Richelieu, not Rous-\nseau, and certainly not Robespierre, who must be regarded as one of the \nvery first authors of the Revolution.\nTerror by this account betrays the resurgence of absolutism within \na political framework that must disavow it\u2014not a passing frenzy but, as \nQuinet writes, the \u201cfixed temperament\u201d of the Revolution, a character in \nwhich we can also discern the indelible imprint of tradition.46 The para-\ndox of the Jacobin dictatorship (\u201cthe despotism of liberty against tyranny\u201d) \nexpresses the temporal dissonance that defines modernity. Terror marks \nthe entanglement between modern liberty and the theological residue that \nsustains it. The regicide marks the symbolic inauguration of political mo-\ndernity: it stages the instantaneous and total transfer of sovereignty from \nking to people. The fall of the blade marks the sublime instant separating \n(but in this way also fusing) before and after, ancien r\u00e9gime and revolu-\ntionary republic: \u201cLe roi est mort\u2014vive la patrie.\u201d This sacrificial logic was \n\u00adceremonially enacted on January 21, 1793, in an event marked, according \nto all the narratives, by sacred pomp and ceremony. It was already formal-\nized at the king\u2019s trial when Robespierre invoked the baptismal quality of \nthe execution. \u201cThe king must die because the nation must live\u201d: an in-\nfinite investment in the sacral body of the king has to be maintained and \neven retroactively generated through the public staging of the king\u2019s ab-\nsolute divestment. The regeneration of the people is the restoration of \nthe\u00a0 nation\u2019s body through the expropriation of the expropriator. Only \nas\u00a0the abject, humiliated body of Louis Capet does the king acquire the \nmajesty sufficient to generate a republic. He gains his absolute status only \nat the moment of relinquishing it.\nAt the trial, Saint-Just argued that it was ultimately the ideology of \nroyal inviolability that condemned Louis insofar as it explicitly located him \noutside the body politic: he was an ennemi \u00e9tranger\u2014a moral \u201cmonster,\u201d the \nabb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire added. Saint-Just himself would perversely be the first to in-\nsist on this fiction of sovereign immunity47 when he refused the king\u2019s canny \nrequest for a civilian trial. Saint-Just was here exploiting a melancholic para-\ndox that would preoccupy Sade, Nietzsche, and eventually \u00adKlossowski and \nBlanchot. How to kill a God who is, effectively, already long dead, who \nnever actually did exist as such: how to mourn what is forever too late to \nmourn\u2014what never was for the having?\n"

Although Hegel barely pauses at the regicide, he is the first to identify \nin the negative theology of the guillotine the link between the terrors of \nmodern democracy and the disavowed fundamentalism on which it rests. \nHe is perhaps the first also to make the connection between this disavowal \nand the compulsive construction of fanaticism as the terrifying fundamen-\ntalism of the Other. War on terror is democracy\u2019s way of abjecting what \nremains its own darkest secret to itself. Insight needs faith: modern de-\nmocracy is just the unfolding of their violent symbiosis through the mel-\nancholic staging of an ungrieved loss.\nWhat Claude Lefort calls the \u201cpersistence of the theological-\u00adpolitical\u201d \nmight be understood as a kind of fetishism: the empty place left by the \nevacuation of transcendence is filled by the self-production of the na-\ntion as power incarnate.48 Lack is here simultaneously acknowledged and \ndisavowed: the sacramental substitution of people for king serves to im-\nmediately close the gap the regicide opens up; this perverse substitution \nunderpins every modern politics of fusion. Genuine democracy, in Lefort\u2019s \nterms, can establish itself only as an unending activity of defetishization\u2014\na ceaseless negotiation to maintain the empty place of power as an active \nvacancy rather than as the usual vacuum into which anything and every-\nthing might flow. One might understand this tenacity, a fidelity to absence \nas such, as a kind of mourning.\nHegel goes further: he establishes that the place was actually always \nempty. This is not simply about the reinstatement of absolutism through \nrevolutionary dictatorship. Absolute monarchy was already an \u201cempty \nname,\u201d a heap of ornaments clustering around an empty throne\u2014legit-\nimacy shrinking even as the emblems and props of power multiplied. It \nis this originary vacancy that modernity both covers up and transmits. \nRevolutionary purity brings into view precisely what it most denies: the \nemptiness at the heart of the symbolic order. This loss does not begin \nwith the self-evacuation of absolute monarchy. The voiding of the king\u2019s \nname is just the delayed registration of the ruination into which beautiful \n\u00adSittlichkeit was thrown\u2014\u201cswallowed up in the simple necessity of a blank \ndestiny\u201d (\u00a7477)\u2014and with it every fantasy of communitarian substance. \n"

Hegel does not simply indulge in this \nfantasy, any more than he seeks to demystify or \u201cenlighten\u201d it by launch-\ning grenades from the other shore. He demonstrates how it is constructed \nand sustained. Step by step, painstakingly, and as only one who knows the \nroutine by heart is capable, Hegel sets out the building blocks of the Ger-\nman ideology.\nPhilosophical Thermidor\nThis is the story that follows the absolute-freedom-and-terror epi-\nsode, as Spirit takes possession of its self-dispossession and comes to recog-\nnize its losses as its own. The bad infinite of suspicion makes terror both \nreflexive\u2014terror inevitably comes to terrify even itself, to denounce and \npurge itself, turning executioner into victim\u2014and in turn self-reflective. \n\u201c[S]elf-consciousness learns what absolute freedom in effect is\u201d (PhG \u00a7592).\nThe point is not to sublimate terror through catharsis or idealiza-\ntion.

Reduced to its minimal spiritual signifi-\ncance, freedom reasserts itself as the infinite productivity of the blade. Re-\npetitive, indefatigable, endlessly inventive in its applications, the guillotine \nputs on display the pure energy of the death drive. As the machine turns \nagainst itself, a fissure opens within subjectivity; this repetitive contraction \nannounces the birth pangs of the modern self. The Thermidorean witch-\nhunt not only prolongs the circle of vengeance but, in setting itself apart \nfrom its own past, poses terror as a question even or especially to itself. It \nintroduces into the immediacy of the general will the sliver of differentia-\ntion that will provide a minimal interval for reflection. All the aporias of \ntransitional justice make a cameo appearance. With the arrest and sum-\nmary execution of Robespierre, perpetrator fuses with victim and the circle \nof terror closes.\nHegel\u2019s interest, however, is not in Thermidor as such, at which he \nonly blinks as a mere reflex of the Revolution, nor in the renewed politi-\ncal structures that were immediately to follow\u2014the rearrangement of the \n"

By the little which now satisfies Spirit, we can measure the extent of \nits loss\u201d (PhG \u00a78).\nMona Ozouf describes Thermidor as a \u201clabor of forgetfulness.\u201d3 Rather \nthan engaging in a mourning work that would inherit, surpass, and trans-\nmit the revolutionary legacy, the Thermidorians sought to normalize the \nevent;\u00a0the Revolution both elided its traumatic memories and suppressed its \nown utopian demands. For Hegel, such a drive to oblivion is structural: it \nexpresses Spirit\u2019s resistance to its own irresistible self-surpassing; political re-\naction is here a variant of a more general conceptual inertia (Tr\u00e4gheit). The \nvarious regressions of the Thermidorian aftermath express the reflexive anxi-\nety unleashed by the Terror\u2014terror\u2019s own terror of itself, its logical inability \nto sustain itself, and the repeated short-\u00adcircuiting of the Revolution to prer-\nevolutionary positions.\nThis Sisyphean cycle echoes the comedy of forgetfulness that had in-\naugurated the epic theater of Spirit. The famous opening act of the Phe-\nnomenology features the burlesque of a subject mulishly clinging to its \nabstractions, in this case the belief in raw, unmediated sensory experience, \nas it lurches about ineffectually, brandishing its monosyllables (\u201cThis!\u201d \n\u201cHere!\u201d \u201cNow!\u201d) like talismans designed to ward off the irredeemable neg-\nativity at its core.

Beneath the slapstick Hegel discerns the thinly veiled melan-\ncholy of a subject dumbstruck by its narcissistic wounds; the loss of one\u2019s \nmost cherished convictions turns every \u201cpathway of doubt\u201d (Zweifel ) into \na \u201cpathway of despair\u201d (Verzweiflung) (PhG \u00a778). The despair is constitu-\ntive. It arises from the internal splitting or duplicity (Zweifalt) defining \nconsciousness as such. Condemned to strike postures it cannot sustain, to \nmeasure itself against standards to which it cannot adhere and that do not \nthemselves cohere, consciousness is inherently torn or \u201ctwofold\u201d\u2014doubt-\nful, desperate, and despairing. Since it defines itself by its own cognitive \ncommitments, it necessarily experiences every loss of certainty as \u201cthe loss \n"

He points to a traumatic kernel at the heart of this well-\nrehearsed teleology. The deferral that drives the movement of imperial ex-\npansion will also void any possibility of eschatological fulfillment. In the \nPhilosophy of History, Hegel links Spirit\u2019s mobility to a dangerous morbidity. \nIf the Idea must continually relocate, if the torch must be constantly handed \non, this is because its incandescence burns, or rather, to shift the metaphor, \nthe poison must continually be expelled; history is the administration of \na time-released toxin whose consumption is fatal to those who secrete it. \n\u201cThe life of a people ripens a certain fruit; its activity aims at the complete \nmanifestation of the principle which it embodies. But this fruit does not fall \nback into the womb of the people that gave birth to it and ripened it; on the \ncontrary, it becomes a bitter drink to it. It cannot leave it alone, for it has an \ninfinite thirst for it; the taste of the drink is its annihilation.\u201d6\nThe image gives a startling twist to Hegel\u2019s more familiar description \nof experience as the organic growth of meaning from seed to blossom to \nfruit and back again (PhG \u00a76).

Hegel here essentially defines history as trans-\ngenerational trauma: experience is the belated and vicarious experience of \nthe missed experience of the other.\nMixing metaphors yet again in the preface to the Phenomenology, \nHegel describes history as a blend of the intangible and the intractable. \nEach generation absorbs the experiences of its precursors in \u201csilhouette\u201d \nand as \u201cinorganic nature\u201d (PhG \u00a728).

The path de-\nscribed by Hegel is notoriously more roundabout. The slave could initially \nexperience his own freedom only through a stoic renunciation of bodily \ndesire, a defiance of natural existence, in which the slave ultimately pro-\nlonged his own servitude by miming the heroic self-assertion of the mas-\nter. This is why Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve calls Stoicism the first ideology.9 By con-\nverting bodily frustration into an expression of sovereign self-reliance, the \nslave justifies his own inaction: I am free as long as I know myself to be so.\nThe transition from absolute-freedom-and-terror to morality repeats, \nat a collective or social level, the earlier passage from lordship/bondage to \nStoicism. Its various stumbling blocks will prove more or less the same.

The will clings to itself \nto supply the phantom objectivity whose appearance it had previously kept \nconjuring up within the terrifying Fort-Da of denunciation and decapita-\ntion.

If he comes very close to reproducing the standard \nGerman idealist understanding of the relation between philosophy and \nterror\u2014Kantian-style freedom of the will as at once the explication, the \nnegation, and the logical successor of revolutionary freedom\u2014he also un-\ndermines this position: he will immediately argue that such freedom on \nits own terms does nothing to redeem the blocked promise of the Revo-\nlution. Hegel makes it bitterly clear that the sublime purity of the moral \nwill can be no antidote to the terrifying purity of revolutionary virtue. He \ndemonstrates that all the features of absolute freedom are carried over into \nKantian morality: the obsessionality, the paranoia, the suspicion, the sur-\nveillance, the evaporation of objectivity within the sadistic vehemence of \na subjectivity bent on reproducing itself within a world it must disregard.\nMorality is thus prolongation of terror by other means. And Hegel \ngoes farther: the violence will escalate even as Kant\u2019s followers from Schil-\nler onward seek to soften the harshness of the critical project by reinject-\ning sensuousness into morality. The post-Kantian attempt to reunite the \nsubject with the world, to resituate freedom, to give it back its legs, will \nonly further deracinate it. The Romantic project converts Kantian asceti-\ncism into an aestheticism that continues cruelly to rewrite the terms of its \nown existence.\nAll this was only just starting to become visible to readers in France, \nwhere Kant somehow always managed to present an accurate barom-\neter of the political climate. Invoked vaguely as a kindred spirit during \nthe early years of the Revolution, Kant was imported almost immediately \nafter Thermidor as an agent of normalization.

Hegel illuminates the pathological within the nor-\nmal. Exaggeration reveals uncomfortable features of experience that would \nother\u00adwise be invisible. And the exaggeration itself demonstrates just what \nis most distinctive about the phenomenological method. It makes the arti-\nfice and artfulness of the whole procedure explicit: the \u201cshapes (\u00adGestalten) \nof experience\u201d are just that, constructions and fabrications, not found \nbut made\u2014fictional positions, each bearing the indelible stamp of their \nmanufacture.\nSo my intention is not to make either Kant or Hegel any more rea-\nsonable than necessary, or to correct the story, but if anything to exaggerate \nthe conflict. Four features of Hegel\u2019s argument are notable for our pur-\nposes. First, Hegel\u2019s analysis reads like a psychoanalysis. Hegel\u2019s description \nof the contortions of the moral standpoint, whatever its own distortions, \npresents a textbook collection of drives, conflicts, defenses, and symptoms, \nall pointing to a disturbance in object relations, a fundamental failure to \nsocialize, which will ultimately be the gist of Hegel\u2019s critique. Marooned in \nabstraction, the moral agent is cut off from the relationships, institutions, \nand historical traditions that nurture, constrain, and challenge it. The cat-\nalogue of Freudian concepts (and at times even vocabulary) marshaled by \nHegel throughout this section is impressive: repression, perversion, iso-\nlation, splitting, disavowal, fetishism, projection, introjection, incorpo-\nration, masochism, mourning, melancholia, repetition, death drive. But \nthere is nothing psychological or empirical about Hegel\u2019s approach. It is \nKant\u2019s logic and not his motivations that preoccupy Hegel, and the pathol-\nogy here is just the pathology of thinking itself.\nSecond, what Hegel identifies as the neuralgic points of Kantian mo-\nrality are the very points Kant himself highlights to indicate the most pro-\nfound challenges posed by his own philosophy. It does Kant no service, \nfor these purposes, to protect him from Hegel\u2019s onslaught by softening \nthe radicality of his formalism; for example, by showing how Kantian mo-\nrality might be historicized, psychologized, anthropologized, or otherwise \nbrought within the orbit of natural experience. Nor does it do Hegel any \nservice, in this context, to help him fortify his argument so that it becomes \nmore nuanced, less provocative, less strident, less, shall we say, austere.25 \nWhen such projects are undertaken, it is for other purposes; to do so here \n"

The wound is irreparable: \u201cNo matter \nhow far back we direct our attention to our moral state, we find that this \nstate is no longer res integra.\u201d26 So Kant readily concurs with Hegel: to ne-\ngotiate the abyss of freedom, nothing less than a salto mortale would be re-\nquired.27 Kant in this sense resembles either a good analysand, who accepts \nthe interpretation offered, or an infuriating one, who agrees all too readily, \ngamely conceding the analyst\u2019s point and even slyly anticipating it, while \ndoggedly persisting in his beliefs, symptoms and behavior. Like the pervert, \nhe admits to castration while remaining impervious to intervention: \u201cYes, \nI\u2019m castrated! But anyway, as I was saying . . .\u201d This is what makes the per-\nvert strictly unanalyzable. \u201cJe sais bien, mais quand m\u00eame . . .\u201d28\nThird, Hegel holds Kant responsible for all his followers (who will \nin turn merge into an undifferentiated conglomerate). The transforma-\ntion of ascetic ideology into an aesthetic ideology is already signaled, for \nHegel, in the twofold failure of Kant\u2019s own moral theory. Kant fails dou-\nbly: he initiates an impossible situation, and having done so, he fails to \nfollow through; he opens a wound he immediately proceeds to aggravate \nby applying ill-fitting sutures.

Having resorted to an imaginary solution, morality ends up cap-\ntivated by its own theatricality. The moral law swells into the splendid ex-\npression of a genius whose sole mandate is to confirm his own infinite \ncapacity for self-invention.\nFourth and finally: concealed in all this melodrama is the continu-\ning crisis of investiture that defines modernity. Spirit\u2019s inner emigration to \nthe \u201cother land\u201d of philosophical reflection has provided the last and most \nstubborn refuge for a secret inner monarch to reassert his majesty and au-\nthority over a realm of particularity whose inventory has by this point ex-\npanded to include, not only dissidents, aristocrats, and cabbages, but all \nof nature.

To \nsecure its own universality, freedom must define itself against a world of sen-\nsuous particularity, toward which it must nonetheless constantly keep turn-\ning to sustain this very self-definition. Morality is a struggle against a nature \nthat in its recalcitrance must be enlisted if only to supply the energy neces-\nsary to resist it. Duty must solicit the sensibility it suppresses, just as mo-\nrality must secretly hold out for the happiness toward which it must prove \nits indifference. My duty presupposes a gratification that it simultaneously \nprohibits. Since morality defines itself by its antagonism to natural causality, \nevery actualization is self-refuting: to be moral is to undercut the very prem-\nise of morality as such. The very success of morality would spell its terminal \ncollapse into the indifferent plenitude of transient nature. But since moral-\nity also requires a horizon of fulfillment for its coherence, it must postulate \nsuch realization as ultimately attainable\u2014but only in the \u201cdim remoteness\u201d \nof an ever-receding future in which something like jouissance is maintained, \nif only virtually or fictitiously (I\u2019ll come back to this) and at an infinite delay \n(PhG \u00a7603). Kantian morality in this way oscillates between impossibility \nand redundancy. The moral law is either unattainable or a thinly veiled but-\ntress for what is already the case anyway, and the moral agent betrays this \ncontradiction in the contortions with which it simultaneously wards off and \nincites the irrepressible demands of nature both within and without.\nHegel here effectively identifies a perverse core in duty\u2019s endless ritu-\nals of postponement. The negativity at work here is strictly speaking less \nabout repression than about disavowal. Like the fetishist who engages in \n"

The religion that was to have been con-\ntained within reason\u2019s limits is ejected as an excrescence of irrational positiv-\nity. Hegel does not hesitate to call this residue of undigested faith a kind of \nbad faith.

Hegel\u2019s Kant speaks the idiom \nof pure perversion. \u201cEnjoyment is also implied in morality\u201d (PhG \u00a7602). \nThe noncommittal \u201calso\u201d recalls the pointillist style of the \u201csophistry of \nperception.\u201d Salt can be one way and \u201calso\u201d another, both-white-and-also-\nsalty, both-one-and-also-many, both-itself-and-also-not-itself\u2014it can be, \nin fact, anything whatsoever, as long as I don\u2019t burden myself with either \ntrying to connect the dots or dwelling on the contradiction (PhG \u00a7130). \nThe pulverizing adverb \u201calso\u201d tacitly acknowledges the impossibility of the \nreconciliation to which it gestures. \u201cIt is true that there is [no moral self-\nconsciousness] yet, all the same, it is allowed . . . to pass for one\u201d (PhG \u00a7615, \nemphasis mine). \u201cJe sais bien, mais . . .\u201d\nDissemblance is to the moral worldview what skepticism had been to \nstoicism: an \u201cinsincere shuffling\u201d between irreconcilable positions whose \nconnection is systematically occluded (PhG \u00a7617). Skepticism had dis-\ntracted itself with hyperstimulation: it blunted the edge of its own nega-\ntivity by whipping it into \u201cthe dizziness of a perpetually self-engendered \ndisorder.\u201d It neutralized contradiction by turning it into idle sport. \u201c[Skep-\nticism\u2019s] talk is . . . like the squabbling of stubborn children . . . who \nby contradicting themselves buy for themselves the pleasure of continually \ncontradicting one another\u201d (PhG \u00a7205). Morality trivializes its most burn-\ning contradictions by reducing them to abstract antinomies. It buries its \nspecific negativity in \u201ca \u2018whole nest\u2019 [ein ganzes Nest] of thoughtless con-\ntradictions\u201d\u2014global, indifferent, abstract (PhG \u00a7616).

Trivial-\nization, or \u201clack of seriousness,\u201d as Hegel calls it (Romantic irony is on the \nhorizon) can be taken as a manic defense against the trauma of castration \n(PhG \u00a7617). The game is driven by a vengeful undercurrent\u2014complaints \nabout duty\u2019s own nonsatisfaction (PhG \u00a7601), envy at the happiness of the \nundeserving (PhG \u00a7625)\u2014a ressentiment that resists the most strenuous \neffort to placate or disguise it through dissembling play.\nThe postulates of practical reason allow moral reason to conceal its \nown wounds, but in so doing, it only multiplies them.

The beginning has always already begun: every blank page is \noverwritten by a network of prior mediations, every purity stained by the \nopaque contingency of a past beyond recall. Postponement is a weak de-\nfense to mask the fact that the subject has always already arrived too late. \nRomantic messianism no more fulfils the blocked promise of the Revolu-\ntion than had the overtly voluntarist projects of Kant and Fichte. Utopia \nitself is the ideological shadow cast by an existence that goes unchallenged. \n(This is the benign point behind Hegel\u2019s much-rebuked refusal, in the \nPhilosophy of Right, to \u201cinstruct the state how it ought to be,\u201d the many \nambiguities of which refusal I shall consider in the next chapter).

Incomple-\ntion is inherent in the hypertrophic drive to self-creation, and aestheticism \nculminates in an endless anesthetic of dissonant, abortive texts: from the \ndismembered body on the scaffold to the disjecta membra of the unfin-\nished work.\nHegel\u2019s well-known later critique of Jena Romanticism is already in \nplace here.

With the beautiful soul\u2019s final retreat into raging speechlessness, the \nmelancholic undercurrent of Spirit\u2019s entire trajectory becomes explicit, hy-\nperbolic, and ultimately psychotic. Reduced to pure judgment, to the crit-\nicism that exceeds and unworks the work to which it devotes itself, the \nmoral genius annihilates the world in a blaze of hatred\u2014Hyperion\u2019s spit-\nting tirade against the idiocies of \u201cmolluscan existence.\u201d71 The moral ge-\nnius refuses to reciprocate the confession that he punishingly \u00adextracts from \n"

It announces Spirit\u2019s spiral into sui-\ncidal disintegration. By exempting itself from its own moral judgment, \nthe beautiful soul disowns the common humanity that this very judgment \npresupposes; this performative contradiction announces the ultimate sin \nagainst the Spirit. Silence in this context is equivalent to the most extreme \nblasphemy. The sullen withdrawal from the speaking community marks \nthe nadir of Geistesverlassenheit, a total abandonment of and by the Holy \nSpirit, for which, biblically speaking, \u201cthere is no forgiveness either in this \nage or in the age to come\u201d (Matt. 12:32). The phantasm of the beauti-\nful new beginning is in the end, then, for Hegel, just as for Kant, the cri-\nmen inexpiabile\u2014the unforgivable transgression, which must nonetheless \nsomehow be forgiven.\nAs the beautiful soul becomes \u201cconscious of its contradiction\u201d (to \nwit, the antinomy between the universality to which it is devoted and the \nfanatic singularity of its devotion), it becomes \u201cdisordered to the point of \nmadness, wastes away in yearning and pines away in consumption\u201d (PhG \n\u00a7668). Hyperbole aside, the madness has a specific historical inflection. It \nexpresses the predicament of a subject for whom transgression is unwit-\nting, inescapable, and ineradicable. This in itself is not news; the expe-\nrience of Sittlichkeit had long established that much.72 What marks the \nspecial modernity of the experience is that guilt is now completely inter-\nnal: there is no context of fate to which my transgression can be assigned \nor into which it can be absorbed. The fissure is internal, and the abyss \nwithin. Whatever the conceptual link between \u201cmadness\u201d and \u201cconsump-\ntion\u201d\u2014between H\u00f6lderlin babbling in his tower and Novalis at his tuber-\ncular last gasp (for in these two directions the biographical signposts seem \nall irrefutably, cruelly, ludicrously to point)\u2014the association is interesting \nnot least because in both cases we are presented with an immediate con-\nvertibility of psyche and soma. Spirit collapses into the body it had repudi-\nated, which in turn wafts away with the angelic ideality of evanescent air. \nThe infinite contraction of a subjectivity withdrawn into itself (as Hegel \nlater characterizes madness) presents the mirror image of the infinite dis-\npersal of a body reduced to its elementary atomic particles so as to disap-\npear without a trace.\n"
