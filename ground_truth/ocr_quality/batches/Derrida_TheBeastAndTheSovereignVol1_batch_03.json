In short, the sovereign. In Rus-\nsian, sam (himself) names the lord. Among the Pythagoreans, the master \nPythagoras was designated as autos, autos epha: he said it himself, i.e. the \nmaster said. \u201cIn Danish han sj\u00f8lv, \u2018er selbst,\u2019 has the same meaning.\u201d The \nmaster (and what is said of the master is easily transferable to the \ufb01 rst of all, \nthe prince, the sovereign), the master is he who is said to be, and who can \nsay \u201chimself\u201d to be, the (self- )same, \u201cmyself.\u201d\nThe concept of sovereignty will always imply the possibility of this po-\nsitionality, this thesis, this self- thesis, this autoposition of him who posits or \nposits himself as ipse, the (self- )same, oneself. And that will be just as much \nthe case for all the \u201c\ufb01 rsts,\u201d for the sovereign as princely person, the monarch \nor the emperor or the dictator, as for the people in a democracy, or even \nfor the  citizen- subject in the exercise of his sovereign liberty (for example, \nwhen he votes or places his secret ballot in the box, sovereignly). In sum, \nwherever there is a decision worthy of the name, in the classical sense of the \nterm. Dictatorship (and in a minimal and strict sense sovereignty is always \na moment of dictatorship, even if one does not live in a so- called dictatorial \nregime) is always the essence of sovereignty, where it is linked to the power \nto say in the form of dictation, prescription, order or diktat. From the Ro-\nman dictatura, where the dictator is the supreme and extraordinary magis-\ntrate, sometimes the \ufb01 rst magistrate, and so the master of certain cities, to \nmodern forms of dictatorship such as F\u00fchrer or Duce or the Little Father \nof the People or some other \u201cpapadoc,\u201d6 but also in the \ufb01 gure of the dicta-\ntorship of the proletariat, in dictatorship in general as power that exercises \nitself unconditionally in the form of the Diktat, of the ultimate saying or the \nperformative verdict that gives orders and has no account to render other \nthan to itself (ipse), and not to any superior agency, especially not a par-\nliament \u2014 well, that dictatorship, that dictatorial agency, is at work every-\nwhere, wherever there is sovereignty.\n6. [Translator\u2019s note:] Derrida is here referring to Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier \n(1904\u201371), the notorious dictatorial president of Haiti from 1957 until his death.\n103 \n"

In passing, Deleuze \nmakes fun of psychoanalysis when it talks about animals, makes fun as he \noften does, sometimes a little hastily, and not only does he make fun of it but \nhe says, which is even funnier, that the animals themselves make fun of it. \nThis is on pages 294\u201395 [240\u201341] of Mille plateaux:\nWe would even have to distinguish three sorts of animals: individuated \nanimals, familiar and familial, sentimental, Oedipal animals, part of our \nlittle story, \u201cmy\u201d cat, \u201cmy\u201d dog; they invite us to regress, they draw us into \nnarcissistic contemplation, and psychoanalysis understands only these ani-\nmals, the better to discover underneath the image of a Daddy, a Mommy, a \nlittle brother (when psychoanalysis talks about animals, the animals learn \nto laugh); all the people who love cats and dogs are idiots [des cons]. And then \nthere would be a second sort, animals with character or attribute, animals of \ngenus, classi\ufb01 cation, or state, the way the great divine myths treat them, to \nextract from them series or structures, archetypes or models (Jung is more \nprofound than Freud, though). Finally, there would be more demoniacal \nanimals, with packs and affects, and who produce multiplicity, becoming, \npopulation, fairy tale . . . Or else, once more, is it not all animals that can \nbe treated these three ways? There will always be the possibility that any \nanimal, louse, cheetah, or elephant, be treated as a familiar animal, my little \nanimal. And, at the other extreme, any animal can also be treated after the \nmanner of pack and swarming, which suits us sorcerers better. Even the \ncat, even the dog . . . And if the shepherd or the leader of the pack, the devil \nhave his favorite animal in the pack, this is certainly not in the same way as \njust now. Yes, any animal is or can be a pack, but with varying degrees of \nvocation for it, which makes it more or less easy to discover the multiplicity, \nthe tenor in multiplicity, that it contains actually or virtually in each case. \nBanks, bands, \ufb02 ocks, populations are not inferior social forms, they are af-\nfects and potentials, involutions, which catch up all animals in a becoming \nthat is no less powerful than that of man with animal.\nAnd of course the question that will traverse this whole seminar, whether it \nbe itself present and pressing, itself, explicitly, in person, or indirectly, will \nalways be that of the \u201cproper to man.\u201d And, moreover, bestiality, character-\nized either as perversion or sexual deviancy, zoophilia that pushes people to \nmake love with beasts or to make love to beasts, or as cruelty \u2014 this bestial-\nity, this double bestiality (zoophilic or cruel) would also be proper to man. \nAnd later we shall look closely at a text of Lacan\u2019s on this subject (bestial \ncruelty as proper to man).\n105 \n"

I\u2019m careful to say the sovereignty of the state and the \n nation- state, for the humanity of man or of the human person invoked by \nhuman rights or the concept of crime against humanity, by international \nright or the international penal agencies \u2014 all these agencies might well be \ninvoking another sovereignty, the sovereignty of man himself, of the very \nbeing of man himself (ipse, ipsissimus) above and beyond and before state or \n nation- state sovereignty.\nIt is, moreover, let it be said in passing, this invocation of the human, the \nhumanitarian, or even of human rights \u2014 above the state \u2014 that Schmitt \nholds to be de- politicizing, to be responsible for the modern neutralization \nof the political or for depoliticization (Entpolitisierung). In truth, and this is \nwhy I say \u201cinvocation\u201d of the human or the humanitarian above the interest \nof the state, Schmitt believes he can always discern in this humanistic and \nhumanitarian discourse a ruse of war, a strategic ruse put to work by a state \nstruggling for hegemony, the ruse of a wolf, a werewolf, if not of a fox (let us \nnever forget the wolves and the foxes). Depoliticization, the move beyond \nstate sovereignty would on this view be a piece of hypocrisy in the service \nof a sovereignty, of a determinate  nation- state hegemony. Schmitt, in the \n1930s, is not yet speaking of \u201cglobalization [mondialisation: worldwidiza-\ntion],\u201d but this is clearly what he has in view in his critique of the premises \nof a new international right, a Society of nations, etc. The world of global-\nization would then be a stratagem, a false concept or a concept forged in or-\nder to pass off some particular interest as a worldwide or universal interest, \npass off the interest of one  nation- state or a restricted group of  nation- states \nas the world, as the universal interest of humanity in general, as the interest \nof the proper of man in general. After having asserted that \u201chumanity as \nsuch [Die Menschheit als solche] cannot wage war because it has no enemy, \nat least on this planet [comment on this last detail]. The concept of human-\nity excludes the concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease \nto be human being \u2014 and hence there is no speci\ufb01 c differentiation in that \nconcept\u201d10 \u2014 after having asserted this, i.e. that the concept of humanity \ncannot be a political concept or the basis for a politics, Schmitt goes on to try \nto show that in fact, wherever this concept is put forward in the pursuit of \nwar (and there would be so many examples today), it is a lying rhetoric, an \nideological disguise tending to mask and smuggle in  nation- state interests, \n10.

This argument of Schmitt\u2019s, and this is all I want to \nretain from it for now, is that there is no politics, no politicity of the political \nwithout af\ufb01 rmation of sovereignty, that the privileged if not unique form \nof that sovereignty is the state, state sovereignty, and that such a political \nsovereignty in the form of the state presupposes the determination of an \nenemy; and this determination of the enemy can in no case take place, by \nde\ufb01 nition, in the name of humanity. The concept of this sovereignty which \nnever goes without an enemy, which needs the enemy to be what it is, is not \nnecessarily linked or limited to such or such a state structure (monarchi-\ncal, oligarchical, democratic, or republican). Even when the sovereign is the \npeople or the nation, this does not damage the law, structure, or vocation of \nsovereignty, as Schmitt de\ufb01 nes it (the positing of an enemy without human-\nist or humanitarian invocation; the right to exception; the right to suspend \nright; the right to be outside the law).\nThis is why Schmitt will have quoted, before the passage I just read, an \neloquent declaration in this respect by the Committee for Public Safety, in \n1793. This declaration, quoted by Schmitt, is \ufb01 rst quoted by Ernst Friesen-\nhahn <in> Der politische Eid (The Political Oath). (I recall this title to re-\ninscribe this statement in a logic of the oath that makes of the af\ufb01 rmation \nof sovereignty a performative, a commitment, an act of sworn faith, of war \ndeclared against a sworn enemy: sovereignty is a posited law, a thesis or \na prosthesis, and not a natural given, it is the sworn institution \u2014 a faith \nsworn, and therefore structurally \ufb01 ctional, \ufb01 gural, invented, conventional, \nas Hobbes clearly shows, moreover \u2014 the institution of a law that was never \nfound in nature; but precisely the question then returns of the link between \nthis right, the force of law and force tout court, the disposition of force tout \ncourt, of a force that makes right, of a reason of the strongest which is or \nis not the best; but I emphasize this reference to oath and \ufb01 delity to sworn \nfaith to announce a detour that we shall need to make in a moment, toward \nMachiavelli\u2019s Prince and his wolf \u2014 that we must not forget).

You\u2019ll see the wolf go by, but also more composite ani-\nmals. The question of the proper of man is indeed placed at the center of a \ndebate about the force of law, between force and law. In this chapter, which \npasses for one of the most Machiavellian in Machiavelli, he begins by admit-\nting a fact (I stress the word fact): in fact, de facto, one judges praise worthy \nthe \ufb01 delity of a prince to his commitments. It is praiseworthy, one must \nagree. After what looks like a concession (yes, it\u2019s good, it\u2019s praiseworthy, \nit\u2019s a recognized fact that, in principle, by rights, a prince ought to keep his \nword), Machiavelli comes back to the fact, which in fact he has never left. \nIt is a fact that everyone regards the \ufb01 delity of the prince to his given word \nas laudable, but, in fact, few princes are faithful, few princes respect their \ncommitments, and most of them use cunning: they almost all use cunning \nwith their commitments. For they are constrained, in fact, to do so. We saw, \nhe says, we have been in a position to see that the strongest princes, those \nwho won out, beat those who, on the contrary, took as a rule the respect of \ntheir oath (this is why I announced a while ago that I would talk about the \noath).\nMachiavelli\u2019s rhetoric is remarkable, as is his logic. For after having noted \nthis fact (the nonrespect of the oath that wins in fact, perjury that wins de \nfacto, cunning that in reality beats \ufb01 delity), he concludes from this fact, al-\nways in the constative and realistic regime, that political reason must take \naccount and render account of this fact. Political reason must count and cal-\nculate with the fact that, in fact, there are two ways to \ufb01 ght. Following para-\ngraph, then: \u201cThere are two kinds of combat: one with laws, the other with \nforce\u201d (p. 69). The old Giraudet translation [as is the case in the En glish \none by Mans\ufb01 eld] accentuates this constative regime, which is the regime of \ntheoretical knowledge, of the factual description of what one must know, of \nthe  knowledge- of- what- one- needs- to- know: \u201cYou should then know [Ma-\nchiavelli is addressing Lorenzo de Medicis as much as the reader] that there \nare two ways of combating, one with laws, the other with force.\u201d\nSo sometimes with right, justice, \ufb01 delity, respect for the laws, contracts, \n123 \n"

Combat with laws (and so according to \ufb01 delity to \none\u2019s commitments, as a sincere prince respectful of the laws) is, he says, \nproper to man. These are his words (\u201cproper to man\u201d), a Kantian argument \nin its principle, as it were: not to lie, to have the duty not to lie or perjure, is \nproper to man and his dignity. When one lies, when one betrays, which one \ncan always do, in fact one is not speaking as a man, not as a man worthy of \nhuman dignity [digne de la dignit\u00e9 humaine]; in fact, one is not speaking, one \nis not addressing the other as a man, as another man. One is not speaking \nto one\u2019s fellow man [son semblable] (hold on to this value of semblable which \nwill occupy us a great deal later). But what comes next in Machiavelli, who \nis not here speaking from an ethical point of view but from a political point \nof view, and who is measuring the possibility of the political, the law of \nthe political against the test of war \u2014 what comes next in Machiavelli\u2019s dis-\ncourse is, as we might expect, less Kantian. The second way to combat, \nhe says (combat with force) is that of beasts. No longer man but the beast. \nForce and not law, the reason of the strongest, is what is proper to the beast. \nAfter this second moment, Machiavelli notes in a third moment of the argu-\nmentation that, in fact, the \ufb01 rst way to combat (with the law) is insuf\ufb01 cient, \nand remains, in fact, impotent. So one must, in fact, resort to the other. \nThus the prince must combat with both weapons, both law and force. He \nmust then behave both as man and as beast. \u201cTherefore it is necessary for a \nprince to know how to use as appropriate the beast and the man\u201d (p. 69; trans-\nlation modi\ufb01 ed; Derrida\u2019s emphasis).

The pedagogical import is itself double and touches doubly on \nthis  quasi- double nature of the prince, who must act as if he were at once \nman and beast. Pedagogy in the \ufb01 rst place because that is, Machiavelli tells \nus, what the writers of antiquity teach and have taught us. And this teach-\ning will have taken an allegorical form (that is Machiavelli\u2019s word). It is by \nallegory or \u201canimal\u201d fabulation, the better to be heard, that these ancient \nwriters called in animal \ufb01 gures.

The Kentauros was a hybrid being, born of Kentauros and \nThessalian mares: a huge history to which I refer you. One could devote \nmore than one seminar to it. There is a book by Dum\u00e9zil on the problem \nof centaurs (1929).19\nTo remain with the minimum that matters to us here, I recall that cen-\ntaurs (often represented, in their double \u2014 human and animal \u2014 nature by \nthe articulation of a human front (human trunk and face) and an equine \nrear, in a horizontal order, then, not vertical, front and rear and not top and \nbottom) also present another ambiguity, besides that of the human and the \n(equine) animal. For they are both savages, savage beasts (ther), barbarian, \nterribly natural and, on the other hand, civilizing heroes, masters, peda-\ngogues, initiators into the most diverse domains, skillful with their hands \n(the name Chiron allegedly comes from cheir, hand, whence surgery, and \ncentaurs have not only human trunk and face but also human arms and \nhands), initiators, then, in the art of hunting, and hence cynegetics, music, \nmedicine, etc. On the one hand, they represent the most asocial savagery, \nand Apollodorus will say of them that they are \u201csavage, without social or-\n19.

It \u201churts,\u201d says \none of the recommendations of the Stratcom, to depict ourselves as fully \nrational and cool. It is \u201cbene\ufb01 cial,\u201d to the contrary, for our strategy to have \ncertain elements appear to be \u201cout of control.\u201d\n2. For Machiavelli, in the passage we have just read, cunning does not \nsuf\ufb01 ce, one also needs force, and therefore extra animality: \u201cif he [the prince] \nis only fox, he will not defend himself from wolves.\u201d Which means that, be-\ning stronger, the lion is also more b\u00eate, more of a beast than the fox, who is \nmore intelligent, more cunning, but weaker, and so more human than the \nlion. There is a hierarchy here: man, fox, lion, going from the more human, \nthe more rational and intelligent, to the more animal, even the more bes-\ntial, if not to the more b\u00eate. Precisely because he knows how to be cunning, \nhow to lie, how to commit perjury, because he has the sense and culture of \nthe snare, the fox is closer to the truth of man and man\u2019s \ufb01 delity, which he \nunderstands and knows how to invert. The fox can be cunning and unfaith-\nful; he knows how to betray, whereas the lion does not even understand the \nopposition of faithful and unfaithful, veracity and lying. The fox is more \nhuman than the lion.\n3. The privilege of the fox is therefore clear in this princely alliance of \nthe lion and the fox against the wolves.

I was preached against from the pulpit, called the antichrist, and \npursued across the countryside like a werewolf. My Armenian dress gave \nme away to the populace: I cruelly felt the drawback it represented, but \ntaking it off in these circumstances seemed cowardice to me. I could not \nresolve to do it, and walked calmly abroad with my kaftan and fur bon-\nnet surrounded by the cries of the rabble and sometimes its stones. Several \ntimes as I walked past a house, I heard the inhabitants saying: bring me my \ngun so I can shoot him.7\nCruelty, then, criminality, being outside the (religious or civil) law, being \nwithout faith or law, that\u2019s what characterizes, not the wolf itself, but the \nwerewolf, the wolf- man, the lycanthrope, the mad or sick man. This cru-\nelty of the \u201cwithout faith or law\u201d would then be proper to man, that bestial-\nity that is attributed to man and causes him to be compared to a beast, and \napparently also proper to man in that he presupposes the law, even when he \nopposes it, whereas the beast itself, even if it can be violent and ignore the \nlaw, cannot, in this classical logic, be held to be bestial. Like b\u00eatise, bestiality, \nbestial cruelty would thus be proper to man.

My hypothesis is that Lacan\u2019s discourse \nplays this double role.\nBefore broadening and gradually diversifying our references to the La-\ncanian corpus, I shall take as my starting point a noteworthy article in the \n\u00c9crits entitled \u201cFunctions of Psychoanalysis in Criminology\u201d (1950),8 which \nI invite you to read in its entirety.\nLacan begins by recalling something that is very classical and tradi-\ntional, however novel it may look under his pen. What? Lacan begins by \ndeclaring that what is proper to man, the origin of man, the place where \nhumanity begins, is the Law, the relation to the Law (with a capital L). In \nother words, what separates Man from Beast is the Law, the experience \nof the Law, the Superego, and therefore the possibility of transgressing it \nin Crime. Basically, as opposed to the Beast, Man can obey or not obey the \nLaw. Only he has that liberty. Only he, then, can become criminal. The \nbeast can kill and do what seems to us bad or wicked but will never be \nheld to be criminal, never be incriminated, one cannot have a beast appear \nbefore the law (even though that has happened, and we need to remember \nthat fact, but let\u2019s leave it for now). Lacan is here on the side of a certain \ncommon sense, according to which the beast, ignorant of the Law, is not \nfree, neither responsible nor culpable, cannot transgress a Law it does not \nknow, cannot be held to be criminal. A beast never commits a crime and is \nnever in infraction of the law. Which means that Crime, as transgression \nof the Law, would be proper to man. With Law and Crime, man begins. \nI quote:\nOne imagines that having received in psychology such an input from the \nsocial, Freud the doctor should have been tempted to give something back, \nand that with Totem and Taboo in 1912, he should have wished to demon-\nstrate in the primordial crime the origin of the universal Law. However \nsubject to methodological criticism this work may be, the important thing \nis that it recognized that with Law and Crime begins man, after the cli-\nnician had shown that their meanings supported everything down to the \nform of the individual not only in his value for the other, but in his erection \nfor himself.\n \nThus the conception of the superego saw the light of day.9\n8.

What Lacan immediately im-\nplies with this distinction between acquired and innate is that the animal \n(as he says everywhere else, as we shall see) is con\ufb01 ned to this \ufb01 xity of the \ninnate, innate wiring or programming, whereas man, in his relation to the \nlaw (and therefore to crime), is not so con\ufb01 ned. Always the question of \nliberty and the machine. The question, then, is indeed the old question of \nthe innate and the acquired. Not that, for Lacan, there can be no \ufb01 xed and \nanimal instinct in man: of course there is an animality in man, but crime, \ncruelty, and ferocity do not come from instinct, they transcend animality, \nthey assume not merely a \u201cliberty\u201d and a \u201cresponsibility,\u201d and therefore a \n\u201cpeccability\u201d (words that Lacan is careful not to pronounce here, but with \nrespect to which we shall see later that the corresponding and indissociable \nconcepts, especially those of response and responsibility, play a decisive role), \nthese statements also assume that clarity has been achieved with respect to a \nword that Lacan not only puts forward twice, but that here literally desig-\nnates the major criterion: namely the word \u201cfellow\u201d [semblable].\nWhat is supposed to distinguish man, as \u201cwolf for man,\u201d from the animal, \nwhat is supposed to distinguish the wolf- man or the werewolf from the ani-\nmal, and thus from the wolf itself, what is supposed to distinguish human \ncruelty or ferocity from all animal violence \u2014 animal violence to which one \ncannot consequently give the attribute of cruelty (only man is cruel, the \nanimal can harm, but it cannot do evil for evil and so be cruel) \u2014 what is \nsupposed to distinguish cruel humanity from non- cruel (and therefore in-\nnocent) animality is that the cruel man attacks his fellow, which the animal \nsupposedly does not. So it is this notion of \u201cfellow\u201d which will carry the \nwhole burden of the demonstration (which is, moreover, as classical and \ntraditional as can be, in my view) by which Lacan intends to correct the \nerror he supposes has been made in the interpretation of homo homini lupus \n(\u201cthe form of the adage,\u201d he says and I recall, \u201cmisleads as to its meaning\u201d), \nan error that supposedly would consist in believing that man is a wolf, and \nthus an animal for man, which Lacan is about to contest.

      "full_text": "106  \u2021  fourth session\nsee them cannot and should not stop there; and it is the whole Lacanian and \neven psychoanalytical axiomatic that would need to be recast.\nI shall for the moment limit myself to bringing out three points from this \nparticular passage. But they are three points that will constantly, when we \nread other texts of Lacan\u2019s, tie in with an immense discursive woof or warp \nthat seems to me to be problematic through and through.\n1. First, the distinction between the innate and the acquired, and thus be-\ntween instinct and everything that goes with \u201cculture,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d \u201cinstitution,\u201d \n\u201cfreedom,\u201d etc., has always been fragile, <and> is more fragile than ever \ntoday, exactly like the presupposition of an animality deprived of language, \nhistory, culture, technique, relation to death as such, and the transmission of \nacquired knowledge. I am one of those \u2014 it is true that there are not many \nof us \u2014 who have always smiled at this machine of presuppositions to be \ndeconstructed. But it happens moreover that the most positive science to-\nday (see the recently published book on the origins of man (Coppens???))16 \nshows that some animals (not that hypostatic \ufb01 ction labeled The Animal, \nof course, but some among those that are classi\ufb01 ed as animals) have a his-\ntory and techniques, and thus a culture in the most rigorous sense of the \nterm, i.e. precisely, the transmission and accumulation of knowledge and \nacquired capacities. And where there is transgenerational transmission, \nthere is law, and therefore crime and peccability.\n2. Saying that cruelty is essentially human because it consists in caus-\ning suffering to one\u2019s fellow comes down to giving an exorbitant credit to \nthis value of the fellow. Even more so if we say that when one is cruel to \nanother species, it is still one\u2019s fellow that one is targeting. Even when one is \ncruel with respect to this or that animal, Lacan is basically suggesting, it is \na man one is targeting \u2014 a fertile hypothesis and one no doubt to be taken \nseriously, but which does not prove that all cruelty with respect to one\u2019s \nnon- fellow [dissemblable] is immediately rendered innocent because what it \nis targeting in truth and at bottom is still the fellow, man targeted through \nthe animal. How does one recognize a fellow? Is the \u201cfellow\u201d only what has \nhuman form, or is it anything that is alive? And if it is the human form of \nlife, what will be the criteria for identifying it without implying a whole de-\nterminate culture, for example European, Greco- Abrahamic culture, and \nin particular Christian culture, which installs the value of \u201cneighbor\u201d or \n\u201cbrother\u201d in the universality of the world, as totality of all creatures? And \nI point out that Lacan ends this article with a reference, in spite of every-\n16. Question marks in the typescript. The allusion is to Aux origines de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, ed. \nYves Coppens and Pascal Picq (Paris: Fayard, 2002).\n \n152\n \n153\n"

Especially to an \u201ceternal fraternity\u201d \u2014 which I \nsaid a moment ago ran the risk of being overcon\ufb01 dent. But Lacan, as he re-\ncalls earlier in the same article, does not forget the murderous violence that \nwill have presided over the establishment of the law, namely the murder \nof the father, thanks to which (thanks to the murder, thanks to the father, \nthanks to the murder of the father) the guilty and shameful sons come to \ncontract, through a sort of at least tacit oath or sworn faith, the equality of \nthe brothers. The trace of this founding criminality or this primitive crime, \nthe memory of which is kept by the (animal) totem and the taboo \u2014 this \nmurderous trace remains ineffaceable in any egalitarian, communitarian, \nand compassional fraternity, in this primitive contract that makes of any \ncompassional community a cofraternity.\nThere remains the immense risk of what is still a fraternalism of the \u201cfel-\nlow.\u201d This risk is double (and also affects L\u00e9vinas\u2019s discourse, let it be said \nin passing): on the one hand, this fraternalism frees us from all ethical obli-\ngation, all duty not to be criminal and cruel, precisely, with respect to any \nliving being that is not my fellow or is not recognized as my fellow, because \nit is other and other than man. In this logic, one is never cruel toward what \nis called an animal, or a nonhuman living creature. One is already excul-\npated of any crime toward any nonhuman living being. And specifying, on \nthe other hand, as Lacan does: \u201cIt is a fellow that it [this cruelty] is targeting, \neven in a being of another species,\u201d does not change or \ufb01 x anything. It is \nalways my fellow that I am targeting in a being of another species. So the \nfact remains that I cannot be suspected of cruelty with respect to an animal \n17.

One will say that this is a fact (but can a fact ground \nand justify an ethics?): it is a fact that I feel, in this order, more obligations \ntoward those who closely share my life, my people, my family, the French, \nthe Europeans, those who speak my language or share my culture, etc. But \nthis fact will never have founded a right, an ethics, or a politics.\n3. Finally, if we rely on Lacan\u2019s axiomatics or good sense, once there is \ncruelty only toward the fellow, well, not only can one cause hurt without \ndoing evil [faire du mal sans faire le mal] and without being cruel not only \ntoward humans not recognized as true humans and true brothers (I leave \nthe choice of examples up to you, and this is not only about racism), but \nalso toward any living being foreign to the human race. The obvious con-\nsequence is that not only would one not be cruel (or criminal, criminaliz-\nable, or culpable) when one caused suffering to people not recognized and \nlegitimized as such (which happens every day somewhere in the world), \nbut one would have the right to in\ufb02 ict the worst suffering on \u201canimals\u201d \nwithout ever being suspected of the least cruelty. There would be no cruelty \nin industrial abattoirs, in the most horri\ufb01 c stockbreeding establishments, \nin bull\ufb01 ghts, in dissections, experimentations, breaking and training, etc., \nin circuses, menageries, and zoos (of which more soon). I need not belabor \nthe point.\nHere, two corollaries that are also two virtual complications of this schema.\nA. First complication. One might object to my objection (so this is an ob-\njection I\u2019m making to myself and that I will try my best to integrate and \ntake into account) that what I am doing is simply an almost limitless broad-\nening of the notion of \u201cfellow\u201d and that in talking about the dissimilar, \nthe non- fellow, I am surreptitiously extending the similar, the fellow, to all \nforms of life, to all species. All animals qua living beings are my fellows. I \naccept this counterproposition, but not without twice further upping the \nante by pointing out:\n1. In the \ufb01 rst place, the \ufb01 rst upping of the ante: that this broadening would \nalready, of itself, be markedly, signi\ufb01 cantly, and obviously in breach with ev-\nerything that everyone has in mind, and Lacan in particular, when they talk \nabout the fellow: fellow means for them, as is undeniably obvious, not \u201cliv-\ning being in general\u201d but \u201cliving being with a human face.\u201d There is here an \nuncrossable qualitative limit; I mean a qualitative and essential limit. To put \nthis limit to the test of the worst experimentations, it is enough to imagine (I \nleave you to do so) a thousand situations in which one would have to decide \nwhich life goes \ufb01 rst \u2014 before the other. According to the humanist logic the \npresupposition of which we are trying to think through, saving a human \n156 \n157\n"
