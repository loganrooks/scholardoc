Never could I have imag-\nined such acute, thoughtful, and generous readers. I am profoundly grateful \nfor the probing comments, friendship, and inspiring examples of Ian \u00adBalfour, \nAndrew Cutrofello, Daniel Heller-Roazen, Lyndal Roper, and Nick \u00adStargardt, \nwho all read the manuscript at various stages. I owe particular thanks to Ma-\nrina Vitkin, who commented on the manuscript repeatedly with her inimi-\ntable rigor and subtlety, and to Jay Bernstein, for penetrating comments and \nalways bracing discussion. Above all I thank Cary Fagan, for unforgettable \nconversations, writerly acuity, and for help in every way and every day.\nMany of these ideas were first explored in the classroom, and I thank my \namazing students in Toronto, Buffalo, and Princeton who inspired me hugely. \nPortions of the writing were done while holding visiting appointments in \nthe Comparative Literature Department at the University of Buffalo and the \nGerman Department at Princeton, where I also had the good fortune to be a \nvisiting fellow in the Humanities Council; I am particularly grateful for the \nhospitality of Rodolphe Gasch\u00e9, Shaun Irlam, and Susan Varney while I was \nat Buffalo, and Mike Jennings, Eduardo Cadava and Tori McGeer at Prince\u00ad\nton. And I am deeply appreciative of the ongoing support of my colleagues at \nthe University of Toronto\u2014in particular Eric Cazdyn, Julian \u00adPatrick, Donald \nAinslie, and Bob Gibbs. The editorial team at Stanford University Press made \nthe publication process as blissfully efficient as the writing process was not, \nand I am especially grateful to my editors, Emily-Jane Cohen and Mariana \nRaykov, and to Peter Dreyer for his meticulous copyediting. Thanks also to \nKarin Nisenbaum for her careful work preparing the index, and to Emilio \nComay del Junco for help preparing the final manuscript. \nBut this owes most of all to the generosity and exuberance of those \nwho lived with it\u2014above all to Emilio and Yoyo, who were there from the \nvery beginning (this is for you, to remember the times in Berlin and Paris, \nand for all the other times too), and to Cary, Sophie, and Rachel, who came \nalong in the middle and transformed my life.\n"

Gazing across the Rhine at the chaos and carnage, Ger-\nman philosophy congratulates itself for having preempted such turmoil on \nits own soil.

Having long established \nits own brand of radicalism in the form of the Protestant Reformation, \nGermany has already outstripped, at a spiritual level, anything the French \ncould accomplish in practical terms.\nHaving successfully gone through its own upheaval, Germany recog-\nnizes its own image in the French revolutionary struggle and is poised to \nextract from the Revolution an energy blocked to those caught up in its \nwhirl. This affinity allows it to affirm solidarity with the Revolution and \neven to enjoy a vicarious thrill in its terrors, while managing to soften its \nultimate impact. Germany lays claim to the revolutionary legacy even as \nit denies any immediate link to the event. By insisting on its own radical \npedigree, it is able to position itself as the French Revolution\u2019s predecessor, \nsuccessor, and most faithful contemporary.

Mis\u00e8re (the word, with its majuscule, \nis strictly speaking neither French nor German) stands here above all for \na historical discordance. The Revolution not only highlights the startling \ncontrast between the breathtaking modernity of France and the general de-\ncrepitude of a Germany still mired in the swamplands of feudal absolut-\nism\u2014the various political, social, economic, and technological delays that \nseem to consign it to the backwaters of history\u2014\u201ca dusty fact in the his-\ntorical lumber-room of modern nations.\u201d1 It also throws into relief a persis-\ntent misalignment both between and within the various strands of German \nexperience\u2014a blend of intellectual precocity and political retardation that \nsets the pace for its peculiar transition to modernity. \u201cWe are the philosophi-\ncal contemporaries of the modern age without being its historical contem-\nporaries,\u201d Marx comments.2 This discrepancy between theoretical audacity \nand practical docility\u2014intense philosophical intimacy with an event that is \nregarded as either politically repugnant or pragmatically unthinkable\u2014re-\nveals far more than ambivalence, inconsistency, hypocrisy, or the regression \nof German culture from the lofty heights of speculation into \u201cbeer-\u00adswilling \nphilistinism.\u201d3 (This last insult was recurrent in the radical literature of \nthe 1840s, as the forces of repression and censorship swelled, revolutionary \nhopes sagged, and the cosmopolitan ambitions of German idealism gave \nway to virulent forms of nationalism and parochial self-\u00adinterest. \u201cA Ger-\nman\u2019s patriotism,\u201d writes Heine, \u201cmeans that his heart contracts and shrinks \nlike leather in the cold.\u201d)4 The discrepancy points to a seemingly incorri-\ngible temporal slippage. German history scans as a dissonant counter\u00adpoint \nof divergent rhythms running along separate tracks, each set to a different \ntempo and a different beat. Racing forever ahead of an event to which it \ncan never catch up, forever Achilles to the tortoise, Germany, around 1800, \npresents the perfect model of historical nonsynchronicity.\n"

Anach-\nronism is its signature: experience is continually outbidding itself, perpetu-\nally making demands that it (i.e., the world) is unequipped to realize and \nunprepared to recognize, and comprehension inevitably comes too late to \nmake a difference, if only because the stakes have already changed. Abso-\nlute knowing is the exposition of this delay. Its mandate is to make explicit \nthe structural dissonance of experience. If philosophy makes any claim to \nuniversality, this is not because it synchronizes the calendars or provides \nintellectual compensation for its own tardiness. Its contribution is rather \nto formalize the necessity of the delay, together with the inventive strate-\ngies with which such a delay itself is invariably disguised, ignored, glamor-\nized, or rationalized.\nThis is why, for Hegel, the French Revolution will remain a \u201cknot\u201d \n(Philosophy of History)\u2014it leaves a residue for future generations. Although \nmy reading differs from conventional readings that deplore the capacious-\nness of absolute knowing\u2014its ability to absorb and profit from the most \nrecalcitrant material (evil, idiocy, excrement, etc.)\u2014it is not my ambition \nto point to some kind of inassimilable remainder to the system, a moment \nof excess or exteriority to reason. My aim is rather to explore the ways in \nwhich the seeming exception constitutes the norm: revolutionary negativ-\nity is simultaneously a limit to experience and its paradigmatic logic. This \nis why the French Revolution appears at once unbridgeably distant and \nuncannily familiar.\nPhilosophy diagnoses the \u201cGerman misery\u201d even as it inevitably per-\npetuates it. Hegel shares the usual fantasies of his epoch, but adds a dose \nof clarity and critique to the ideological brew. This is what makes him sin-\ngularly interesting among his contemporaries. He shows how a fantasy can \nbe simultaneously enjoyed and deconstructed. In the long-awaited (and \nstrangely anticlimactic) finale of the \u201cSpirit\u201d chapter in the Phenomenol-\nogy\u2014this will be the topic of my final chapter\u2014thinking will be forced to \nconfront the costs of its own lateness.\nHegel\u2019s philosophy thus poses an immediate challenge. How to con-\nceptualize lateness without assuming the stable reference point of a uni-\nform and continuous time frame from which to take the measure of the \ndelay? The issue is normative: can the concept of delay be thought without \nintroducing a linear, additive, progressive\u2014in every way outdated\u2014model \n"

The specific resistance to the French language \neasily goes back to a reaction against the prestige of French in eighteenth-\u00ad\ncentury German court culture, while a more general antipathy to things \nLatin dates at least from the Reformation. Luther\u2019s translation of the Vul-\ngate had explicitly set out to liberate the living spirit of Scripture from the \ndeadly literalism of the Roman Catholic Church. The very idea of Ger-\nmanness, Deutschheit, was already linked here to the proto-Enlightenment \nideal of clarity and accessibility, Deutlichkeit\u2014a publicity bound to the im-\nmediacy of oral speech and to the open circulation of street and market.3 \nWe might say that Deutschheit supplied the radiant middle term between \nthe luminous poles of religion (Revelation) and reason (Enlightenment).\nBy the time Campe issued his salvo, the revolutionary wars were \nraging, and Germany\u2019s situation was perilous. \u201cGermany is a state no \nmore,\u201d Hegel would announce within a few years, adding that actually, \nstrictly speaking, it never had been a state, not a real one, not a nation \nto live or die for, that it lacked the essential drive to unity, that at least \nsince the Peace of Westphalia, if not before, the German nation had been \nin a condition of \u201corganized statelessness\u201d\u2014a lifeless aggregate, a heap of \nstones\u2014ravaged by its obdurate individualism, political fragmentation, \nand centrifugal tendency to dispersion.4 This had been a common theme \nwell before 1800.

For one rapturous year, he had \nrelayed his impressions in a widely read series of open letters published \nin the liberal Braunschweiger Journal. Campe describes himself repeatedly \nas swimming against the current\u2014pushing against a barrage of warnings \nfrom friends and family and even against his own initial sense of revulsion \nas he forces his way through the dank and depressing outskirts of Paris to-\nward the effervescent city center. He describes the Revolution as an irre-\nsistible flood sweeping aside ossified ideas and structures, and transforming \nFrenchmen overnight into virtuous Greeks and Romans.\nBy 1792, the tide had turned, the roads of Europe were swarming \nwith \u00e9migr\u00e9s, refugees, and soldiers, the flood had begun to erode lin-\nguistic as well as geographical boundaries, and the German language was \nawash with foreign borrowings. Meanwhile, back in Paris, the slaughter \nhad begun, and Campe, like most of his compatriots, had long decamped \nfrom the scene. His manifesto of 1792 is itself a testimony to the irre-\nsistibility of the French attraction, and not simply by virtue of its pas-\nsionate intensity.

The strange rigor of Campe\u2019s proposal derives in large part from \nthe French idea of sovereignty, with its norm of homogeneity, transpar-\nency, and legibility, and exhibits the general ambiguity of German cul-\ntural nationalism around 1800: how to construct an autonomy forged in \nthe image of the oppressor?\nBy 1806, Napoleon\u2019s army would have conquered the territories on \nboth sides of the Rhine, annexed Austria and Prussia, and put an official \nend to the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire and thus to Germany\u2019s \nsymbolic claim, such as it was, to world-historical significance. The stakes \nhad mounted. A year after the battle of Jena, Campe issues a second mani-\nfesto. If the French troops cannot be ejected, the Germans can at least take \na cue from their example; they can turn back the invasion of foreign words \nthat have burrowed through the ramparts of the German language, and \nextract from the restored transparency of their own language a consoling \nimage of national integrity.

Luther had ignited the first spark of a conflagration from whose \nflames Germany might, from a safe distance, continue to draw warmth. Im-\nmune to the virus of revolution, Germany can become its sublime carrier.\nGermany thus sets out to quarantine the political threat of revolu-\ntion while siphoning off its intensity for thought: crisis is harnessed to \nthe project of critical critique. Around 1800, the Reformation is explicitly \ntethered to the agenda of preemptive cultural reform. Political revolution \nmight be forestalled by a \u201ctotal revolution in sensibility\u201d (Schiller), a \u201crev-\nolution in thinking\u201d (Kant)\u2014a radical reversal of orientation and agency \nin the light of which literal inversions of power in the social world seem at \nonce catastrophic\u2014bloodthirsty, barbaric\u2014and in the end curiously inef-\nfective. In this light, the French Revolution is seen to be at once far too \ngrandiose and far too modest: risking everything, it dares nothing. What \nmight appear as rapturous upheaval and rupture is repeatedly demystified \nas regressive and reactionary\u2014a return to ground zero and the reversion of \nhistory to mythic nature: the chronic cycle of generation and corruption, \nthe repetitive orbit of the stars and the planets, the perpetual circulation \nof days, years, and seasons, the Sisyphean return of the same. To assume \nauthorship of the laws is to defy the transcendence of Law\u2014to close the \nmetaphysical hiatus on which the law\u2019s very authority rests\u2014and therefore \nto succumb to the tyranny of stagnant nature. Thus the regression of the \nwilling subject to the wasteland of status naturalis, and the reduction of \nhuman freedom to the empty \u201cfreedom of a turnspit.\u201d\nHistory in this way collapses into nature, and nature in turn into \nfarce. The modernist figure of revolution as unpredictable historical frac-\nture slides into the traditional astronomical figure of revolution as irresist-\nible cyclical recurrence, while this latter figure of circularity in turn shifts \nfrom a consoling image of stability into a mocking image of meaningless-\nness and futility: one more spin of the wheel, a vain overturning awaiting \nits own overturning. By the late eighteenth century, the word \u201crevolution\u201d \n(re-volutio) pointed to both rupture and repetition, and the semantic strain \nwas beginning to be felt.24 The idea of revolution started to oscillate\u2014it \nrevolved\u2014between these two irreconcilable extremes. \u201cProgressive, con-\nstantly expanding evolution is the very stuff of history,\u201d Novalis declared;25 \nbut it was necessary to prevent the revolutionary\u2019s burden\u2014the stone of \nSisyphus\u2014from rolling back down the mountain, to hold it at the summit \n"
