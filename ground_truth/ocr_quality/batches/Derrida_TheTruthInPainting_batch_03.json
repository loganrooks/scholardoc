Who supplies it? Who \nconstructs it? Where is it imported from? \nFrom the analytic of concepts in the Critique of Pure [spec\u00ad\nulative] Reason. A brief reminder: this analytic of concepts is one \nof the two parts of the transcendental analytic (transcendental \nanalytic and dialectic, a division reproduced in the third Critique: \nanalytic and dialectic of aesthetic judgment). The transcendental \nanalytic comprises an analytic of concepts and an analytic of \nprinciples. The former breaks down the power of understanding \nin order to recognize in it the possibility of a priori concepts in \ntheir \"country of birth,\" namely the understanding, where they \nlie dormant and in reserve. Since (receptive) intuition alone relates \nimmediately to the object, the understanding does so by the in\u00ad\ntermediary, precisely, of judgments. Judgment is the mediate \nknowledge of an object. And we can \"refer all the acts of the \nunderstanding back to judgments, in such a way that the under\u00ad\nstanding in general can be represented as a power to judge ( Ur\u00ad\nteilskraft).\" The power to think as power to judge. One will thus \nfind the functions of the understanding by determining the func\u00ad\ntions of unity in judgment. Concepts relate, as predicates of pos\u00ad\nsible judgments, to the representation of an object. Consequently, \nby considering the simple form of the understanding, by abstract\u00ad\ning the content of judgments, one can establish the list of the \nforms of judgment under four headings and twelve moments ( four \ntimes three: the four-times-three also constructs the table (Tafel) \nI I. We have preferred to translate Derrida's \"finalite sans fin\" lit\u00ad\nerally as \"finality without end,\" rather than revert to the standard \"pur\u00ad\nposiveness without purpose\": this allows us to preserve a certain sense \nof Derrida's exploitation of different senses of the word fin (\"end\"), and \nto avoid certain traditional assumptions about Kant which Derrida's es\u00ad\nsay suspends at the very least. \"Purpose\" would be more suitable for but, \nbut we have tended to translate this as \"goal\" to avoid confusion. \n"

This is a \nlegitimate operation since it is a question of judgments. But it is \na transportation which is not without its problems and artful \nviolence: a logical frame is transposed and forced in to be imposed \non a nonlogical structure, a structure which no longer essentially \nconcerns a relation to the object as object of knowledge. The \naesthetic judgment, as Kant insists, is not a knowledge-judgment. \nThe frame fits badly. The difficulty can be felt from the first \nparagraph of the book, from the \"first moment of the judgment \nof taste considered from the point of view of quality.\" \"The judg\u00ad\nment of taste is aesthetic\": in this single case, not foreseen by \nthe analytic of concepts and judgments in the other Critique, the \njudgment is not a \"knowledge-judgment.\" Hence it does not come \nunder the transcendental logic whose board has been brought in. \nThe violence of the framing multiplies. It begins by enclosing \nthe theory of the aesthetic in a theory of the beautiful, the latter \nin a theory of taste and the theory of taste in a theory of judgment. \nThese are decisions which could be called external: the delimi\u00ad\ntation has enormous consequences, but a certain internal coher\u00ad\nence can be saved at this cost. The same does not apply for another \ngesture of framing which, by introducing the bord, does violence \nto the inside of the system and twists its proper articulations out \nof shape. This must therefore be the gesture of primary interest \nto us if we are seeking a rigorously effective grip. \n12. In English in the text. \n"

We do not see its end. Such a point of view, suddenly \n[de but en blanc], bends the totality to be lacking to itself. But \nthis lack does not deprive it of a part of itself. This lack does not \ndeprive it of anything. It is not a lack. The beautiful object, the \ntulip, is a whole, and it is the feeling of its harmonious com\u00ad\npleteness which delivers up its beauty to us. The without of the \npure cut is without lack, without lack of anything. And yet in \nmy experience of the accomplished tulip, of the plenitude of its \nsystem, my knowledge is lacking in something and this is nec\u00ad\nessary for me to find this totality beautiful. This something is \nnot some thing, it is not a thing, still less part of the thing, a \nfragment of the tulip, a bit [bout] of the system. And yet it is the \nend of the system.

The necessity \"thought\" in an aesthetic \njudgment can only be called \"exemplary\" (exemplarisch). It is the \nnecessity of the adhesion of all to a judgment as example (Beispiel) \nof a universal rule that one cannot enunciate (angeben) (\u00a7\u00a7 3 7  \nand 3 8, in the course of passing from the third to the fourth \ncategory, from the moment of relation to that of modality). Such \nwould be the effect of openmouthedness provoked by a unique \nexemplar whose beauty must be recognized in a judgment (mouth \nopen), without conceptual discourse, without enunciation of rules \n(mouth mute, breath cut, parole souffl.ee).27 \nTwo orders of examples: natural free beauties, analogous to \nthat of the flower (wild animals, birds, the parrot, the humming\u00ad\nbird, the bird of paradise), but also artificial free beauties, alien \nto nature. Great difficulties are foreseen. How could productions \nof art appear to us as finalities without end? As nonsignifying? \nCut from their goal? \nAnd yet it must be that there are such things if free, vague, \nwandering, pure beauty touches us in art also. But what are these \nexamples? What are the examples of productions of art which are \nbeautiful without signifying anything by and for themselves (be\u00ad\ndeuten [ . . .  ] fur sich nichts) and without representing anything? \nWithout theme and even without text, if text retains its old mean\u00ad\ning of \"signifying organization, organization of signification\"? \nShould we be surprised to encounter among them the frame or \nat least certain framing inscriptions? \n\"Plowers are free beauties of nature.

In the rhetoric of the paragraph, this sec\u00ad\nond type of example seems also to function as the insistent \nand metaphorical illustration of the first. The recourse to the \nexample of art is made in order to make us better understand \nthat of nature on a ground of analogy: \"So designs a la grecque \n[straight-line designs in labyrinth form], foliage for framework \n(Laubwerk zu Einfassungen) or on wall-papers, &c., have no \nintrinsic meaning; they represent nothing (sie stellen nichts \nvorl-no Object under a definite concept-and are free beauties. \nWe may also rank in the same class what in music are called \nfantasias [improvisation, free variation] (without a theme) (ohne \nThema), and, indeed, all music that is not set to words (die \nganze Musik ohne Text)\" (Meredith, 72). \nHence, what is beautiful according to art and with a free \nor wandering beauty, thus giving rise to a judgment of pure \ntaste, according to Kant, would be any finalized organization \nnot signifying anything, not representing anything, deprived of \ntheme and text (in the classical sense).

The foliation on frames, for example, can represent leaves, \nbut it deploys its beauty only without that representation. Its \nnon significance, its a-significance, rather, must have the form \nof finality, but without end. \nOne might be tempted, in exploiting this example (and \nnothing prohibits this by right), to conclude that contrary to \nwhat we were justified in thinking elsewhere, according to Kant \nthe parergon constitutes the place and the structure of free \nbeauty.

The \nframe, the framing, plays of forms and lines which are struc\u00ad\nturally homogeneous with the frame-structure. So it would be \ndifficult, if not impossible, to reconcile what Kant said about \nthe parergon two pages earlier and what he says here of the \nframing-foliation or the series of productions without theme \nand without text which are analogous to it. The difficulty al\u00ad\nlows us to sharpen up a cutting edge. \nLike the framing-foliation, the framing parergon is a-signi\u00ad\nfying and a-representative. Another common trait is that the \nframing can also, as parergon (an addition external to the rep\u00ad\nresentation), participate in and add to the satisfaction of pure \ntaste, provided that it does so by its form and not by sensory \nattraction (color) which would transform it into finery. So there \ncan be a certain beauty of the parergon, even if it is, precisely, \nsupplementary beauty. Now what separates the parergon from \nthe framing-foliation and from other products of the same type? \nThe foliation is here considered in itself, as object and not as \naccessory. If it does without signification and representation, \nthis is no longer at all like the frame. The frame does not \nsignify anything, and that's that, Kant seems to think. One sees \nin it no presentiment of any signification, nothing in it is fin\u00ad\nalized or finalizable. Whereas here the movement of significa\u00ad\ntion and representation is broached: the foliation, pure musical \nimprovisation, music without theme or without text seem to \nmean or to show something, they have the form of tending \ntoward some end. But this tension, this vection, this rection is \nabsolutely interrupted, with a clean blow. It has to be thus \ninterrupted: by having to be, purely, absolutely, removing all \nadherence to what it cuts itself off from, it liberates beauty \n( free, wandering, and vague).

Kant insists \non breaking with that tradition. In no case does the judgment of \ntaste bear on the perfection of the object, on its internal possibility \nof existence. To judge this latter, I must have at my disposal the \nconcept of what, quantitatively and qualitatively, the object must \nbe.

In the absence \nof a general concept of rules, and given that universality remains \na prerequisite, the value of the exemplary, of exemplary product \nof taste, becomes the sole or major reference.

Not being concep\u00ad\ntual, the exemplary cannot be imitated. One does not acquire \ntaste by imitation. The judgment of taste, even if it refers to \nprototypical (exemplary) productions, must be autonomous and \nspontaneous. Hence the supreme model, the highest pattern (das \nhochste Muster), can be only an idea, a mere idea which everyone \nmust produce (hervorbringen) in himself and according to which \nhe must judge everything that is an object of taste. There must \nbe a pattern but without imitation. Such is the logic of the ex\u00ad\nemplary, of the autoproduction of the exemplary, this metaphys\u00ad\nical value of production having always the double effect of opening \nand closing historicity.

The \nidea is a concept of reason, the ideal is the representation of a \nbeing or of a particular essence adequate to that idea. If we follow \nhere this value of adequation, we find the dwelling place of mi\u00ad\nmesis in the very place from which imitation seems excluded. \nAnd at the same time, of truth as adequation in this theory of \nthe beautiful. \nThe paradigm of the beautiful rests, then, on the idea of rea\u00ad\nson, on the absolutely indeterminate rational idea of a \"maxi\u00ad\nmum\"-Kant's word-of accord between judgments. This max\u00ad\nimum cannot be represented by concepts but only in a singular \npresentation (in einzelner Darstellung vorgestellt). The paradigm \nis not an idea but a singularity which we produce in ourselves in \nconformity with that idea: Kant proposes to call it ideal.

The free play in the \npresentation submits of itself to its regulation, to the regulatory \nidea of a maximal consensus among men. \nOnly man would be capable of presentation, since only he is \ncapable of production-of exemplarity, of ideal, etc. \nHere Kant poses a question and introduces a cleavage of great \nconsequence.
