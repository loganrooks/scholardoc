'An' signifies \"I am accustomed\", \"I am familiar with\", \"I look \nafter something\". 2 It has the signification of\"colo\" in the senses of \"habito\" \nand \"diligo\". The entity to which Being-in in this signification belongs is \none which we have characterized as that entity which in each case I \nmyself am (bin]. The expression 'bin' is connected with 'bei', and so 'ich \nbin' ['I am'] means in its turn \"I reside\" or \"dwell alongside\" the \nworld, as that which is familiar to me in such and such a way. 3 \n\"Being\" [Sein], as the infinitive of 'ich bin' (that is to say, when it is \nunderstood as an existentiale), signifies \"to reside alongside . . .  \", \"to be \nfamiliar with . .\n. \". \"Being-in\" is thus the formal existential expressionfor the \nBeing of Dasein, which has Being-in-the-world as its essential state. \n'Being alongside' the world in the sense of being absorbed in the world' \n1 Reading 'innan-wohnen'. As Heidegger points out in his footnote, this puzzling \npassage has its source in Grimm's Kleinere Schrijten, Vol. VII, pp. 247 ff., where we find \ntwo short articles, the first entitled 'IN' and the second 'IN UND BEl'. The first \narticle begins by comparing a number of archaic German words meaning 'domus', all \nhaving a form similar to our English 'inn', which Grimm mentions. He goes on \u00b7to \npostulate 'a strong verb \"innan\", which must have meant either \"habitare\", \"domi esse\", \nor \"recipere in domum\" 1 {though only a weak derivative form 'innian' is actually found), \nwith a surviving strong preterite written either as 'an' or as 'ann'. Grimm goes on \nto argue that the preposition 'in' is derived from the verb, rather than the verb from the \npreposition. \n2 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  \"an\" bedeutet: ich bin gewohnt, vertraut mit, ich pflege etwas \u2022 .  .' \nIn Grimm's second article he adds: 'there was also an anomalous \"ann\" with the plural \n\"unum\", which expressed \"amo\", \"diligo\", ''faveo\", and to which our \"gonnen\" and \n\"Gunst\" are immediately related, as has long been recognized. \"Ann\" really means \"ich \nbin eingewohnt\", \"pflege zu bauen\"; this conceptual transition may be shown with \nminimal complication in the Latin \"colo\", which stands for \"habito\" as well as \"diligo\".' \nIt is not entirely clear whether Heidegger's discussion of 'an' is aimed to elucidate the \npreposition 'an' ( which corresponds in some of its usages to the English 'at', and which he \nhas just used in remarking that the water and the glass are both at a location), or rather \nto explain the preterite 'an' of 'innan'. \nThe reader should note that while the verb 'wohnen' normally means 'to reside' or 'to \ndwell', the expression 'ich bin gewohnt' means 'I am accustomed to', and 'ich bin einge\u00ad\nwohnt' means 'I have become accustomed to the place where I reside--to my surround\u00ad\nings'. Similarly 'ich pf!ege etwas' may mean either 'I am accustomed to do something' \nor 'I take care of something' or 'I devote myself to it'. ( Grimm's 'pf!ege zu bauen' pre\u00ad\nsumably means 'I am accustomed to putting my trust in something', 'I can build on it'.) \nThe Latin, 'colo' has the parallel meanings of 'I take care of something' or 'cherish' it \n('diligo') and 'I dwell' or 'I inhabit' ('habito'). \na '  \n\u2022\n.\n\u2022\n ich wohne, halte mich auf bei . . .  der Welt, als dem so und so Vertrauten.' The \npreposition 'bei', like 'an', does not have quite the semantical range of any English pre\u00ad\nposition. Our 'alongside', with which we shall translate it when other devices seem less \nsatisfactory, especially in the phrase 'Being alongside' ('Sein bei'), is often quite mis\u00ad\nleading; the sense here is closer to that of 'at' in such expressions as 'at home' or 'at my \nfather's', or that of the French 'che;r.'. Here again Heidegger seems to be relying upon \nGrimm, who proceeds (loc. cit.) to connect 'bei' with 'bauen' ('build') and 'bin'. \n\u009b '  \n.\n.\n\u2022\n in dem .\n. \u2022 Sinne des Aufgehens in der Welt . .  .' 'Aufgehen' means literally 'to go \nup', or 'to rise' in the sense that the sun 'rises' or the dough 'rises'. But when followed by \nthe preposition 'in', it takes on other meanings.

      "full_text": "1. 2 \nBeing and Time \n81 \n(a sense which calls for still closer interpretation) is an existentiale founded \nupon Being-in. In these analyses the issue is one of seeing a primordial \nstructure of Dasein's Being-a structure in accordance with whose phe\u00ad\nnomenal content the concepts of Being must be Articulated ; because of \nthis, and because this structure is in principle one which cannot be \ngrasped by the traditional ontological categories, this 'being-alongside' \n55 \nmust be examined still more closely. We shall again choose the method of \ncontrasting it with a relationship of Being which is essentially different \nontologically-viz. categorial-but which we express by the same linguis-\ntic means. Fundamental ontological distinctions are easily obliterated; \nand if they are to be envisaged phenomenally in this way, this must be \ndone explicitly, even at the risk of discussing the 'obvious'. The status of \nthe ontological analytic shows, however, that we have been far from \ninterpreting these obvious matters with an adequate 'grasp', still less with \nregard for the meaning of their Being; and we are even farther from \npossessing a stable coinage for the appropriate structural concepts. \nAs an existentiale, 'Being alongside' the world never means anything \nlike the Being-present-at-hand-together of Things that occur. There is no \nsuch thing as the 'side-by-side-ness' of an entity called 'Dasein' with \nanother entity called 'world'. Of course when two things are present-at\u00ad\nhand together alongside one another, 1 we are accustomed to express this \noccasionally by something like 'The table stands \"by\" ['bei'] the door' \nor 'The chair \"touches\" ['beriihrt'] the wall'. Taken strictly, 'touching' is \nnever what we are talking about in such cases, not because accurate re\u00ad\nexamination will always eventually establish that there is a space between \nthe chair and the wall, but because in principle the chair can never touch \nthe wall, even if the space between them should be equal to zero. If the \nchair could touch the wall, this would presuppose that the wall is the sort \nof thing 'for' which a chair would be encounter able. 2 An entity present-at\u00ad\nhand within the world can be touched by another entity only if by its \nvery nature the latter entity has Being-in as its own kind of Being--only if, \nwith its Being-there [Da-sein], something like the world is already re-, \nvealed to it, so that from out of that world another entity can manifest \nitself in touching, and thus become accessible in its Being-present-at\u00ad\nhand. When two entities are present-at-hand within the world, and fur\u00ad\nthermore are worldless in themselves, they can never 'touch' each other, \nit 'goes into' 30 without remainder; a country 'geht auf' into another country into which \nit is taken over or absorbed; a person 'geht auf' in anything to which he devotes \nhimself fully, whether an activity or another person. We shall usually translate 'aufgehen' \nby some form of 'absorb'. \n1 'Das Beisammen zweier Vorhandener . .  .' \na 'Voraussetzung dafiir ware, dass die Wand \"fur\" den Stuhl begegnen konnte.'

The clause 'furthermore \nare worldless' must not be left out; for even entities which are not world\u00ad\nless-Dasein itself, for example-are present-at-hand 'in' the world, or, \nmore exactly, can with some right and within certain limits be taken as \nmerely present-at-hand. To do this, one must completely disregard or just \nnot see the existential state of Being-in. But the fact that 'Dasein' can be \ntaken as something which is present-at-hand and just present-at-hand, is \nnot to be confused with acertainwayof'presence-at-hand' which is Dasein's \nown. This latter kind of presence-at-hand becomes accessible not by dis\u00ad\nregarding Dasein's specific structures but only by understanding them in \nc.dvance. Dasein understands its ownmost Being in the sense of a certain \n56 \n'factual Being-present-at-hand'.ii And yet the 'factuality' of the fact \n[Tatsache] of one's own Dasein is at bottom quite different ontologically \nfrom the factual occurrence of some kind of mineral, for example. When\u00ad\never Dasein is, it is as a Fact; and the factuality of such a Fact is what we \n\u0262hall call Dasein's ''facticity\" .1 This is a definite way of Being [Seinsbe\u00ad\nstimmtheit], and it has a complicated structure which cannot even be \ngrasped as a problem until Dasein's basic existential states have been \nworked out. The concept of \"facticity\" implies that an entity 'within-the\u00ad\nworld' has Being-in-the-world in such a way that it can understand itself \nas bound up in its 'destiny' with the Being of those entities which it \nencounters within its own world. \nIn the first instance it is enough to see the ontological difference \nbetween Being-in as an existentiale and the category of the 'insideness' \nwhich things present-at-hand can have with regard to one another. By \nthus delimiting Being-in, we are not denying every kind of 'spatiality' \nto Dasein. On the contrary, Dasein itself has a 'Being-in-space' of its \nO\\\\ n; but this in turn is possible only on the basis of Being-in-the-world in \ngeneral. Hence Being-in is not to be explained ontologically by some \non tical characterization, as if one were to say, for instance, that Being-in \nin a world is a spiritual property, and that man's 'spatiality' is a result of \nhis bodily nature (which, at the same time, always gets 'founded' upon \ncorporeality) . Here again we are faced with the Being-present-at-hand\u00ad\ntogether of some such spiritual Thing along with a corporeal Thing, \nwhile the Being of the entity thus compounded remains more obscure \n1 'Die Tatsachlichkeit des Faktums Dasein, als welches jeweilig jedes Dasein ist, \nnennen wir seine Fakti::itiit.' We shall as a rule translate 'Tatsachlichkeit' as 'factuality', \nand 'Faktizitat' as 'facticity', following our conventions for 'tatsachlich' and 'faktisch'. \n(See note 2, p. 27, H. 7 above.) The present passage suggests a comparable distinction \nbetween the nouns 'Tatsache' and 'Faktum' ;  so while we find many passages where these \nseem to be used in terchangeably, we translate 'Faktum' as 'Fact' with an initial capital, \nusing 'fact' for 'Tatsache' and various other expressions.

Such an insight will keep us from failing to see this structure or \nfrom previously cancelling it out-a procedure motivated not ontologi\u00ad\ncally but rather 'metaphysically' by the naive supposition that man is, \nin the first instance, a spiritual Thing which subsequently gets misplaced \n'into' a space. \nDasein's facticity is such that its Being-in-the-world has always dis\u00ad\npersed [ zerstreutJ itself or even split itself up into definite ways of Being-\nin. The multiplicity of these is indicated by the following examples : having \nto do with something, producing something, attending to something and \nlooking after it, making use of something, giving something up and letting \nit go, undertaking, accomplishing, evincing, interrogating, considering, \ndiscussing, determining . . . .  All these ways of Being-in have concern1 as \n57 \ntheir kind of Being-a kind of Being which we have yet to characterize in \ndetail. Leaving undone, neglecting, renouncing, taking a rest-these too \nare ways of concern; but these are all deficient modes, in which the pos\u00ad\nsibilities of concern are kept to a 'bare minimum'. 2 The term 'concern' \nhas, in the first instance, its colloquial [ vorwissenschaftliche] signification, \nand can mean to carry out something, to get it done [erledigen], to \n'straighten it out'. It can also mean to 'provide oneself with something'. 3 \nWe use the expression with still another characteristic tum of phrase \nwhen we say \"I am concerned for the success of the undertaking.\"' Here \n'concern' means something like apprehensiveness. In contrast to these \ncolloquial ontical significations, the expression 'concern' will be used in \nthis investigation as an ontological term for an existentiale, and will desig-\nnate the Being of a possible way of Being-in-the-world. This term has \nbeen chosen not because Dasein happens to be proximally and to a large \nextent 'practical' and economic, but because the Being of Dasein itself \n1 'Besorgen'. AJ Heideger points out, he will use this term in a special sense which is to \nbe distinguished from many of its customary usages. We shall, as a rule, translate it by \n'concern' though this is by no means an exact equivalent. The English word 'concern' is \nused in \u0331any expresions where 'Besorgen' would be inappropriate in German, such as \n'This concerns you' 'That is my concern', 'He has an interest in several banking con\u00ad\ncerns'. 'Besorgen' s\u0330ds rather for the kind of 'concern' in which we 'concern ourselves' \nwith activities which we perform or things which we procure. \nz \u2022 . . . a:Je Modi des \"Nur noch\" in bezug auf Moglichkeiten des Besorgens.' The point \nis that in these cases concern is just barely ('nur noch') involved. \n3 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n sich etwas besorgen im Sinne von \"sich etwas verschaffen\".' \n4 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n ich besorge, dass das Unternehmen !llisslingt.' Here it is not diffic\u0104l\u0105 to find a \ncorresponding usage of 'concern', as our versiOn suggests. But the ana\u032fo!p' IS \n,\nImperfect. \nWhile we can say that we are 'concerned for the success of the enterpriSe or concerned \nlest the enterprise should fail,' we w\u0106uld hardly f?llow the German to the extent of \nexpresing 'concern that' the enterpriSe should fat!; nor would the German express \n'Beaorgen' at discovering that the enterprise has failed already. \n"

It has \nnothing to do with 'tribulation', 'melancholy', or the 'cares oflife', though \nontically one can come across these in every Dasein. These-like their \nopposites, 'gaiety' and 'freedom from care'-are ontically possible only \nbecause Dasein, when understood ontologically, is care. Because Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world belongs essentially to Dasein, its Being towards the world [Sein \nzur Welt] is essentially concern. \nFrom what we have been saying, it follows that Being-in is not a 'pro\u00ad\nperty' which Dasein sometimes has and sometimes does not have, and \nwithout which it could be just as well as it could with it. It is not the case \nthat man 'is' and then has, by way of an extra, a relationship-of-Being \ntowards the 'world'-a world with which he provides himself occasionally. 2 \nDasein is never 'proximally' an entity which is, so to speak, free from \nBeing-in, but which sometimes has the inclination to take up a 'relation\u00ad\nship' towards the world. Taking up relationships towards the world is \npossible only because Dasein, as Being-in-the-world, is as it is. This state of \nBeing does not arise just because some other entity is present-at-hand \noutside ofDasein and meets up with it. Such an entity can 'meet up with' \nDasein only in so far as it can, of its own accord, show itself within a world. \nNowadays there is much talk about 'man's having an environment \n[Umwelt] '; but this says nothing ontologically as long as this 'having' is \nleft indefinite. In its very possibility this 'having' is founded upon the \n58 \nexistential state of Being-in. Because Dasein is essentially an entity with \nBeing-in, it can explicitly discover those entities which it encounters \nenvironmentally, it can know them, it can avail itself of them, it can have \nthe 'world'. To talk about 'having an environment' is ontically trivial, \nbut ontologically it presents a problem. To solve it requires nothing else \nthan defining the Being of Dasein, and doing so in a way which is onto\u00ad\nlogically adequate. Although this state of Being is one of which use has \nmade in biology, especially since K. von Baer, one must not conclude \nthat its philosophical use implies 'biologism'. For the environment is a \nstructure which even biology as a positive science can never find and can \nnever define, but must presuppose and constantly \n.\nemploy. Yet, even as an \na priori condition for the objects which biology takes for its theme, this \nstructure itself can be explained philosophically only if it has been con\u00ad\nceived beforehand as a structure ofDasein. Only in terms of an orientation \n1 'Sorge'. The important etymological connection between 'Besorgen' ('concern') and \n'Sorge' ('care') is lost in our translation.

This state of Dasein's Being is now \none with which one is just barely acquainted (and indeed as something \nobvious), with the stamp of an inappropriate interpretation. So in this \nway it becomes the 'evident' point of departure for problems of epistemo\u00ad\nlogy or the 'metaphysics of knowledge'. For what is more obvious than \nthat a 'subject' is related to an 'Object' and vice versa ? This 'subject\u00ad\nObject-relationship' must be presupposed. But while this presupposition \nis unimpeachable in its facticity, this makes it indeed a baleful one, if its \nontological necessity and especially its ontological meaning are to be left \nin the dark. \nThus the phenomenon of Being-in has for the most part been repre\u00ad\nsented exclusively by a single exemplar-knowing the world. This has not \nonly been the case in epistemology; for even practical behaviour has been \nunderstood as behaviour which is 'non-theoretical' and 'a theoretical'. \nBecause knowing has been given this priority, our understanding of its own\u00ad\nmost kind of Being gets led astray, and accordingly Being-in-the-world \nmust be exhibited even more precisely with regard to knowing the world, \nand must itself be made visible as an existential 'modality' of Being-in. \n\u01b3 13. A Founded Mode in which Being-in is Exemplijied.1 Knowing the World. \nIf Being-in-the-world is a basic state ofDasein, and one in which Dasein \noperates not only in general but pre-eminently in the mode of everyday\u00ad\nness, then it must also be something which has always been experienced \nontically. It would be unintelligible for Being-in-the-world to remain \n6o \ntotally veiled from view, especially since Dasein has at its disposal an \nunderstanding of its own Being, no matter how indefinitely this under\u00ad\nstanding may function. But no sooner was the 'phenomenon of \nknowing the world' grasped than it got interpreted in a 'superficial', \n1 'Die Exemplijizierung des ln-Seins an einemfundierten Modus.' The conception of 'founded' \nmodes is taken from Husser!, who introduces the concept of 'founding' in his Logische \nUntersuchungen, vol. II, Part I, chapter 2 (second edition, Halle, 19 13, p. 261). This \npasage has been closely paraphrased as follows by Marvin Farber in his The Fourukztion \nof Phenomenology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1943, p. 297 ; 'If in accordance with esential \nlaw an a can only exist in a comprehensive unity which connects it with a ,., then we \nsay, an a as such needs foundation through a ,., or also, an a as such is in need of com\u00ad\npletion by means of a f'\u00b7 If accordingly ao , f'O are definite particular cases of the pure \ngenera a, or ,., which stand in the cited relationship, and if they are members of one \nwhole, then we say that ao is founded by f'O; and it is exclusively founded by f'O if the need \nof the completion of ao is alone satisfied by f'O\u2022 This terminology can be applied to the \nspecies themselves ; the equivocation is harmles.' Thus a founded mode of Being-in is \nsimply a mode which can subsist only when connected with something else. \n"

The evidence for this is the procedure (still customary \ntoday) of setting up knowing as a 'relation between subject and Object' \n-a procedure in which there lurks as much 'truth' as vacuity. But subject \nand Object do not coincide with Dasein and the world. \nEven if it were feasible to give an ontological definition of \"Being-in\" \nprimarily in terms of a Being-in-the-world which knows, it would still be our \nfirst task to show that knowing has the phenomenal character of a Being \nwhich is in and towards the world. If one reflects upon this relationship of \nBeing, an entity called \"Nature\" is given proximally as that which becomes \nknown. Knowing, as such, is not to be met in this entity. If knowing 'is' at \nall, it belongs solely to those entities which know. But even in those entities, \nhuman-Things, knowing is not present-at-hand. In any case, it is not \nexternally ascertainable as, let us say, bodily properties are.1 Now, inas\u00ad\nmuch as knowing belongs to these entities and is not some external \ncharacteristic, it must be 'inside'. Now the more unequivocally one main\u00ad\ntains that knowing is proximally and really 'inside' and indeed has by no \nmeans the same kind of Being as entities which are both physical and \npsychical, the less one presupposes when one believes that one is making \nheadway in the question of the essence of knowledge and in the clarifica\u00ad\ntion of the relationship between subject and Object. For only then can \nthe problem arise of how this knowing subject comes out of its inner \n'sphere' into one which is 'other and external', of how knowing can have \nany object at all, and of how one must think of the object itself so that \neventually the subject knows it without needing to venture a leap into \nanother sphere. But in any of the numerous varieties which this approach \nmay take, the question of the kind of Being which belongs to this knowing \nsubject is left entirely unasked, though whenever its knowing gets handled, \nits way of Being is already included tacitly in one's theme. Of course we \nare sometimes assured that we are certainly not to think of the subject's \n\"inside\" [Innen] and its 'inner sphere' as a sort of 'box' Gr 'cabinet'. But \nwhen one asks for the positive signification of this 'inside' of immanence \nin which knowing is proximally enclosed, or when one inquires how this \n'Being inside' [\"Innenseins\"] which knowing possesses has its own char\u00ad\nacter of Being grounded in the kind of Being which belongs to the subject, \nthen silence reigns. And no matter how this inner sphere may get inter\u00ad\npreted, if one does no more than ask how knowing makes its way 'out of' \nit and achieves 'transcendence', it becomes evident that the knowing \n6r \nwhich presents such enigmas will remain problematical unless one has \npreviously clarified how it is and what it is. \n1 'In jedem Faile ist est nicht so ausserlich feststellbar wie etwa leibliche Eigenschaften. \nThe older editions have ' . \u2022 .  nicht ist es . .  .' and place a comma after 'feststellbar'. \n"

But if, as we suggest, we thus find phenomenally that \nknowing is a kind of Being which belongs to Being-in-the-world, one might object \nthat with such an Interpretation of knowing, the problem of knowledge \nis nullified; for what is left to be asked if one presupposes that knowing is \nalready 'alongside' its world, when it is not supposed to reach that world \nexcept in the transcending of the subject? In this question the construc\u00ad\ntivist 'standpoint', which has not been phenomenally demonstrated, again \ncomes to the fore; but quite apart from this, what higher court is to decide \nwhether and in what sense there is to be any problem of knowledge other \nthan that of the phenomenon of knowing as such and the kind of Being \nwhich belongs to the knower? \nIf we now ask what shows itself in the phenomenal findings about \nknowing, we must keep in mind that knowing is grounded beforehand \nin a Being-already-alongside-the-world, which is essentially constitutive \nfor Dasein's Being.1 Proximally, this Being-already-alongside is not just \na fixed staring at something that is purely present-at-hand. Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, as concern, is fascinated by the world with which it is concerned. 2 \nIf knowing is to be possible as a way of determining the nature of the \npresent-at-hand by observing it, 3 then there must first be a deficiency in our \nhaving-to-do with the world concernfully. When concern holds back \n[Sichenthalten] from any kind of producing, manipulating, and the like, \nit puts itself into what is now the sole remaining mode of Being-in, the \nmode of just tarrying alongside . . . .

This perceptive retention of an assertion6 about \nsomething is itself a way of Being-in-the-world; it is not to be Interpreted \nas a 'procedure' by which a subject provides itself with representations \n[V orstellungen] of something which remain stored up 'inside' as having \nbeen thus appropriated, and with regard to which the question of how \nthey 'agree' with actuality can occasionally arise. \nWhen Dasein directs itself towards something and grasps it, it does not \nsomehow first get out of an inner sphere in which it has been proximally \nencapsulated, but its primary kind of Being is such that it is always \n'outside' alongside entities which it encounters and which belong to a \nworld already discovered. Nor is any inner sphere abandoned when \nDasein dwells alongside the entity to be known, and determines its char\u00ad\nacter ; but even in this 'Being-outside' alongside the object, Dasein is still \n'inside', if we understand this in the correct sense; that is to say, it is itself \n'inside' as a Being-in-the-world which knows. And furthermore, the \nperceiving of what is known is not a process of returning with one's booty \nto the 'cabinet' of consciousness after one has gone out and grasped it; \neven in perceiving, retaining, and preserving, the Dasein which knows \nremains outside, and it does so as Dasein.

The word 'Aufenthalt' norm\u00ad\nally means a stopping-off at some place, a sojourn, an abiding, or even an abode or dwel\u00ad\nling. Here the author is exploiting the fact that it includes both the prefixes 'auf-' and \n'ent-', which we find in the verbs 'aufhalten' and 'enthalten'. 'Aufhalten' means to hold \nsomething at a stage which it has reached, to arrest it, to stop it; when used reflexively it \ncan mean to stay at a place, to dwell there. While 'enthalten' usually means to contain, \nit preserves its more literal meaning of holding back or refraining, when it is used re\u00ad\nflexively. All these meanings are presumably packed into the word 'Aufenthalt' as used \nhere, and are hardly suggested by our 'd\u00fdelling'. \n3 'Das Vernehmen hat die Vollzugsart des Ansprechens und Besprechens von etwas als \netwas.'

By unravelling these we can get \nan indication of the different kinds of phenomena that are signified, and \nof the way in which they are interconnected. \n1 .  \"World\" is used as an ontical concept, and signifies the totality of \nthose entities which can be present-at-hand within the world. \n2. \"World\" functions as an ontological term, and signifies the Being \nof those entities which we have just mentioned. And indeed 'world' can \nbecome a term for any realm which encompasses a multiplicity of entities : \nfor instance, when one talks of the 'world' of a mathematician, 'world' \n65 \nsignifies the realm of possible objects of mathematics. \n3\u00b7 \"World\" can be understood in another ontical sense-not, however, \nas those entities which Dasein essentially is not and which can be en\u00ad\ncountered within-the-world, but rather as that 'wherein' a factical Dasein \nas such can be said to 'live' . \"World\" has here a pre-ontological existentiell \nsignification. Here again there are different possibilities : ''world\" rna y stand \nfor the 'public' we-world, or one's 'own' closest (domestic) environment.1 \n4\u00b7 Finally, \"world\" designates the ontologico-existential concept of \nworldhood. Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural \nwholes any special 'worlds' may have at the time ; but it embraces in itself \nthe a priori character of worldhood in general. We shall reserve the \nexpression \"world\" as a term for our third signification. If we should \nsometimes use it in the first of these senses, we shall mark this with \nsingle quotation marks. \nThe derivative form 'worldly' will then apply terminologically to a \nkind of Being which belongs to Dasein, never to a kind which belongs to \nentities present-at-hand 'in' the world. We shall designate these latter \nentities as \"belonging to the world\" or \"within-the-world\" [weltzuge\u00ad\nhorig oder innerweltlich] . \nA glance at previous ontology shows that if one fails to see Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world as a state of Dasein, the phenomenon of worldhood likewise \ngets passed over. One tries instead to Interpret the world in terms of the \nBeing of those entities which are present-at-hand within-the-world but \nwhich are by no means proximally discovered-namely, in terms of \nNature.

The word 'Umwelt', which is \ncustomarily translated as 'environment', means literally the 'world around' or the 'world \nabout'. The prefix 'urn-', however, not only may mean 'around' or 'about', but, as we \nshall see, can also be used in an expression such as 'urn zu . .  .', which is most easily \ntranslated as 'in order to'. Section 15 will be largely devoted to a study of several words in \nwhich this same prefix occurs, though this is by no means apparent in the words we have \nchosen to represent them: 'Umgang' ('dealings') ; 'das Um-zu' {'the \"in-order-to\" ') ; \n'Umsicht' ('circumspection'). \n"

Equipment-in accord\u00ad\nance with its equipmentality-always is in terms of [aus] its belonging to \nother equipment : ink-stand, pen, ink, paper, blotting pad, table, lamp, \nfurniture, windows, doors, room. These 'Things' never show themselves \n1 'das <;eug'. The word 'Zeug' has no precise English equivalent. While it may mean any \nimplement, instrument, or tool, Heidegger uses it for the most part as a collective noun \nwhich is analogous to our relatively specific 'gear' (as in 'gear for fishing') or the more \nelaborate 'paraphernalia', or the still more general 'equipment', which we shall employ \nthroughout this translation. In this collective sense 'Zeug' can sometimes be used in a way \nwhich is comparable to the use of 'stuff' in such sentences as 'there is plenty of stuff lying \naround'. (See H. 74.) In general, however, this pejorative connotation is lacking. For the \nmost part Heidegger uses the term as a collective noun, so that he can say that there is no \nsuch thing as 'an equipment' ; but he still uses it occasionally with an indefinite article to \nrefer to some specific tool or instrument-some item or bit of equipment. \n2 'In der Struktur \"Um-zu\" liegt eine Verweisung von etwas auf etwas.' There is no close \nEnglish equivalent for the word 'Verweisung', which occurs many times in this chapter. \nThe basic metaphor seems to be that of turning something away towards something else, \nor pointing it away, as when one 'refers' or 'commits' or 'relegates' or 'asigns' something \nto something else, whether one 'refers' a symbol to what it symbolizes, 'refers' a beggar \nto a welfare agency, 'commits' a person for trial, 'relegates' or 'banishes' him to Siberia, \nor even 'assigns' equipment to a purpose for which it is to be used. 'Verweisung' thus does \nsome of the work of 'reference', 'commitment', 'assignment', 'relegation', 'banishment'; \nbut it does not do all the work of any of these expressions. For a businessman to 'refer' to \na letter, for a symbol to 'refer' to what it symbolizes, for a man to 'commit larceny or \nmurder' or merely to 'commit himself' to certain partisan views, for a teacher to give a \npupil a long 'assignment', or even for a journalist to receive an 'assignment' to the Vatican, \nwe would have to find some other verb than 'verweisen'. We shall, however, use the \nverbs 'assign' and 'refer' and their derivatives as perhaps the least misleading substitutes, \nemploying whichever seems the more appropriate in the context, and occasionally using \na hendiadys as in the present passage. See Section 1 7  for further discussion. (When other \nwords such as 'anweisen' or 'zuweisen' are translated as 'assign', we shall usually subjoin \nthe German in brackets.) \n"

Out of this the 'arrangement' emerges, and it is \n69 \nin this that any 'individual' item of equipment shows itself. Before it does \nso, a totality of equipment has already been discovered. \nEquipment can genuinely show itself only in dealings cut to its own \nmeasure (hamering with a hammer, for example) ; but in such dealings \nan entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing, \nnor is the equipment-structure known as such even in the using. The \nhammering does not simply have knowledge about [urn] the hamer's \ncharacter as equipment, but it has appropriated this equipment in a way \nwhich could not possibly be more suitable. In dealings such as this, where \nsometQing is put to use, our concern subordinates itself to the \"in-order\u00ad\nto\" which is constitutive for the equipment we are employing at the time; \nthe less we just stare at the hammer-Thing, and the more we seize hold \nof it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, \nand the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is-as equip\u00b7 \nment. The hammering itself uncovers the specific 'manipulability' \n[\"Handlichkeit\"] of the hammer.

In ordinary German \nusage, 'Umsicht' seems to have much the same connotation as our 'circumspection'-a \nkind of awarenes in which one looks around before one decides just what one ought to \ndo next.

Theoretical behaviour is just looking, without circumspection. But \nthe fact that this looking is non-circumspective does not mean that it \nfollows no rules : it constructs a canon for itself in the form of method. \nThe ready-to-hand is not grasped theoretically at all, nor is it itself \nthe sort of thing that circumspection takes proximally as a circumspective \ntheme. The peculiarity of what is proximally ready-to-hand is that, in \nits readiness-to-hand, it must, as it were, withdraw [zuriickzuziehen] in \norder to be ready-to-hand quite authentically. That with which our every-\nday dealings proximally dwell is not the tools themselves [die Werkzeuge \nselbst]. On the contrary, that with which we concern ourselves primarily \nis the work-that which is to be produced at the time; and this is accord\u00ad\ningly ready-to-hand too. The work bears with it that referential totality \n70 \nwithin which the equipment is encountered. 2 \nThe work to be produced, as the \"towards-which\" of such things as the \nhammer, the plane, and the needle, likewise has the kind of Being that \nbelongs to equipment. The shoe which is to be produced is for wearing \n(footgear) [Schuhzeug] ; the clock is manufactured for telling the time. \nThe work which we chiefly encounter in our concernful dealings-the \nwork that is to be found when one is \"at work\" on something [ das in \nArbeit befindliche]-has a usability which belongs to it essentially; in \nthis usability it lets us encounter already the \"towards-which\" for which \nit is usable. A work that someone has ordered [das bestellte Werk] i s  only \nby reason of its use and the assignment-context of entities which is dis\u00ad\ncovered in using it. \nBut the work to be produced is not merely usable for something.

In \nthis chapter the word 'Werk' ('work') usually refers to the product achieved by working \nrather than to the process of working as such.

If, in our everyday concern with the 'environment', it is to be possible \nfor equipment ready-to-hand to be encountered in its 'Being-in-itself' \n[in seinem \"An-sich-sein\"], then \u00df those assignments and referential \ntotalities in which our circumspection 'is absorbed' cannot become a \ntheme for that circumspection any more than they can for grasping \nthings 'thematically' but non-circumspectively. If it is to be possible for \nthe ready-to-hand not to emerge from its inconspicuousness, the world \nmust not announce itself. And it is in this that the Being-in-itself of entities \nwhich are ready-to-hand has its phenomenal structure constituted. \nIn such privative expressions as \"inconspicuousness\", \"unobtrusive\u00ad\nness\", and \"non-obstinacy\", what we have in view is a positive pheno\u00ad\nmenal character of the Being of that which is proximally ready-to-hand. \nWith these negative prefixes we have in view the character \u00b7of the ready\u00ad\nto-hand as \"holding itself in\" ; this is what we have our eye upon in the \n\"Being-in-itself\" of something, 1 though 'proximally' we ascribe it to the \npresent-at-hand-to the present-at-hand as that which can be themati\u00ad\ncally ascertained.

If, however, this talk about the 'in-itself' has any \n76 \nontological importance, some interpretation must be called for. This \n\"in-itself\" of Being is something which gets invoked with considerable \nemphasis, mostly in an ontical way, and rightly so from a phenomenal \nstandpoint. But if some ontological assertion is supposed to be given when \nthis is ontically invoked, its claims are not fulfilled by such a procedure. As \nthe foregoing analysis has already made clear, only on the basis of the \nphenomenon of the world can the Being-in-itself of entities within-the\u00ad\nworld be grasped ontologically. \nBut if the world can, in a way, be lit up, it must assuredly be disclosed. \nAnd it has already been disclosed beforehand whenever what is ready-to\u00ad\nhand within-the-world is accessible for circumspective concern. The world \nis therefore something 'wherein' Dasein as an entity already was, and if in \ndetailed awareness of the contents which are thus 'disclosed', but rather that they have \nbeen 'laid open' to us as implicit in what is given, so that they may be made explicit to \nour awareness by further analysis or discrimination of the given, rather than by any \ninference from it. \n1 'Diese \"Un\" meinen den Charakter des Ansichhaltens des Zuhandenen, das, was wir \nmit dem An-sich-sein im Auge haben . . .

It is \nequipment for indicating, and as equipment, it is constituted by reference \nor assignment. It has the character of the \"in-order-to\", its own definite \nserviceability; it is for indicating.1 This indicating which the sign performs \ncan be taken as a kind of 'referring'.

But an entity may have serviceability \nwithout thereby becoming a sign. As equipment, a 'hammer' too is \nconstituted by a serviceability, but this does not make it a sign. Indicating, \nas a 'reference', is a way in which the \"towards-which\" of a service\u00ad\nability becomes ontically concrete ; it determines an item of equipment \nas fo r this \"towards-which\" [und bestimmt ein Zeug zu diesem]. On the \nother hand, the kind of reference we get in 'serviceability-for', is an \nontologico-categorial attribute of equipment as equipment. That the \n\"towards-which\" of serviceability should acquire its concreteness in \nindicating, is an accident of its equipment-constitution as such. In this \nexample of a sign, the difference between the reference of serviceability \nand the reference of indicating becomes vi\u00d8ble in a rough and ready \nfashion. These are so far from coinciding that only when they are united \ndoes the concreteness of a definite kind of equipment become possible. \n79 \nNow it is certain that indicating differs in principle from reference as a \nconstitutive state of equipment; it is just as incontestable that the sign in \nits turn is related in a peculiar and even distinctive way to the kind of \nBeing which belongs to whatever equipmental totality may be ready-to\u00ad\nhand in the environment, and to its worldly character. In our concernful \n1 'Es hat den Charakter des Um-zu, seine bestimmte Dienlichkeit, es ist zum Zeigen.' \nThe verb 'dienen', is often followed by an infinitive construction introduced by the \npreposition 'zu'. Similarly the English 'serve' can be followed by an infinitive in such \nexpressions as 'it serves to indicate . . .  \n' In Heidegger's German the 'zu' construction is \ncarried over to the noun 'Dienlichkeit'; the corresponding noun 'serviceability', however, \nis not normally followed by an infinitive, but rather by an expression introduced by 'for' \ne.g. 'serviceability for indicating . . .  ' Since the preposition 'zu' plays an important role in \nthis section and the next, it would be desirable to provide a uniform translation for it. We \nshall, however, translate it as 'for' in such expressions as 'Dienlichkeit zu', but as 'towards' \nin such expressions as 'Wozu' ('towards-which') and 'Dazu' ('towards-this'), retaining \n'in-order-to' for 'Um-zu'. \n"

A sign to mark \nsomething indicates what one is 'at' at any time. Signs always indicate \nprimarily 'wherein' one lives, where one's concern dwells, what sort of \ninvolvement there is with something. 2 \nThe peculiar character of signs as equipment becomes especially clear \nin 'establishing a sign' [\"Zeichenstiftung\"]. This activity is performed in \na circumspective fore-sight [Vorsicht] out of which it arises, and which \nrequires that it be possible for one's particular environment to announce \nitself for circumspection at any time by means of something ready-to\u00ad\nhand, and that this possibility should itself be ready-to-hand. But the \nBeing of what is most closely ready-to-hand within-the-world possesses \nthe character of holding-itself-in and not emerging, which we have \ndescribed above. 3 Accordingly our circumspective dealings in the environ\u00ad\nment require some equipment ready-to-hand which in its character as \nequipment takes over the 'work' of letting something ready-to-hand become \nconspicuous.

But even when signs are thus conspicuous, one \ndoes not let them be present-at-hand at random; they get 'set up' \n[\"angebracht\"] in a definite way with a view towards easy accessibility. \nIn establishing a sign, however, one does not necessarily have to pro\u00ad\nduce equipment which is not yet ready-fo-hand at all. Signs also arise \nwhen one takes as a sign [Zum-Zeichen-nehmen] something that is ready-to\u00ad\nhand already. In this mode, signs \"get established\" in a sense which is \neven more primordial. In indicating, a ready-to-hand equipment totality, \nand even the environment in general, can be provided with an availability \nwhich is circumspectively oriented ; and not only this : establishing a sign \ncan, above all, reveal. What gets taken as a sign becomes accessible only \nthrough its readiness-to-hand. If, for instance, the south wind 'is accepted' \n[\"gilt\"] by the farmer as a sign of rain, then this 'acceptance' [\"Geltung\"] \n-or the 'value' with which the entity is 'invested'-is not a sort of bonus \nover and above what is already present-at-hand in itself-viz, the flow of \nair in a definite geographical direction. The south wind may be meteoro\u00ad\nlogically accessible as something which just occurs ; but it is never present-\n1 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  das \"was kommt\" ist solches, daraufwir uns gefasst machen, bzw. \"nicht gefast \nwaren\", sofern wir uns mit anderem befasten.' \nI 'Das Merkzeichen zeigt, \"woran\" man jeweils ist. Die Zeichen zeigen primir immer \ndas, \"worin\" man lebt, wobei das Besorgen sich aufhaJ.t, welche Bewandtnis es damit \nhat.' On 'Bewandtnis', see note 2, p. 1 15 H. 84 below. \n8 See H. 75-76 above. \n"

      "full_text": "Being and Time \nI I3 \ncloser inspection it becomes plain that to interpret fetishism and \nmagic by taking our clue from the idea of signs in general, is not enough \n82 \nto enable us to grasp the kind of 'Being-ready-to-hand' which belongs to \nentities encountered in the primitive world. With regard to the sign\u00ad\nphenomenon, the following Interpretation may be given: for primitive \nman, the sign coincides with that which is indicated. Not only can the \nsign represent this in the sense of serving as a substitute for what it indic-\nates, but it can do so in such a way that the sign itself always is what it \nindicates. This remarkable coinciding does not mean, however, that the \nsign-Thing has already undergone a certain 'Objectification'-that it has \nbeen experienced as a mere Thing and misplaced into the same realm of \nBeing of the present-at-hand as what it indicates. This 'coinciding' is not \nan identification of things which have hitherto been isolated from each \nother : it consists rather in the fact that the sign has not as yet become free \nfrom that of which it is a sign. Such a use of signs is still absorbed com\u00ad\npletely in Being-towards what is indicated, so that a sign as such cannot \ndetach itself at all. This coinciding is based not on a prior Objectification \nbut on the fact that such Objectification is completely lacking. This means, \nhowever, that signs are not discovered as equipment at all-that ultimately \nwhat is 'ready-to-hand' within-the-world just does not have the kind of \nBeing that belongs to equipment. Perhaps\u00b7 even readiness-to-hand and \nequipment have nothing to contribute [nichts auszurichten] as ontological \nclues in Interpreting the primitive world ; and certainly the ontology of \nThing hood does even less. But if an understanding of Being is constitutive \nfor primitive Dasein and for the primitive world in general, then it is all \nthe more urgent to work out the 'formal' idea of worldhood-<>r at least \nthe idea of a phenomenon modifiable in such a way that all ontological \nassertions to the effect that in a given phenomenal context something is \nnot yet such-and-such or no longer such-and-such, may acquire a positive \nphenomenal meaning in terms of what it is not.1 \nThe foregoing Interpretation of the sign should merely provide phe\u00ad\nnomenal support for our characterization of references or assignments. \nThe relation between sign and reference is threefold. 1 .  Indicating, as a \nway whereby the \"towards-which\" of a serviceability can become con\u00ad\ncrete, is founded upon the equipment-structure as \u00b7such, upon the \"in\u00ad\norder-to\" (assignment). 2. The indicating which the sign does is an \nequipmental character of something ready-to-hand, and as such it belongs \nto a totality of equipment, to a context of assignments or references. \n3\u00b7 The sign is not only ready-to-hand with other equipment, but in its \nreadiness-to-hand the environment becomes in each case explicitly \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n aus dem, was es nicht ist.' The older editions write 'w as' for 'was'. \n"

Anything ready-to-hand is, at the worst, \nappropriate for some purposes and inappropriate for others ; and its \n'properties' are, as it were, still bound up in these ways in which it is \nappropriate or inappropriate, 1 just as presence-at-hand, as a possible \nkind of Being for something ready-to-hand, is bound up in readiness-to\u00ad\nhand. Serviceability too, however, as a constitutive state of equipment \n(and serviceability is a reference), is not an appropriateness of some \nentity; it is rather the condition (so far as Being is in question) which \nmakes it possible for the character of such an entity to be defined by its \nappropriatenesses. But what, then, is \"reference\" or \"assignment\" to \nmean ? To say that the Being of the ready-to-hand has the structure of \nassignment or reference means that it has in itself the character of hauing \n84 \nbeen assigned or referred [Verwiesenheit]. An entity is discovered when it has \nbeen assigned or referred to something, and ,referred as that entity which \nit is. With any such entity there is an involvement which it has in some\u00ad\n:hing. 2 The character of Being which belongs to the ready-to-hand is \nust such an inuoluement. If something has an involvement, this implies \netting it be involved in something. The relationship ofthe \"with . . .  in . . . \" \nhall be indicated by the term \"assignment\" or \"reference\". 3 \n1 The words 'property' and 'appropriateness' reflect the etymological connection of \n[eidegger's 'Eigenschaft' and \"Geeignetheit'. \nz 'Es hat mit ihm bei etwas sein Bewenden.' The terms 'Bewenden' and 'Bewandtnis' are \nmong the most difficult for the translator. Their root meaning has to do with the way \n>mething is already 'turning' when one lets it 'go its own way', 'run its course', follow \ns 'bent' or 'tendency', or finish 'what it is about', 'what it is up to' or 'what it is \nlVolved in'. The German expressions, however, have no simple English equivalents, \nut are restricted to a rather special group of idioms such as the following, which we \nave taken from Wildhagen and Heraucourt's admirable English-Gmnan, Gmnan-English \n>ictionary (Volume II, Wiesbaden 1953) : 'es dabei bewenden lasen'-'to leave it at \n1at, to let it go at that, to let it rest there' ; 'und dabei hatte es sein Bewenden'-'and \n[}ere the matter ended'; 'dabei muss es sein Bewenden haben'-'there the matter must \nest'-'that must suffice' ; 'die Sache hat eine ganz andere Bewandtnis'-'the case is \ntuite different' ; 'damit hat es seine besondere Bewaridtnis'-'there is something peculiar \n,bout it; thereby hangs a tale' ; 'damit hat est folgende Bewandtnis'-'the matter \ns as follows'. \nWe have tried to render both 'Bewenden' and 'Bewandtnis' by expressions including \n!ither 'involve' or 'involvement'. But the contexts into which these words can easily be \nfitted in ordinary English do not correspond very well to those which are possible for \n'Bewenden' and 'Bewandtnis'. Our task is further complicated by the emphasis which \nHeidegger gives to the prepositions 'mit' and 'bei' in connection with 'Bewenden' and \n'Bewandtnis'. In passages such as the present one, it would be more idiomatic to leave \nthese prepositions untranslated and simply write : 'Any such entity is involved in doing \nsomething', or 'Any such entity is involved in some activity'. But 'mit' and \u00b7\u032dei' receive so \nmuch attention in this connection that in contexts such as this we shall sometimes translate \nthem as 'with' and 'in', though elsewhere we shall handle 'bei' very differently. (The \nreader must bear in mind that the kind of 'involvement' with which we are here concerned \nis always an involvement in some activiry, which one is performing, not an involvement \nin circumstances in which one is 'caught' or 'entangled'.) \n3 'In Bewandtnis liegt: bewenden lasen mit etwas bei etwas.

      "full_text": "u6 \nBeing and Time \nWhen an entity within-the-world has already been proximally freed \nfor its Being, that Being is its \"involvement\". With any such entity as \nentity, there is some involvement. The fact that it has such an involvement \nis ontological?J definitive for the Being of such an entity, and is not an \nontical assertion about it. That in which it is involved is the \"towards\u00ad\nwhich\" of serviceability, and the \"for-which\" of usability.1 With the \n\"towards-which\" of serviceability there can again be an involvement: \nwith this thing, for instance, which is ready-to-hand, and which we \naccordingly call a \"hamer\", there is an involvement in hammering; \nwith hammering, there is an involvement in making something fast; \nwith making something fast, there is an involvement in protection against \nbad weather ; and this protection 'is' for the sake of [ um-willen] providing \nshelter for Dasein-that is to say, for the sake of a possibility of Dasein's \nBeing. Whenever something ready-to-hand has an involvement with it, \nwhat involvement this is, has in each case been outlined in advance in \nterms of the totality of such involvements. In a workshop, for example, the \ntotality of involvements which is constitutive for the ready-to-hand in its \nreadiness-to-hand, is 'earlier' than any single item of equipment; so too \nfor the farmstead with all its utensils and outlying lands. But the totality \nof involvements itself goes back ultimately to a \"towards-which\" in \nwhich there is no further involvement : this \"towards-which\" is not an \nentity with the kind of Being that belongs to what is ready-to-hand within \na world ; it is rather an entity whose Being is defined as Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, and to whose state of Being, worldhood itselfbelongs. This primary \n\"towards-which\" is not just another \"towards-this\" as something in which \nan involvement is possible. The primary 'towards-which' is a \"for-the\u00ad\nsake-of-which\".2 But the 'for-the-sake-of' always pertains to the Being of \n. . .  bei . . . \" soil durch den Terminus Verweisung angezeigt werden.' Here the point seems \nto be that if something has an 'involvement' in the sense of 'Bewandtnis' (or rather, if \nthere is such an involvement 'with' it), the thing which has this involvement has been \n'assigned' or 'referred' for a certain activity or purpose 'in' which it may be said to be \ninvolved. \n1 'Bewandtnis ist das Sein des innerweltlichen Seienden, darauf es je schon zunachst \nfreigegeben ist. Mit ihm als Seiendem hat es je eine Bewandtnis. Dieses, clas es eine \nBewandtnis hat, ist die ontologische Bestimmung des Seins dieses Seienden, nicht eine \nontische Aussage tiber das Seiende. Das Wobei es die Bewandtnis hat, ist das Wozu der \nDienlichkeit, das Wofiir der Verwendbarkeit.' This passage and those which follow are \nhard to translate because Heidegger is using three carefully differentiated prepositions \n('zu', 'fur', and 'auf') where English idiom needs only 'for'. We can say that something is \nserviceable, usable, or applicable 'for' a purpose. and that it may be freed or given free \nrein 'for' some kind of activity. In German, however, it will be said to have 'Dienlichkeit \nzu \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ', 'Verwendbarkeitfur . . .  '; and it will be 'freigegeben arif \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n '. In the remainder of \nthis section we shall use 'for' both for 'fiir' and for 'auf' as they occur in these expressions; \nwe shall, however, continue to use 'towards-which' for the 'Wozu' of 'Dienlichkeit'. Se \nnote 1, p. 109, H. 78 above. \n11 'Dieses primare Wozu ist kein Dazu als mi>gliches Wobei einer Bewandtnis. Das \nprimare \"Wozu\" ist ein Worum-willen.' \n"
