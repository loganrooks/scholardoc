The fact remains that Monsieur \nTeste, to come back to him, this \ufb01 ctional character, this marionette, is, like \nhis narrator, not only a man qua man (homo) who has sworn the death in \nhimself of the pigheaded b\u00ea tise of the marionette, he is also a man qua man \n(sieur, vir), a Monsieur (in the \ufb01 liation of sieur, a contraction of seigneur \n[lord]), he is a sir, or even a bourgeois sovereign, a Monsieur, a man whose \nvirility never misses a chance to call attention to itself or to call to order.\nWhat order?\nWell, the order of the sexes.\nThe narrator and he, as we noted, sometimes meet in a brothel.\nAs soon as he has said, and they were his \ufb01 rst words, \u201cLa b\u00ea tise n\u2019est \npas mon fort,\u201d the narrator or spokesman of Monsieur Teste enumerates, \nas though he were reaching the end of his life as he is writing his memoirs, \neverything he has done. And indeed they are acts, doings [faits et gestes], that \nhe always recalls in the \ufb01 rst person. With active and transitive verbs in the \n\ufb01 rst person. Things don\u2019t happen to him, he does them and makes them \nhappen, he is an \u201cI,\u201d an \u201cI,\u201d who always acts, always does this or that. And \namong all that \u201cI have done,\u201d all that the \u201cI\u201d does, there is a \u201cI have touched \non women\u201d [j\u2019ai touch\u00e9 \u00e0 des femmes], the grammar of which is, once again, \ndif\ufb01 cult to translate. He does not even say: \u201cI have touched women,\u201d but \u201cI \nhave touched on women.\u201d Listen to all these connotations in the narrator\u2019s \nmouth. From the start, from the opening, as soon as the narrator opens his \nmouth \u2014 because all this is principally a question of the mouth, as you are \ngoing to see \u2014 it is to say:\nB\u00ea tise is not my strong point. I have seen many individuals; I have visited \na few nations; I have played my part in diverse enterprises without loving \nthem; I have eaten almost every day; I have touched on women.23\nThis sequence is full of symptomatic signatures. Through the disappointed \nand condescending disdain of the blas\u00e9 Monsieur, the gentleman with no il-\nlusions, who says in the past tense: [Oh], I\u2019ve seen many individuals [anony-\nmous and sexually undifferentiated crowd]), I\u2019ve visited a few nations, I\u2019ve \nplayed my part in diverse enterprises without loving them [admire the statis-\n22.

We may say that Monsieur Teste\u2019s double fait la moue, we \nsee his mouth faire la moue, we see a kind of disgusted grimace accompany \neverything he says. This can go as far as repulsion, aversion, a silent but elo-\nquent manifestation of impotent rejection, sometimes in situations of utter \nextremity. Montaigne says that among the North American Indians, \u201cthe \nprisoner [spits] in the faces of those who kill him and fait la moue at them.26 \nAnd so Monsieur Teste recognizes,27 after having said \u201cI have eaten almost \nevery day,\u201d that \u201cI have touched [on] women.\u201d\nThis man who has sovereignly touched [on] women is the double or \nspokesman of Monsieur Teste, who is not only a man but a husband. And \nthe narrator is not only the double of Monsieur Teste, he presents him-\nself as doubled, tripled, multiplied. Read carefully all that follows, the two \npages before the narrative of the encounter with Monsieur Teste, in par-\nticular what concerns his self- multiplication, this \u201carithmetic\u201d (his word) \nthat counts with self, counts out the self, calculates or tallies up his own \nmultiplicity. For example, in the paragraph that follows the one we have \njust read, and after speaking of something that remains (\u201cwhat could re-\nmain did so\u201d), the narrator tells of the pro\ufb01 t, the saving, the economy that \nhe \ufb01 nds in this arithmetic. This accounting of the self, as you will hear, \nnot only allows him a certain economy of self, a wisdom that allows him \nto tolerate himself and grow old with himself, but also discreetly opens \nthe  quasi- in\ufb01 nite \ufb01 eld of a hyperbolic upping of the ante that gives him \na right and a power superior to sovereignty, superior to that of superior \nmen, more than sovereign, in sum, more than superior, as it were. This \nis a superiority that can no longer restrain itself, both in\ufb01 nitely cunning \nand in\ufb01 nitely b\u00eate. This is in any case how I would interpret the following \nlines: (Read and comment)\nI have retained neither the best nor the worst of these things: what could \nremain remained.\n \nThis arithmetic spares me from being astonished at growing old.

It is men who speak and have the right to \nspeech. And when they consent to allow a woman, Madame \u00c9milie Teste, \nto speak, it is so that she will write, among other things, these three or four \nmotifs, from which I\u2019ll have to content myself for the moment with a few \nquotations (we shall come back to them next time, but I recommend that \nyou read them all, because you will \ufb01 nd much more than I can bring out \nhere, in the little time left).\nFirst motif, the hardness of Monsieur Teste according to Madame \u00c9milie \nTeste, but a hardness so hard that it changes back into its opposite:\nThe machine of his monotonous acts explodes; his face shines; he says \nthings that very often I only half understand, but which never fade from \nmy memory. But I wish to hide nothing from you, or almost nothing: he is \nsometimes very hard. I do not think anyone can be as hard as he is. He breaks \nyour spirit with one word, and I see myself as a failed vase, which the pot-\nter throws into the trash. He is as hard as an angel, Monsieur. He does not \nrealize his force: he says unexpected things that are too true, that annihilate \npeople, wake them up in the middle of their sottise, face to face with them-\nselves, completely trapped in what they are, living so naturally on idiocies.\n \n[. . .]\n \nBut do not imagine that he is always dif\ufb01 cult or overpowering. If you \nonly knew, Monsieur, how he can be quite different! . . . Of course he is \nhard sometimes; but at other times he adorns himself in an exquisite and \nsurprising sweetness that seems to come down from heaven. His smile is a \nmysterious and irresistible gift, and his rare tenderness a winter rose. How-\never, it is impossible to foresee either his ease or his violence. It is in vain \nthat one expects his rigors or his favors; he outplays by his profound distrac-\ntion and by the impenetrable order of his thoughts all the ordinary calcula-\ntions that humans make as to the character of their fellows.

Man can \nand should produce marionettes and even a marionette theater. Will we \nrush to say that those we call animals cannot do so? No. Of course, most \nof them, and most men too, don\u2019t produce a puppet show or Kleist\u2019s mari-\nonette theater. But are certain nonhuman animals capable of producing and \ngetting attached to simulacra, to masks, and to meaningful prosthetic sub-\nstitutes?

And this difference between two marionettes \nin the marionette is again one of the sexual differences we have been talking \nabout since the beginning of the seminar.\nLast time I recalled that most often, in our typical representation of the \nmarionette, what insistently came to the fore was the feminine \ufb01 gure of the \nsmall and the young, the little girl, the touching young girl, even the virgin, \nthe Virgin Mary (mariole, mariolette). With the grace, innocence, and spon-\ntaneity that usually go with that.\nBut as you have no doubt already sensed, things are not so simple. In \ntruth, they are less simple than ever. As always when sexual differences \nare in play. (Incidentally, I\u2019ll venture to say to all those who \u2014 often in the \npress, as you know \u2014 speak ironically of people who, like me for example, \nare fond of issuing warnings, saying, \u201cThings are not so simple,\u201d those to \nwhom irony comes easily when they are faced with this systematic warning, \nI believe it\u2019s primarily because they want to hide from themselves, forget or \ndeny something to do with sexual differences. There\u2019s always a clandestine \ndebate raging about sexual differences.) So, as I was saying about the mari-\nonette as little girl or young innocent virgin full of grace, things are not so \nsimple. And if they are not simple, it is because of the equivocality of the \nliving being, precisely, where the living being concentrates, as though into \n25.

The living being is automotive, autonomous, abso-\nlutely spontaneous, sovereignly automotive, and at the same time perfectly \nprogrammed like an automatic re\ufb02 ex. I insist on this paradox to put back \non stage the eminently phallic \ufb01 gure of the marionette, the phallic erection \nthat comes to inhabit, haunt, and double that of the virgin girl. The virgin \ngirl is inhabited by motion, movement, the essentially phallic law of the \nmarionette. What does this mean?\nThe point is not just to say that the marionette is erect, because it is up-\nright, tensed, hard as wood, made of wood (hard, as Madame \u00c9milie Teste \ninsisted, like the hardness of her husband Monsieur Teste, hardness, i.e. \nalso stiffness, rigidity, or again, as in \u201cThe Meridian,\u201d quoting B\u00fcchner: \n\u201cNothing but art and mechanics, nothing but cardboard and springs!\u201d27): \nwe should not only say that the marionette is erect, because it is upright, \ntensed, hard as wood and that it stands on the stage, etc., like an instrument, \na thingamajig [machin], or an operated machine, content to react mechani-\ncally, always a little stif\ufb02 y, to what is mechanically acting on it. Like an actor \ntoo, an actor or a mask, a simulacrum, a substitute actor that is acted as much \nas it acts, operated, hard- wired (as they say about animal behavior) down to \nthe slightest reaction, etc. This is true, of course, and one could go far in this \ndirection of straight and direct erection, and compare the  quasi- mechanical \nautomatism of the marionette machine in the hands of its puppeteer to the \nre\ufb02 ex, one might almost say the re\ufb02 ex and  quasi- automatic reaction of the \nphallic erection, what presents itself as hard, straight, standing, stiff, and \nrigid. And from this facile comparison one could indeed conclude that the \nmarionette is a sort of metaphor or \ufb01 gure, a sort of phallic trope. It makes \nyou think of the phallus, even though it\u2019s sometimes still a girl, and the \ntaste, fascination, modes, and genres that cultivate the marionette or the \nmarionette theater would thus be participating in the cult of the phallus. \nOne could indeed follow things quite a long way down this road.\nBut in truth it is also the very opposite that we now have to recall.

To limit myself provisionally \nto vocabulary, we know that we are going to \ufb01 nd the marionettes again, of \ncourse, more than once, and heads, many heads, monarch\u2019s heads in par-\nticular, and revolutionary decapitations, we know that we are going to \ufb01 nd \nagain the majesty I was just talking about, and above all a Medusa\u2019s head, \nwhich I don\u2019t need to recall \u2014 though I will in a moment \u2014 the apotropaic \nrelation it has (and that Freud recalls in Das Medusenhaupt)28 to petri\ufb01 ed \nerection and the threat of castration.\nHere perhaps, in the comic or derisory aspect of erection, is where the \nexperience of b\u00eatise returns. In what remains comic about it, enough to \nmake you die laughing. One cannot think of the Greek phallus without \nassociating it with Priapus, or even priapism. I note \ufb01 rst that Freud, who \noften speaks of the phallic, the phallic phase, the phallic mother, etc., rarely \nspeaks, in fact almost never, of the phallus itself under this common noun. \nHe uses the adjective \u201cphallic,\u201d and almost never the noun \u201cphallus.\u201d One \nof the very rare occurrences, if not the only exception, is precisely in a his-\ntorical reference to Priapus\u2019s phallus in \u201cThe Taboo of Virginity.\u201d29 To show \nthat people were fearful of the threat that weighed on whoever de\ufb02 owered \ngirls, Freud recalls that in India young wives had \ufb01 rst to sacri\ufb01 ce their hy-\nmen on a wooden lingam (again a kind of marionette) and that this custom \ncan also be found among the Romans. He then mentions Saint Augustine\u2019s \ncomment that the newlywed wife at least had to sit on what Freud calls \u201ca \ngigantic stone phallus of Priapus.\u201d You know that the principal attribute of \nPriapus, who was often held to be the son of Dionysus and Aphrodite or \na nymph, was that he was endowed, even af\ufb02 icted, with an outsize phal-\nlic member, and we must say phallus rather than penis because this penis \nwas outsize precisely because it was, or insofar as it was, uncontrollable by \nthe subject, in permanent and irrepressible erection, that is, ithyphallic as \nit is sometimes called and as one should always call it: the ithyphallos is the \nhardness of the straight, rigid, standing phallus (ithus is straight, inciden-\ntally also in the sense of rectitude).

Terrible (terribilis says Columella in his \nAgriculture, 10.33),30 terrible, terrifying, terrorizing, and comic all at once. \nThere would be a lot to say about this derision, this comic or mocking di-\nmension in the ef\ufb01 gies of the ithyphallic god sometimes daubed with red \nand shouting obscenities. It was said of this quasi- god in constant erection \nthat he was born of an ass and was like an ass. Lactantius tells of a competi-\ntion to see which of the two, Priapus or the ass, has the bigger member. The \nass wins, beats Priapus, but to avenge himself Priapus kills the ass.31 Here, \ninsinuating itself, we see the hypothesis that a mark of b\u00eatise always threat-\nens the presumed superiority of a constant and imperturbable erection. I \nshall call this, very seriously, ithyphallic b\u00eatise, the essential, nonaccidental \nb\u00eatise that characterizes the phallic as such (and so sovereignty as such, of \nwhich the ithyphallic is the attribute). It is like a marionette whose re\ufb02 ex \nspring and uncontrollable automaticity never let up. The ithyphallus is a \nmarionette, whose hyperbolic desire is both nil and empty of thought and of \nits own drive, of course, but it is this void that nonetheless pushes it, pulses \nand compulses it, it is what promises, promotes, and makes one think of a \ndrive that is absolutely b\u00eate, ent\u00eat\u00e9, that never gives anything up, that is an \nabsolute stranger to all thought.\nI am not sure that Aristotle suspected this, but it is he who, intrigued by \nthe phenomenon of erection, worried about what might happen if by mis-\nfortune (and it is this misfortune I am venturing to call b\u00eatise) the erection \nbecame permanent. That would be not only ridiculous and would not only \nmake us laugh, as in the rituals and jokes I have just been talking about, \nbut, says Aristotle (in The Parts of Animals 689a 25\u201327), it would consti-\ntute an unnatural hindrance. Perhaps tolerable for beasts and for demigods, \nthis imperturbable and impassive erection would produce in men only im-\npotence without the emission of semen, and thus without generative power, \nand would produce only pain without enjoyment. The pathology called \npriapism leads to death. And priapism is in\ufb01 nite ithyphallism, ithyphallism \nforeign to that detumescence that is the \ufb01 nitude of erection and that, as such, \nmakes possible the time of erection \u2014 which it threatens, of course, but to \n30. Quoted by Maurice Olender, \u201cPriape, le dernier des dieux,\u201d in Dictionnaire des \nmythologies, 2:312; trans. as \u201cPriapus: The Last of the Gods,\u201d in Mythologies, comp. Yves \nBonnefoy, 1:629. \n31.

A priapic, i.e. permanent and inde\ufb01 nite, \nerection is no longer even an erection \u2014 and it is a mortal pathology.\nBut is detumescence castration? Instead of taking on this immense ques-\ntion frontally, it\u2019s time to return to \u201cThe Meridian,\u201d which we have, in fact, \nkept obliquely in view since the beginning of this session. What is said in it \nabout the marionette, about the Medusa\u2019s head, about heads in general, and \nabout majesty allows for a fairly well- justi\ufb01 ed transition. But I should also \nlike to emphasize the Foreigner (Fremde), the Other (Andere), and the famil-\niar or worrying estrangement (Unheimliche). I had to choose between a con-\ntinuous reading of Celan\u2019s \u201cSpeech,\u201d an interpretation that would follow the \napparent order and linear time of the text, its very consecution, and another, \nless diachronic, more systematic reading, which would be concerned, for the \npurposes of demonstration, to bring out a con\ufb01 guration of motifs, words, \nand themes, \ufb01 gures that usually do not appear in this order. I have of course \ntaken this second course, [on the one hand] because we won\u2019t have time to \nread together, in a linear way, the whole text from A to Z (though I recom-\nmend that you do so yourselves), and, on the other hand, because the actively \ninterpretative, selective, and directed reading I am about to propose to you \nrequires it. You understand that I do not hold this interpretative reading to \nbe the only or even the best possible one, but it doesn\u2019t seem impossible, and \nit is important to me in the perspective of this seminar.\nEven before looking (too quickly, of course) at the motifs that I am \nproposing to articulate together (even though Celan does not do so explic-\nitly) \u2014 namely art, the marionette or the automat, the Medusa\u2019s head, heads \nin general, and majesty, the Foreigner, and the Unheimliche \u2014 I have two \npreliminary remarks.\nFirst preliminary remark. There is a lot about dates in this text, which is \nalso a sort of poetics of the date. When I devoted a little book to it some \ufb01 f-\nteen years ago (Schibboleth),32 I made it into a privileged object of re\ufb02 ection \nand analysis or interpretation, especially around a certain January 20 that \nrecurs regularly, at least three times, in the text (B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz, \u201cthe Lenz \nwho \u2018on January 20 was walking through the mountains,\u2019 \u201d33 then \u201cPerhaps \nwe can say that every poem keeps inscribed within it its \u2018January 20,\u2019 \u201d34 then \n32.

      "full_text": "226  \u2021  eighth session\n\u201cI had myself written from a \u2018January 20,\u2019 my \u2018January 20\u2019 \u201d).35 I insistently \nelaborated on these dates, on the question of anniversaries and the calendar, \nand on this example of the \u201cJanuary 20\u201d in Schibboleth. But it is thanks \nto Jean Launay\u2019s edition (so precious and exemplary, as I have said) that \nI was able to discover a further import to this \u201cJanuary 20.\u201d Referring to \nCelan\u2019s manuscript, Launay tells us in a note36 that \u201cJanuary 20 is also the \nday in 1942 of the so- called Wannsee conference in Berlin, during which \nHitler and his collaborators drew up the plans for the \u2018\ufb01 nal solution.\u2019 \u201d And \nhere is the translation of the passage from Celan\u2019s manuscript: \u201cWe are still \nwriting, still today, January 20 \u2014 this January 20 [this underlined, \u2018diesen \n20, J\u00e4nner\u2019], to which has been added since then the writing of so much \n[so many days of] ice\u201d (\u201czu dem sich [seitdem] soviel Eisiges hinzugeschrieben \nhat\u201d). \u201cJanuary 20,\u201d an anniversary of death, then, of crime against human-\nity, of a sovereignly, arbitrarily genocidal decision. \u201cJanuary 20,\u201d the eve \nof the anniversary of the decapitation of the monarch, Louis XVI, about \nwhom a lot is said, between the repetitions of \u201cLong live the King\u201d of Lucile \nand Lenz, to which we shall return.\nSecond preliminary remark. The apparently surprising contiguity between \nour readings of Monsieur Teste and \u201cThe Meridian,\u201d texts that are, how-\never, so different, so distant through so many features \u2014 this contiguity or \nproximity of two texts that are apparently so anachronistic with respect to \neach other is justi\ufb01 ed not only, beyond mere juxtaposition, by the fact that \nthey both, each in its own way, treat of the marionette and everything that \nis attached to it. The fact is that Val\u00e9ry is not simply absent from \u201cThe \nMeridian.\u201d Celan wonders at a certain moment, on the subject of a radical \nquestioning of art, if one must not \u201cthink Mallarm\u00e9 through to his ultimate \nconsequences?\u201d (\u201cMallarm\u00e9 konsequent zu Ende denken?\u201d). Here too a long \nnote by Launay37 puts us on the track of a manuscript of Celan\u2019s that refers \nto a passage by Val\u00e9ry in Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s. Here, Val\u00e9ry quotes something Mallarm\u00e9 \nsaid to poor Degas, who was complaining about not \ufb01 nishing his little poem \nwhen he was \u201cfull of ideas.\u201d Mallarm\u00e9, as Val\u00e9ry reports, replied: \u201cBut De-\ngas, it is not with ideas that poetry is made, but with words.\u201d And Val\u00e9ry \nconcludes: \u201cThat is a great lesson.\u201d38\nLet us now try, around or through the con\ufb01 guration I have announced \n35.

You know that the concept of encounter, the \u201csecret of the encoun-\nter\u201d we were just talking about (Geheimnis der Begegnung), is the secret of \nthe poem, of the presence or the putting into presence or the presentation \nof the poem, the secret of the encounter as secret of the poem in the double \nsense of the term \u201csecret of\u201d: in the sense of what, on the one hand, \ufb01 rst, \nmakes a poem, in the sense of its manufacture, its making, its possibility of \ntaking form, if not of its art and its know- how, I prefer to say its signature \n(that is, the secret as genesis of the poem, its condition of possibility, as when \nwe say, \u201cThat guy has the secret,\u201d implying the art of something or other, \nthough here it is not essentially art that holds the secret of this act or rather \nthis event, it is the encounter) and then \u2014 the double sense of secret \u2014 on \nthe other hand, secondly, as what in the present itself \u2014 in the very presenta-\ntion of the poem, in this present now on which Celan insists so much, in the \nexperience of the encounter \u2014 still remains secret, at bottom like a present \nthat does not present itself, a phenomenon that does not phenomenalize \nitself. Nothing shows up, the nothing, the absurd shows up in manifesting \nnothing. We shall get to this manifestation as nonmanifestation.\nBut I think I know from having read this poem so often that its trajec-\ntory follows a line that de\ufb01 es all reconstitution in the form of logical or nar-\nrative exposition. The few initial sketches or sidesteps [esquisses ou esquives] \nthat I am proposing to you today are really only an invitation to take a look, \nto go get your eyes and hands involved in it yourselves, to encounter the \npoem. The line (I keep the word \u201cline,\u201d but we shall have to say \u201clink\u201d in \na moment, for the line is a link, Verbindende), the line as a link that links to \nthe other, the Thou in the encounter, the line as link that I am seeking to \ndraw or reconstitute is, moreover, the very thing that is being sought, that \nCelan admits having sought for during this journey, on this path that he \ndescribes at the end \u2014 and I shall basically be setting out from this, i.e. at \nthe end, from the end \u2014 [that Celan describes, then] as an \u201cimpossible path\u201d \nor a \u201cpath of the impossible.\u201d Moreover, an \u201cimpossible path\u201d and a \u201cpath \nof the impossible\u201d are not exactly the same thing.

This line is a link that leads to the encounter (Be-\ngegnung), to your encounter, the encounter of you, the nomination of Thou, \nwhereby he will more than once have named the poem and the present of \nthe poem. But before continuing this quotation to the end, I would like, \nvia a few returns, three returns, as I said, to show you how this \u201cin your \npresence\u201d (in Ihrer Gegenwart) was not a conventional concession (there are \nnone in this extraordinary text). This \u201cin your presence\u201d (in Ihrer Gegen-\nwart) was already invested, charged, made more serious by the question of \nthe poem, the poem in its dif\ufb01 cult and tumultuous settling of scores with \nart, the question that bears on art and the question that bears on poetry \n(\u201cFrage nach der Kunst und nach der Dichtung,\u201d said Celan earlier, adding, \u201cI \nhave approached B\u00fcchner, consciously, if not voluntarily, with my question \nabout art and literature \u2014 one question among many \u2014 in order to identify \nhis question\u201d).40 Now this question becomes that of the poem, determined \nby Celan as present and presence, as now and presence.\nFirst return, toward what exactly the word \u201cMajesty\u201d implies in the very \nessence or rather the event, the chance, of poetry.
