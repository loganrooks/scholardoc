B\u00eatise here, stubborn \n b\u00eatise, I would say without further commenting on Heidegger, would be \nnot to know how to leave Being to be what it really is, but to rush excitably \ntoward the question, giving in to the compulsion, to the question as excit-\nable, nervous compulsion, wanting- to- know [vouloir- savoir] by accumula-\ntive curiosity; for there is without doubt a b\u00eatise of the question, as there \n1.

Instead the decisive fact is that, together with the \nprocess by which the exception everywhere becomes the rule, the realm of \nbare life \u2014 which is originally situated at the margins of the political or-\nder \u2014 gradually begins to coincide with the political realm, and exclusion \nand inclusion, outside and inside, bios and zo\u00e9, right and fact, enter into a \nzone of irreducible indistinction.14\nWhat is dif\ufb01 cult to sustain, in this thesis, is the idea of an entry (a modern \nentry, then) into a zone of irreducible indifferentiation, when the differ-\nentiation has never been secure (I would say Agamben furtively admits as \nmuch); and, above all, what remains even more dif\ufb01 cult to sustain is the \nidea that there is in this something modern or new; for Agamben himself, as \nyou are about to hear, taking the Foucauldian idea of a speci\ufb01 cally modern \nbiopolitics seriously, [Agamben] is keen to recall that it is as ancient as can \n12.

Prudently, \nHeidegger notes that one ought to distinguish here between the Synop-\ntics and the Gospel of John, but he considers that, essentially, at bottom \n(grund s\u00e4tzlich), the New Testament logos does not mean, as in Heraclitus \nfor example, the Being of the entity (das Sein des Seienden), the gathering of \nantagonistic forces (die Gesammeltheit des Gegenstrebigen). The logos of John \ndoes not signify the Being of the entity or what holds contraries together, \nbut designates one particular entity (\u201cein besonderes Seiendes\u201d: Heidegger \nemphasizes \u201cone\u201d), namely the son of God, in his mediating function be-\ntween God and man.\nThis accident of the logos, this drift that distances the logos from its Greek \noriginarity is, moreover, a Jewish heritage since, quite rarely for Heidegger, \nhe judges it necessary, in one sentence, to identify, uncover, or even to de-\nnounce, in this representation of the logos as mediator, the \ufb01 liation or in\ufb02 u-\nence of what he calls a representation, \u201cthat of the Jewish philosophy of \nreligion\u201d (\u201cdiejenige der j\u00fcdischen Religionsphilosophie\u201d) [he doesn\u2019t say the \nJewish religion but the Jewish philosophy of religion], here that of Philo \nthe Jew. Philo, in his philosophy of the creation, Heidegger reminds us, had \nindeed attributed to the logos the function of mesite\u00afs, mediator. This read-\ning of the evangelical logos under the in\ufb02 uence of Greco- Jewish philosophy, \nunder the in\ufb02 uence of Hellenistic Judaism, basically, is of interest to us for \ntwo reasons as we try to put some order into our trousseau of canonical texts. \nOn the one hand, because in this Christian appropriation of the logos, what is \nat stake is the performative commandment; on the other hand, because what \nis at stake is life (life as zo\u00afe\u00af).\nHow so?\nA. Well, on the one hand, \ufb01 rst, then, in the translation of the Septuagint, in \nthe translation of what is called the Old Testament, logos is the name given \nto the word of God as commandment (Befehl, Gebot). The \u201cten command-\nments\u201d is translated as \u201coi deka logoi.\u201d This is, as it is called, the Decalogue. \n \n426\n"

Logos tou staurou, the logos of the cross, is the \nword come from the cross. The Gospel of the Cross is Christ himself.\nB.

He incarnates the logos that he has.\nThese statements of Heidegger\u2019s, like the Introduction to Metaphysics, \ndate from 1935, from courses given in Freiburg.

Heidegger wants \ufb01 rst of all to show that the determina-\ntion of man as a rational animal is insuf\ufb01 ciently humanist, as it were, that it \nmisses the humanity of man, what is proper to man. And what thus misses \nthe essence of man is metaphysics.\n2. Second stage. Heidegger denounces the biologism, the biologistic re-\nduction of this de\ufb01 nition of man. And that means that the metaphysics of \nclassical humanism, the metaphysics that is not humanistic enough, is, deep \ndown, the ally or accomplice of biologism and zoologism.\nMetaphysics does not ask about the truth of Being itself. Nor does it there-\nfore ask in what way the essence of man belongs to the truth of Being. \nMetaphysics has not only failed up to now to ask this question, the question \nis inaccessible to metaphysics as metaphysics [Diese Frage ist der Metaphysik \nals Metaphysic unzug\u00e4nglich]. Being is still waiting for the time when it will \nbecome thought- provoking [denkw\u00fcrdig: worthy of thought] to man. With \nregard to the de\ufb01 nition of man\u2019s essence, however one may determine the \nratio or the animal and the reason of the living being, whether as a \u201cfaculty \nof principles\u201d [Verm\u00f6gen der Prinzipien] or a \u201cfaculty of categories\u201d [Verm\u00f6-\ngen der Kategorien], or in some other way, the essence of reason is always \nand in each case grounded in this: for every apprehending of beings in their \nBeing, Being itself is already illumined and comes to pass in its truth. So \ntoo with animal, zo\u00afon, an interpretation of \u201clife\u201d is already posited which \nnecessarily lies in an interpretation of beings as zo\u00afe\u00af and physis, within which \nwhat is living appears. Above and beyond everything else, however, it \ufb01 -\nnally remains to ask whether the essence of man [das Wesen des Menschen] \nprimordially and most decisively lies in the dimension of animalitas at all \n[in der Dimension der animalitas]. Are we really on the right track toward \nthe essence of man as long as we set him off as one living creature among \nothers in contrast to plants, beasts, and God? We can proceed in that way; \nwe can in such fashion locate man within being as one being among others. \nWe will thereby always be able to state something correct about man. But \nwe must be clear on this point, that when we do this we abandon man to the \nessential realm of animalitas [in den Wesensbereich der animalitas] even if we \ndo not equate him with beasts but attribute a speci\ufb01 c difference to him. In \nprinciple we are still thinking of homo animalis \u2014 even when anima [soul] is \nposited as animus sive mens [spirit or mind], and this in turn is later posited \nas subject, person or spirit [Geist]. Such positing is the manner of metaphys-\nics. But then the essence of man is too little heeded and not thought in its \norigin, the essential provenance that is always the essential future for his-\nYork: Harper and Row, 1977), pp. 193\u201342.

Nor is \nthe error of biologism [Die Verirrung des Biologismus] overcome by adjoin-\ning a soul to the human body, a mind to the soul, and the existential to the \nmind, and then louder than before singing the praises of the mind \u2014 only \nto let everything relapse into \u201clife- experience,\u201d with a warning that think-\ning by its in\ufb02 exible concepts disrupts the \ufb02 ow of life and that thought of \nBeing distorts existence [there are many enemies lurking here . . . ]. The \nfact that physiology and physiological chemistry can scienti\ufb01 cally investi-\ngate man as an organism is no proof that in this \u201corganic\u201d thing, that is, in \nthe body scienti\ufb01 cally explained, the essence of man consists. That has as \nlittle validity as the notion that the essence of nature has been discovered \nin atomic energy. It could even be that nature, in the face she turns toward \nman\u2019s technical mastery, is simply concealing her essence. Just as little as the \nessence of man consists in being an animal organism can this insuf\ufb01 cient \nde\ufb01 nition of man\u2019s essence be overcome or offset by out\ufb01 tting man with \na immortal soul, the power of reason, or the character of a person. In each \ninstance essence is passed over, and passed over on the basis of the same \nmetaphysical projection.21\nHere, of course, we\u2019re not getting into Heidegger\u2019s discourse on the animal, \non the beast that is weltarm: that would require much more time, and I \nhope to do it next year. Heidegger\u2019s propositions that I was concerned to \nrecall today so as to reconstitute a context, with a view to approaching the \nopening of Aristotle\u2019s politics on man the political animal, are propositions \nthat are quoted neither by Foucault (who practically never talks about Hei-\ndegger, not even when he introduces his problematic of biopower), nor by \n20.

Instead \nthe decisive fact is that, together with the process by which the exception \neverywhere becomes the rule, the realm of bare life \u2014 which is originally \nsituated at the margins of the political order \u2014 gradually begins to coincide \nwith the political realm, and exclusion and inclusion, outside and inside, \nbios and zo\u00afe\u00af, right and fact, enter into a zone of irreducible indistinction.25\nThe whole dif\ufb01 culty depends on the fact that Agamben wants absolutely \nto de\ufb01 ne the speci\ufb01 city of modern politics or biopolitics (which Foucault \nmakes his theme at the end of The Will to Knowledge and at least the pos-\nsibility of which Heidegger, let\u2019s say, didn\u2019t fail to think), Agamben wants \nabsolutely to de\ufb01 ne this speci\ufb01 city by putting his money on the concept of \n\u201cbare life,\u201d which he identi\ufb01 es with zo\u00afe\u00af, in opposition to bios.

Agamben continues:\nIn any case, however, the entry of zo\u00afe\u00af into the sphere of the polis \u2014 the po-\nliticization of bare life as such \u2014 constitutes the decisive event of modernity \nand signals a radical transformation of the political- philosophical catego-\nries of classical thought.

Well, to a forgetting. \nPolitics (the political thing or the thinking of politics) has forgotten. What? \n\u201cThe founding event of modernity,\u201d namely what founds modern politics \nand what politics has forgotten. Now what does this founding event consist \nin?

In, \nand I quote again, \u201cthe introduction of zo\u00afe\u00af] into the sphere of the polis.\u201d\nTo show this, Agamben is required to demonstrate that the difference \nbetween zo\u00afe\u00af and bios is absolutely rigorous, already in Aristotle. Can he do \nthis? Before proceeding down this path, I should like to take a precaution. \nMy questions or my reservations here, whether directed toward Foucault \nor, more precisely here, toward Agamben, don\u2019t mean that I have no inter-\nest in anything that could be called a speci\ufb01 city in the relations between the \nliving being and politics, in what these authors so calmly call \u201cmodernity.\u201d \nNew things are certainly happening in this respect today.\nAs they always are, aren\u2019t they?\nNo, my doubts and my dissatisfactions concern the concepts or the con-\nceptual strategies relied on in order to analyze and characterize these novel-\nties. I don\u2019t believe, for example, that the distinction between bios and zo\u00afe\u00af is \na reliable and effective instrument, suf\ufb01 ciently sharp and, to use Agamben\u2019s \nlanguage, which is not mine here, suf\ufb01 ciently deep to get to the depth of \nthis \u201c[so- called] founding event.\u201d Nor that the category of forgetting is suf-\n\ufb01 ciently pertinent here for a more or less competent philologist, capable \nof seeing the difference between bios and zo\u00afe\u00af, to reawaken politics to itself \ntoday and make it come out of its oblivion or its sleep. The more so in that \nsaid philologist must repeatedly recognize that not only did Aristotle, many \ncenturies ago, talk of zo\u00afon politikon (and that the \u201cplus\u201d: zo\u00afon + politikon is, \nas we shall see in a moment, a very fragile threshold), but that sometimes, \n26.

It can even be said that the production of a biopolitical body \nis the original activity of sovereign power. In this sense, biopolitics is at least as \nold as the sovereign exception.

Rather, I\u2019m tempted to think that this singularity \nof the event is all the more irreducible and confusing, as it should be, if we \ngive up that linear history which remains, in spite of all the protests they \nwould no doubt raise against this image, the common temptation of both \nFoucault and Agamben (the modernity that comes after the classical age, \nthe episte\u00afme\u00afs that follow on from each other and render each other obso-\nlete, Agamben who comes after Aristotle, etc.) \u2014 if we give up this linear \nhistory, the idea of a decisive and founding event (especially if we try to \nrethink and reevaluate the enduring and aporetic experience of what \u201cdeci-\nsion\u201d means in the logic of sovereign exception), if we give up the alterna-\ntive of synchronic and diachronic, an alternative that remains presupposed \nin the texts we have just been reading. To give up the idea of a decisive \nand founding event is anything but to ignore the eventness that marks and \nsigns, in my view, what happens, precisely without any foundation or deci-\nsion coming along to make it certain.

So I\u2019ve chosen, in attempting this quasi- concluding \nre\ufb02 ection as a kind of premise for the discussion that will follow, to mark, \nremark, and have you remark with me the fact that at bottom everything \nwe have spoken about came down to problems of translation. Translation \nin a sense at once fundamental and diverse. Translation, \ufb01 rst of all, because \nbetween animal and man \u2014 what is often called by these names, follow-\ning distinctions received in an all- powerful and still living, surviving, tradi-\ntion \u2014 people speak of differences in manifestation, in signi\ufb01 cation, in sig-\nni\ufb01 cance (I\u2019ve often emphasized this, because it holds true from Descartes \nto Lacan, inclusive), and they oppose a logic of programmed reaction in the \nanimal to a logic of free and sovereign responsibility in man. And between \nwhat is interpreted as reaction and what is interpreted as response, respon-\nsibility, or responsible response, what is at stake is, precisely, a translating \ninterpretation \u2014 and every interpretation is a translation. It\u2019s in our way \nof translating what are called animal reactions that we believe ourselves \nable \u2014 but this is a risk of translation \u2014 to discern or trace a limit between \nanimality and humanity, reactive animality and responsive or responsible \nhumanity. It\u2019s a question of translation between languages.\nThere\u2019s another dimension to this problematic of translation, and it con-\ncerns basically all the words we have used, many words, and in particular \nthe fundamental, guiding words, starting with \u201canimal\u201d or \u201cbeast.\u201d I en-\ntitled this seminar The Beast and the Sovereign because, in French, b\u00eate is not \nthe same thing as \u201canimal,\u201d and you will remember the fearsome problems \nof idiom we had to deal with when we had to distinguish b\u00eate from bestialit\u00e9 \nand above all from b\u00ea tise, given that these are not necessarily characteristics \nof the animal. And you remember too that the word b\u00ea tise, the French word \nb\u00ea tise, came up against impassable limits as to its translation, the word- for-\n word translation, the translation of the word, the vocable: there is no word \nin the world that translates the French word b\u00ea tise. This, I think, we have \nshown. This means, among other things, that the way that we French or \nFrancophones live, experience, practice, and put to work the word b\u00eate or \nthe word b\u00ea tise is each time conditioned by contextual systems such that, \neven in French, the word b\u00ea tise is not translatable from French into French: \nI use the word b\u00ea tise in one sense in one context, and in another sense, with \nanother connotation, with another performative effect, in another con-\ntext \u2014 in other words, the word b\u00ea tise is untranslatable from French into \n \n447\n"

It is untranslatable, i.e. it does not have a \ufb01 xed or univocal meaning \nor signi\ufb01 ed that would allow us to say that we are speaking of the same b\u00ea-\ntise here and there, about one person or another, one action or another, one \nlanguage or another. And the fact that the context (what we name with this \nsomewhat facile word \u201ccontext,\u201d i.e. the pragmatic situation) determines in \nsuch a constraining fashion each time the meaning of the word b\u00eate or b\u00ea-\ntise \u2014 this fact means that between the language spoken by those men and \nwomen called French, and animal language, i.e. something commanded by \ncomplicated programs or wiring, there is no easily formalizable difference. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we speak like beasts every time we use the word \nb\u00ea tise, but that the privilege of the idiom \u2014 which can be the privilege of \npoetry, which can be the privilege, of course, as is always the case with the \nidiom, the privilege of the unique event of language that is, for example, \ntermed \u201cpoetic\u201d \u2014 this doesn\u2019t merely mean the poem, it also means a cer-\ntain contamination by what we attribute to so- called reactive or reactional \nanimality.\nSo you see that this question of translation is very broadly overdeter-\nmining for all the problems we are discussing here. These are of course, \nas I just pointed out, problems of translation in discursive language, dis-\ncursive praxis, what we call \u201chuman language,\u201d but already the circum-\nscription of what is called \u201chuman language\u201d becomes problematical for \nthe reasons I have just given. But this is where we are going to encounter \nanother problem of translatio, of translation [de translation, de traduction], \nfolding back on itself or folding and refolding this \ufb01 rst translation: this is \nthat, when we tried to name animality in non- French languages, we en-\ncountered words like bios and zo\u00afe\u00af, two ways of naming life with all the \nproblems you remember, which we tried to deal with last week in reference \nto \u2014 using as our pretext \u2014 Agamben\u2019s text: does the animal come under \nbios or zo\u00afe\u00af? etc. And we naturally bounced back, as to language and as to \nthis distinction between bios and zo\u00afe\u00af, as to the animal or human living be-\ning, onto the fundamental word logos \u2014 man de\ufb01 ned as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, \nthe animal, the living being possessed of logos. What does that mean? It \nhas governed an enormous tradition. The whole tradition we are speak-\ning about has been governed by this de\ufb01 nition, the dif\ufb01 culties of which we \nwere seeing last week, depending on whether one accepts or not Agamben\u2019s \nproposed distinction between \u201cessential attribute\u201d and \u201cspeci\ufb01 c difference,\u201d \na distinction that I found to be fragile. In any case, logos itself, whether \none translates it as language, as is often done, as discourse, or as reason or \nelse as calculation, counting (that the word ratio will translate: reason as \ncounting, as calculus), the word logos itself raised considerable issues when \n448 \n"

We got just a small idea of them, an idea at least, \nby following Heidegger\u2019s interpretation (itself a translating interpretation) \nwhen, even as he himself is protesting, proposing the deconstruction of the \nclassical de\ufb01 nition of man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, as animal rationale, he in-\nvites us to consider the fact that the Greek logos, the legein, which is all at \nonce saying, gathering, assembling, reading too (legere comes from it), had \nbeen diverted from its meaning, which (as Heidegger sees it) is what gath-\ners, maintaining opposites, contraries, by force, and all this in an element \nwhere we are dealing with the physis that can\u2019t even be translated as nature. \nAnother problem of translation: physis is not, for Heidegger, natura; phy-\nsis is everything that grows, phyein, what increases and in what increases, \nin the world or in being as physis, the logos plays, represents, precisely, a \n\u201cforce,\u201d and Heidegger insists on the force (recall words I emphasized last \ntime, such as Herrschaft or Machstellung, which appeal precisely to a deploy-\nment of force), a force of maintaining contraries together \u2014 well, that force, \nthe sense of that originary force of the Greek legein (in Heraclitus, for ex-\nample), has supposedly been diverted or occulted or perverted \u2014 so many \npossible interpretations \u2014 supposedly forgotten, in any case, for example, \nwhen John, John the Evangelist, says that \u201cin the beginning was the lo-\ngos,\u201d identi\ufb01 ed not with the Being of beings, but with a particular entity, i.e. \nChrist, the mediator; when John, in\ufb02 uenced by Philo the Jew, interpreting \nprecisely logos as mediation, as mediator, translates, identi\ufb01 es the logos with \nChrist, and there too Heidegger talks of a Herrschaft, a Machstellung, i.e. an \noperation of sovereignty, of a force that comes to win out over another force. \nSo we are dealing here, as to translative interpretation, with a translation \nthat is not merely a peaceful dictionary- based or interlinguistic operation: \nit is an interpretive translation that brings with it the whole of culture, and \nwhich is not separable from historial movements in which all the forces of \nthe world and the age are engaged. It is not a matter of philologists who de-\ncided all on their own to translate, to interpret logos as Christ, as mediator: it \nis the whole force of history that is at work to produce this translation. And \nobviously, just as this translation occults, or forgets, or deforms, or corrupts, \nor perverts, according to Heidegger, the originary sense of logos, so, in the \ntext by Aristotle that carries such authority, Aristotle\u2019s Politics (I\u2019ll come to \nit in a moment), that de\ufb01 nes man as a zo\u00afon, as a living animal possessed of \nlogos, there too the logos is no longer the originary logos, and this is what \nwill give rise to the entire tradition of rational man, man as rational animal, \ncalculating animal, etc. So you see that what is at stake in translation cannot \nbe limited to the great question that we are dealing with here, \u201cthe beast \n \n449\n \n450\n"
