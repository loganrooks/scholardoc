On the contrary, Merleau-\nPonty, \u201cbetter than others,\u201d would have shown \u201cthat disincarnated\nthought, thinking of speech before speaking it, thought as constitutive\nof the world of speech, was a myth.\u201d But by the force of a movement\nproper to Levinas, he accepts this extreme \u201cmodern\u201d audacity only to\nredirect it toward an in\ufb01nitism that this audacity itself must suppose,\naccording to himself; and the form of this in\ufb01nitism is often quite\nclassical, pre-Kantian rather than Hegelian.

And this demon-\nstration would refer us once more to the Cartesian Cogito of the third\nMeditation, beyond Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and Husserl. And does so\naccording to a schema that seems to us to support the entirety of\nLevinas\u2019s thought: the other is the other only if his alterity is absolutely\nirreducible, that is, in\ufb01nitely irreducible; and the in\ufb01nitely Other can\nonly be In\ufb01nity.\nviolence and metaphysics 129\n"

After\nopposing the magisterial height of the You to the intimate reciprocity of\nthe Me-Thou (TI), Levinas seems to move toward a philosophy of the\nIlle, of the He (Il) in his meditation of the Trace (that is, of the neighbor\nas a distant stranger, according to the original ambiguity of the word\ntranslated as the \u201cneighbor\u201d to be loved).

Here again, Descartes against Husserl, the Descartes of the\nThird Meditation allegedly misconstrued by Husserl. While Descartes, in\nhis re\ufb02ections on the cogito, becomes aware that in\ufb01nity not only cannot\nbe constituted as a (dubitable) object, but has already made in\ufb01nity\npossible as a cogito over\ufb02owing the object, (a nonspatial over\ufb02owing,\nagainst which metaphor shatters), Husserl, on the other hand, \u201csees in\nthe cogito a subjectivity with no support from without, constituting\nthe idea of in\ufb01nity itself, and providing himself with it as object\u201d (TI).\nNow, the in\ufb01nite(-ly other) cannot be an object because it is speech,\nthe origin of meaning and the world. Therefore, no phenomenology\ncan account for ethics, speech, and justice.\nBut if all justice begins with speech, all speech is not just. Rhetoric\nmay amount to the violence of theory, which reduces the other when it\nleads the other, whether through psychology, demagogy, or even peda-\ngogy which is not instruction. The latter descends from the heights of\nthe master, whose absolute exteriority does not impair the disciple\u2019s\nfreedom.

An entire reading and\ninterrogation of Totality and In\ufb01nity could be developed around this\na\ufb03rmation. For this a\ufb03rmation seems to us quite implicitly\u2014perhaps\neven too implicitly\u2014to support the decisive division between what\nLevinas calls the face and that which is Beyond the Face, the section which\nconsiders, aside from the Phenomenology of Eros, Love, Fecundity, and\nwriting and difference\n132\n"

Thus, for example, De l\u2019existence \u00e0 l\u2019existant and Le temps et l\u2019autre seemed\nto proscribe the \u201clogic of genre,\u201d as well as the categories of the Same\nand Other.

Without using these terms\nthemselves, Levinas often warned us against confusing identity and\nipseity, Same and Ego: idem and ipse. This confusion, which, in a certain\nway, is immediately practiced by the Greek concept of autos and the\nGerman concept of selbst, does not occur as spontaneously in French;\nnevertheless, it returns as a kind of silent axiom in Totality and In\ufb01nity41.\nWe have seen this: according to Levinas there would be no interior\ndi\ufb00erence, no fundamental and autochthonous alterity within the ego.\nIf, formerly, interiority, the secret and original separation, had permit-\nted the break with the classical use of the Greek concepts of Same and\nOther, the amalgamation of Same and Ego (Same and Ego homogen-\nized, and homogenized with the concept, as well as with the \ufb01nite\ntotality) now permits Levinas to include within the same condemna-\nwriting and difference\n136\n"

Simultaneously against Hegel and against Kierkegaard.\nLevinas often warns us against confusing\u2014as one is so tempted to\ndo\u2014his anti-Hegelianism with a subjectivism, or with a Kierkegaardian\ntype of existentialism, both of which would remain, according to\nLevinas, violent and premetaphysical egoisms. \u201cIt is not I who do not\naccept the system, as Kierkegaard thought, it is the other.\u201d Can one not\nwager that Kierkegaard would have been deaf to this distinction?

This last\nunity, it seems to us, can be thought only within the horizon of in\ufb01nite\n(inde\ufb01nite) alterity as the irreducibly common horizon of Death and the\nOther. The horizon of \ufb01nitude or the \ufb01nitude of the horizon.\nBut, let us repeat, all this within philosophical discourse, where the thought\nof Death itself (without metaphor) and the thought of a positive In\ufb01nity\nhave never been able to understand each other. If the face is body, it is\nmortal. In\ufb01nite alterity as death cannot be reconciled with in\ufb01nite\nalterity as positivity and presence (God). Metaphysical transcendence\ncannot be at once transcendence toward the other as Death and tran-\nscendence towards the other as God. Unless God means Death, which\nafter all has never been excluded by the entirety of the classical phil-\nosophy within which we understand God both as Life and as the Truth\nof In\ufb01nity, of positive Presence. But what does this exclusion mean if not\nthe exclusion of every particular determination? And that God is nothing\n(determined), is not life, because he is everything? and therefore is at\nonce All and Nothing, Life and Death. Which means that God is or\nappears, is named, within the di\ufb00erence between All and Nothing, Life\nand Death. Within di\ufb00erence, and at bottom as Di\ufb00erence itself. This\ndi\ufb00erence is what is called History. God is inscribed in it.\nIt will be said that Levinas stands opposed to precisely this kind of\nphilosophical discourse. But in this combat, he already has given up the\nbest weapon: disdain of discourse. In e\ufb00ect, when confronted by the\nclassical di\ufb03culties of language we are referring to, Levinas cannot\nprovide himself with the classical resources against them. At arms with\nthe problems which were equally the problems of negative theology\nand of Bergsonism, he does not give himself the right to speak, as they\ndid, in a language resigned to its own failure. Negative theology was\nspoken in a speech that knew itself failed and \ufb01nite, inferior to logos as\nGod\u2019s understanding. Above all, negative theology never undertook a\nDiscourse with God in the face to face, and breath to breath, of two free\nspeeches; and this despite the humility and the haughtiness of breaking\no\ufb00, or undertaking, the exchange. Analogously, Bergson had the right\nto announce the intuition of duration, and to denounce intellectual\nwriting and difference\n144\n"

(cf., for example, Ideas I, paragraph 83, passim). And\nabove all, who better than Levinas \ufb01rst gave us to understand these\nHusserlian themes? Therefore, it is not a question of recalling their\nexistence, but of asking whether Husserl \ufb01nally summarized inadequa-\ntion, and reduced the in\ufb01nite horizons of experience to the condition\nof available objects. And whether he did so by the secondary interpret-\nation of which Levinas accuses him.\nWe can hardly believe so. In the two intentional directions of which\nwe have just spoken, the Idea in the Kantian sense designates the in\ufb01nite\nover\ufb02owing of a horizon which, by reason of an absolute and essential\nnecessity which itself is absolutely principled and irreducible, never can\nbecome an object itself, or be completed, equaled, by the intuition of an\nobject. Even by God\u2019s intuition. The horizon itself cannot become an\nobject because it is the unobjecti\ufb01able wellspring of every object in\ngeneral. This impossibility of adequation is so radical that neither the\noriginality nor the apodicticity of evident truths are necessarily adequa-\ntions. (Cf., for example, Ideas I, sec. 3; Cartesian Meditations, sec. 9, passim.)\n(Of course, this does not imply that certain possibilities of adequate\nevident truths\u2014particular and founded ones\u2014are overlooked by\nHusserl.) The importance of the concept of horizon lies precisely in its\ninability to make any constitutive act into an object, and in that it opens\nthe work of objecti\ufb01cation to in\ufb01nity. In phenomenology there is never\na constitution of horizons, but horizons of constitution. That the in\ufb01n-\nity of the Husserlian horizon has the form of an inde\ufb01nite opening,\nand that it o\ufb00ers itself without any possible end to the negativity of\nconstitution (of the work of objecti\ufb01cation) does this not certainly\nkeep it from all totalization, from the illusion of the immediate pres-\nence of a plenitudinous in\ufb01nity in which the other suddenly becomes\nun\ufb01ndable? If a consciousness of in\ufb01nite inadequation to the in\ufb01nite\n(and even to the \ufb01nite) distinguishes a body of thought careful to\nrespect exteriority, it is di\ufb03cult to see how Levinas can depart from\nwriting and difference\n150\n"

This is his problem: \u201cThey, (the\nother egos) however, are not simple representations or objects repre-\nsented within me, synthetic unities of a process of veri\ufb01cation taking\nplace \u2018within me,\u2019 but precisely \u2018others\u2019 . . . \u2018subjects for this same\nworld . . . subjects who perceive the world . . . and who thereby\nexperience me, just as I experience the world and in it, \u2018others\u2019 \u201d\n(Cartesian Meditations). It is this appearance of the other as that which I\ncan never be, this originary nonphenomenality, which is examined as\nthe ego\u2019s intentional phenomenon.\n(b) For\u2014and here we are keeping to the most manifest and most\nmassively incontestable meaning of the \ufb01fth of the Cartesian Meditations\nwhose course is so mazelike\u2014Husserl\u2019s most central a\ufb03rmation con-\ncerns the irreducibly mediate nature of the intentionality aiming at the\nother as other. It is evident, by an essential, absolute and de\ufb01nitive self-\nevidence that the other as transcendental other (other absolute origin\nand other zero point in the orientation of the world), can never be\ngiven to me in an original way and in person, but only through ana-\nlogical appresentation. The necessary reference to analogical\nappresentation, far from signifying an analogical and assimilatory\nreduction of the other to the same, con\ufb01rms and respects separation,\nthe unsurpassable necessity of (nonobjective) mediation. If I did not\napproach the other by way of analogical appresentation, if I attained to\nthe other immediately and originally, silently, in communion with the\nother\u2019s own experience, the other would cease to be the other.\nContrary to appearances, the theme of appresentative transposition\nwriting and difference\n154\n"

To return, as to the only possible\npoint of departure, to the intentional phenomenon in which the other\nappears as other, and lends itself to language, to every possible language, is\nperhaps to give oneself over to violence, or to make oneself its accom-\nplice at least, and to acquiesce\u2014in the critical sense\u2014to the violence of\nthe fact; but in question, then, is an irreducible zone of factuality, an\noriginal, transcendental violence, previous to every ethical choice, even\nsupposed by ethical nonviolence. Is it meaningful to speak of a pre-\nethical violence? If the transcendental \u201cviolence\u201d to which we allude is\ntied to phenomenality itself, and to the possibility of language, it then\nwould be embedded in the root of meaning and logos, before the latter\nhad to be determined as rhetoric, psychagogy, demagogy, etc.\n(c) Levinas writes: \u201cThe other, as other, is not only an alter ego.

This is exactly what\nHusserl does not do. He seeks to recognize the other as Other only in its\nform as ego, in its form of alterity, which cannot be that of things in\nthe world. If the other were not recognized as a transcendental alter ego,\nit would be entirely in the world and not, as ego, the origin of the\nworld. To refuse to see in it an ego in this sense is, within the ethical\norder, the very gesture of all violence. If the other was not recognized\nas ego, its entire alterity would collapse.

And he called the irreducibly egoic essence of\nexperience \u201carchi-factuality\u201d (Urtatsache), nonempirical factuality, tran-\nscendental factuality (a notion to which attention has never been paid,\nperhaps). \u201cThis I am is for me, for the I who says it and understands it\naccordingly, the primordial intentional foundation of my world (der intentionale\nUrgrund f\u00fcr meine Welt).\u201d48 My world is the opening in which all experience\noccurs, including, as the experience par excellence, that which is tran-\nscendence toward the Other as such. Nothing can appear outside the\nappurtenance to \u201cmy world\u201d for \u201cI am.\u201d \u201cWhether it is suitable or not,\nwhether it appears to me monstrous (due to whatever prejudices) or\nnot, I must stand \ufb01rm before the primordial fact (die Urtatsache, der ich standhalten\nmuss), from which I cannot turn my glance for an instant, as a phil-\nosopher. For philosophical children this indeed may be the dark corner\nto which the ghosts of solipsism, or of psychologism or relativism,\nreturn. The true philosopher will prefer, instead of \ufb02eeing from these\nghosts, to illuminate the dark corner.\u201d49 Understood in this sense, the\nintentional relationship of \u201cego to my world\u201d cannot be opened on the\nbasis of an in\ufb01nite-other radically foreign to \u201cmy world,\u201d nor can it be\nimposed upon me by a God who determines this relationship: \u201cThe\nsubjective a priori is that which precedes the Being of God and of\neverything, without exception, which exists for me, a thinking being.\nGod too, is for me what he is by my own conscious production; I\ncannot look away from this in the anguished fear of what may be\nconsidered blasphemy, but on the contrary must see in it the problem.\nHere too, just as concerning the alter ego, \u2018conscious production\u2019 does\nnot mean that I invent and fashion this supreme transcendence.\u201d50 God\nno more really depends upon me than does the alter-ego. But he has\nmeaning only for an ego in general. Which means that before all atheism\nor all faith, before all theology, before all language about God or with\nGod, God\u2019s divinity (the in\ufb01nite alterity of the in\ufb01nite other, for\nexample) must have a meaning for an ego in general. Let us note in\npassing that the \u201csubjective a priori\u201d recognized by transcendental\nwriting and difference\n164\n"
