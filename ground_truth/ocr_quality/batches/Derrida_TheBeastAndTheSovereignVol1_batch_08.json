Not to pay homage to \nsome obscurantism of nonknowledge, but to prepare perhaps some poetic \nrevolution in the political revolution, and perhaps too some revolution in \nthe knowledge of knowledge, precisely between the beast, the marionette, \nthe head, the Medusa\u2019s head, and the head of His Majesty the sovereign. \nWhich is no doubt signed by the repetition of the \u201cperhaps\u2019s\u201d and the \u201cwho \nknows\u201d (wer weiss).\nWell, to conclude for today, to mark a provisional punctuation or a few \npoints of suspension in our history or in our fable entitled \u201cThe Beast and the \nSovereign,\u201d to make a signal that is still indeterminate, in waiting, in two di-\nrections, both toward the revolution that de- crowns the majesty, and toward \nseveral ages in the history of knowledge, a knowledge of the living animal \nbeing that objecti\ufb01 es or produces objects for the gaze of the sovereign, be \nthat sovereign a great king or be it the people, here then are two signals to \nend today, two signals we shall have to learn to decipher.

In both cases, the one prerevolutionary, the other postrevolutionary, \nwe are dealing with a political organization of the \ufb01 eld of knowledge, in the \nform of the anatomy lesson or the lesson of natural science.\nI take these two signals, these two reference points, from a book and \nespecially an article that I recommend to you.

One of the articles, to which I am now \nreferring, \u201cThe Mental Hospital and the Zoological Garden,\u201d proposes a \nfascinating parallel between these two histories (that of the zoo and that \nof the asylum), especially in France. I shall come back to this next week in \nmore detail. But I wanted today to take from it the two signals or indices \nthat I mentioned above.\nThe \ufb01 rst, the prerevolutionary one, is the one that I placed as an exergue \nat the beginning of this session. It is indeed an anatomy lesson. Following \nvery closely a famous book by Gustave Loisel, Histoire des m\u00e9nageries de \nl\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 \u00e0 nos jours (Paris, 1912, 3 vols.), Ellenberger reconstitutes this dis-\nsection scene and this sort of anatomy lesson objectifying30 the dead body of \na large elephant on the institutional initiative and under the gaze of a great \nsovereign. Here\u2019s the passage from which I took a fragment at the begin-\nning of the session:\nIn his curious work The New Atlantis,31 written between 1614 and 1617, \nFrancis Bacon described an imaginary land where life was dominated by \nthe cult of scienti\ufb01 c research. The parks there contained specimens of all \nthe known animals, which were used in experiments in physiotherapy, in-\ncluding the fabrication of monsters, hybrids, and new species. Here was \nthe foreshadowing of a new trend: the utilization of the zoo for scienti\ufb01 c \nresearch.\n \nIt was in France that this new kind of establishment saw the light of \nday. In 1662 Louis XIV created the Menagerie of Versailles, intended from \nthe outset to be the biggest and most magni\ufb01 cent in the world. Although \nthis was primarily a display establishment reserved for the visits of the king \nand the court in full ceremonial, Louis XIV also made it a research cen-\nter. Upon arrival each animal was painted or represented in miniature by \na known artist. Scienti\ufb01 c exploitation of the menagerie was placed in the \nhands of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, whose members did many animal dis-\nsections and produced the \ufb01 rst important work in comparative anatomy. \nLoisel tells the famous story of the ceremonial dissection of an elephant \nin 1681, an event which the Sun King deigned to honor with his presence: \n\u201cNever perhaps was there a more imposing anatomical dissection, judged \nby the enormity of the animal, by the precision with which its several parts \nwere examined, or by the quality and number of assistants.\u201d But Loisel also \n30. Derrida\u2019s pencil annotation: \u201cObjectifying to death of the object (develop).\u201d\n31.

We have in spite of everything, faced with this scene, this picture im-\nmobilized under the eye of a painter, the striking impression of a hand- to-\n hand combat [un corps \u00e0 corps]. Hand- to- hand between whom and whom, \nwhom and what? First, between two very great bodies, the beast and the \nsovereign, of course. Between two immense living beings \ufb01 rst of all: the \nking of kings, the greatest of kings, Louis le Grand, and the greatest animal. \nNext, this hand- to- hand is a duel, or rather the end, the aftermath, of a duel \n(a warlike duel, perhaps, or unconsciously amorous, therefore narcissistic, \nafter a scene of seduction, hunt, or capture, captation or predation). The \nscienti\ufb01 c scene, the scene of knowledge, takes place in the aftermath, or the \nday after, the defeat of one of the two living beings, on a battle\ufb01 eld but also \n<on> the magnetic \ufb01 eld of a narcissistic attraction that opposed the two \ngreat living beings, the one surviving and the other become cadaveric ob-\n ject at the disposal of the other, at the hand of the other, manipulable by the \nother, captive of the other after having been captured by the great king or \nhis servants, soldiers or merchants, in the course of expeditions.\n2. This scene of knowledge is as phenomenal as the elephant. This is a phe-\nnomenal beast, a phenomenal elephant, i.e. an object that appears, in its \nphainesthai, to the gaze not only of the learned observers but of a Sun King, \na king of light and a source of light, a king who is the condition of pos-\nsibility of appearing and of knowledge, a phenomenological, phenomeno-\n poetical, phenomeno- political king, source and producer of light who, from \nmost high, like Plato\u2019s Good, sun, and agathon, gives being and appearing to \nthings. Here, everything is subject to the Sun King, knowledge, and being, \nand the phenomenal elephant is both subject and object under the king\u2019s \ngaze. The king keeps, owns, has in his possession the immense beast, he \nhas the immense cadaver at his disposal, like an object for his power, for his \nknowledge, for his having and his seeing, and for his pleasure [pour son pou-\nvoir, pour son savoir, pour son avoir et pour son voir, et pour son bon vouloir].\n3. This setup (wanting to have the power to see and to know [vouloir avoir \nle pouvoir de voir et de savoir] \u2014 and you can manipulate this chain in <all> \ndirections), is mediated by institutions.

To whom it remains very docilely subjected. \nAnd the other institution of the same power is the one that was put in place \nfewer than twenty years before the spectacular and theatrical dissection of \nthe elephenomenelephant, namely the Menagerie of Versailles instituted in \n1662. One thinks of this elephenomenelephant that was no longer looking \nat them but that could have seen them, with its own eyes seen the king see \nit in its own autopsy.\n4. Finally, as I suggested with a quotation last week, the structure of this \nsetup of knowing- power, power- to- know, knowing- how- to- see, and sover-\neign being- able- to- see is not, fundamentally, revolutionized by the French \nRevolution. It is not interrupted, and at the death of the king one can still \nsay: \u201cThe King is dead, long live the King!\u201d One has simply changed sov-\nereigns. The sovereignty of the people or of the nation merely inaugurates \na new form of the same fundamental structure. The walls are destroyed, \nbut the architectural model is not deconstructed \u2014 and will, as you will see, \ncontinue to serve as a model and even as an international model. The de-\nstruction of the menagerie of Versailles is only an episode, a simple trans-\nfer of power, since Bernadin de Saint- Pierre, who was the intendant of the \nKing\u2019s Garden, had the debris transported and proposed that a new estab-\nlishment be founded. I recalled last time that a report was then ordered by \nthe Paris Society for Natural History, and written among others \u2014 which \nas we shall see is far from being insigni\ufb01 cant \u2014 by the alienist Pinel. This \nreport, written at the height of the Revolution, in 1792, concluded:\nA menagerie like those that princes and kings are accustomed to maintain \nis nothing but a costly and unnecessary imitation of Asiatic pomp [we shall \nsee shortly, or next time, why \u201cAsiatic\u201d: the point is, then, for the Revolu-\ntion, to put an end to the luxury and idleness of the rich, which does not \nentail putting an end to the popular curiosity of all, but also to bend to \nEuropean and Western rationality a monarchy that was supposedly merely \naping the Asian despots]; but we think that a menagerie without frills [a \ndemocratic and popular menagerie, then, a popular- democratic menagerie, \nsecular and republican, in conformity with the new sovereignty, that of na-\ntion and people] could be extremely useful to natural history, to physiology \nand to the economy.4\n4.

Hidden and visible. \nThere would be no sovereignty without this representation. The illusion or \n\ufb01 ction to which the reading or watching subject is subjected are the very \nexercise and effect of sovereign power to which they are subject as subjects \nof the king. Sovereignty is this narrative \ufb01 ction or this effect of representa-\ntion. Sovereignty draws all its power, all its potency, i.e. its all- powerful \nnature, from this simulacrum- effect, this \ufb01 ction- or representation- effect \nthat is inherent and congenital to it, as it were co- originary. Which means \nthat, and this is a paradox, by giving the reading or watching subject of \nthe narrative representation the illusion of himself pulling sovereignly the \nstrings of history or of the marionette, the mysti\ufb01 cation of representation is \nconstituted by this simulacrum of a true transfer of sovereignty.

One can push a long way the logic of re-\n\ufb02 ection, of the re\ufb02 ective effects of these lights, gazes, and mirrors. There \nis a point where the symmetry is broken and where sovereignty is marked \nby the power to see, by being- able- to- see without being seen, what I called \nelsewhere, in Spectres of Marx on the subject of Hamlet, the visor- effect.24 \nThe king or the king\u2019s specter sees without his gaze, the origin of his seeing, \nwithout his eyes being seen. Here it is the same thing and Marin does not \nfail to recall this \u201casymmetry\u201d:\nOne would be wrong to think that this position puts in return the king into \nthe position of a seen object. In truth it is the opposite. This position is only \nwhat it is by being under the gaze of the king, in the optical cone of his eye. \n[And Marin gives many references to this all- seeing and panoptical eye of \nthe sovereign, in La Bruy\u00e8re, Racine (in a Discourse given, precisely, at the \nAcad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1685, four years after the autopsy of our elephant), \netc.] The gaze of the \u201cI- one\u201d is the plural, inde\ufb01 nite and nonpersonal eye \nin the sovereign gaze, resplendent sun and fulgurant light [soleil \u00e9clatant et \nlumi\u00e8re \u00e9clat\u00e9e] of His Majesty [you see that the word \u00e9clat bespeaks both \nthe brilliance of the beam [\u00e9clat] that strikes and, also, the ubiquitous dis-\npersion which disperses or only disperses the better to invade everything].25 \nAsymmetrical reciprocity of eyes and gaze, of eyes that see what the king \ndoes, says and thinks, and of the gaze that makes them see what he does, \nsays, and thinks: perfect representation without excess or loss in this play \nof re\ufb02 ections or recognition, in spite of the double polarity of the historical \nagent and the narrator, but which operates its effects only at the price of the \nsimulation of this spectacle.26\nMarin certainly talks of autopsy but not about the working of the anatomy \nlesson with the violent opening up of the body of a living- dead, an animal \nor a man, and especially a dead animal. Marin uses the word autopsy in \nwhat is indeed its original sense, the \u201cseeing by oneself,\u201d inspecting with \none\u2019s own eyes. That\u2019s what autopsia originally means: the experience that \nconsists in seeing with one\u2019s own eyes, and thus of being able to bear wit-\nness (and this is the sense to which Marin limits himself when he says that \nPellisson is inspired by the \u201cancient demand of autopsy as guarantee of the \n24.

A meaning that became current and even dominant, like a metonymy or \nan authorized abbreviation, the meaning we are using here to designate \nthe ceremony of dissection, namely the autopsy of a cadaver.

This dead ele-\nphant, put to death or held at bay, because of being dead, by the king, is also \nto some extent, in this necropsy, the denied, averted, vaguely totemic rep-\nresentation of the dead king, the mortal king, the king dead from a death \nof the king that everyone both fears and hopes for, and that every subject \nprojects into the autopsy or the necropsy of sovereignty. A funeral oration \nwhose refrain never ceases: Long live the king, the king is dead long live the \nking the king is dead long live the king the king is dead. A funeral oration \nthat resounds from the century of Louis XIV to the Revolution to B\u00fcchner \nto Lucile and to Lenz.\nRemember that other throne [chaire] from which a Bossuet delivered, ex \ncathedra, his autoptic funeral orations.

In classical absolutism, sug-\ngests Marin, the king\u2019s body is divided or multiplied by three:\n1. The historical and physical body, and thus the mortal body, the one \naround which the king\u2019s doctors (but also subjects and mistresses) busy \nand concern themselves;\n2. The juridical and political body (in sum, I would say, though Marin does \nnot put it like this, the body of the sovereign in the strict state and politi-\ncal sense);\n3. Finally, the semiotic sacramental body, this third body being the one that \nprimarily interests Marin since, through the portrait of the king (that\u2019s \nwhy he calls it semiotic: you know Marin\u2019s \ufb01 ne work on portraits and \nmedals), [through the portrait of the king] the sacramental body is sup-\nposed to ensure the exchange, \u201cwithout remainder,\u201d says Marin, between \nthe three bodies.\nFor my part, I would suggest that this sacred or sacramental body, sworn in \nand legitimated by God himself, by divine sovereignty itself, is indeed the \nplace of exchange, the pact or alliance between the politico- juridical sov-\nereignty of terrestrial all- powerfulness and the celestial sovereignty of the \nall- powerful God. In any case, having put forward the hypothesis of these \nthree bodies, Marin quotes in support of his conjecture the following texts \nby Bossuet and Pascal. As they are very beautiful and say what is essential \nas to the structures and laws that matter to us here, I shall read them: (Read \nand comment)\nIn 1662, in his sermon on the duties of kings, Bossuet exclaims: \u201cTo estab-\nlish this power that represents his power, God places on the forehead of \nsovereigns and on their face a mark of divinity. [. . .] God has made in the \nPrince a mortal image of his immortal authority. You are gods, says David, \nand you are all children of the Most High. But, O gods of \ufb02 esh and blood, \nO gods of earth and dust, you will die like men. No matter, you are gods \neven though you die, and your authority does not die; this spirit of royalty \npasses entire to your successors and imprints everywhere the same fear, the \nsame respect, the same veneration. Man dies, it is true: but the king, we say, \nnever dies: the image of God is immortal.\u201d\n \nA few years earlier, on a little scrap of paper, Pascal had analyzed the \nmechanisms of the representational apparatus, describing the effects pro-\nduced and discerning their reasons in the con\ufb01 gurations they sketch out on \nthe political, juridical and theological planes: \u201cThe custom of seeing kings \n394 \n"

Globalization of the autopsic model, as I call it, \ncharging the attribute \u201cautopsic\u201d with all the features we have emphasized \nuntil now: the objectifying inspection of a knowledge that precisely inspects, \nsees, looks at the aspect of a zo\u00afon the life and force of which have been neu-\ntralized either by death or by captivity, or quite simply by ob- jecti\ufb01 cation \nthat exhibits there before, to hand, before the gaze, and de- vitalizes by \nsimple objecti\ufb01 cation, a learned objecti\ufb01 cation in the academic service of \na learned society, certainly, but a society for which, between the autopsic \nseeing of theoretical knowledge and the autopsic seeing of the theatrical \nspectacle, between the theoretical and the theatrical, between inspection \nand spectacle, the passage and transfer are more than tempting, in truth or-\nganized and institutionalized, whence the two other senses of autopsia: that \nof the necropsic relation to the cadaver and that of participation in divine \npower. I am specifying this point before coming to what in this \u201ctheoretico-\n theatrical,\u201d let\u2019s say inspectacular structure, autopsic and objectifying, de-\nvitalizing, also ensures a certain analogical passage between the modern \nand postrevolutionary zoological garden and psychiatric institutions, insane \nasylums.

A certain Hagenbeck was famous in Germany for furnish-\ning circuses with animals from all around the world (for spectacle and curi-\nosity, for taming and performance: the animals, captured and transported, \nbecame curiosities for the curiosity of the curious who wanted and hence-\nforth were able to see and observe them with their own eyes, autoptically), \nbut for furnishing menageries too. His son, Carl Hagenbeck (1844\u20131913), \nwas a writer, the author of an autobiography entitled Von Tieren und Men-\nschen (1908), and he extended his father\u2019s business, globalized it further in \nthe tracks of colonization, sending expeditions all over the world. Better \nstill, this writer- merchant was also a founder of institutions and of a school. \nWith the help of a Swiss architect and sculptor, Urs Eggenschwyler, he had \nthe huge zoological park in Hamburg constructed, which became famous, \namong other reasons, for the system of limits it innovated \u2014 or with which \nit was surrounded, as one surrounds with care by surrounding with limits. \nIt\u2019s certainly the concept of care, concern, solicitude, cura, that we are talk-\ning about here, and the question of knowing whether it\u2019s possible to sur-\nround with care, as we say, without surrounding with reappropriating lim-\nits. Inventing limits, installing limits, that\u2019s the art we are speaking of here. \nAnd it is an art of both caring and locking up. Between the beast and the \nsovereign, it\u2019s merely a question of limits, and knowing whether a limit is \ndivisible or indivisible. For knowing how to install a limit is both an art and \na technique, perhaps tekhne\u00af itself. Tekhne\u00af is perhaps always an invention \nof limits. Since the point here is always to limit the freedom of movement \nof these living beings, the strategy of the Hamburg zoo consisted in trans-\nforming the visible form and structure, the phenomenon, the phenomenal-\nity of these limits in order to render them all but unnoticeable, thus giving \nthe captive animals the illusion of an autonomy of movement: these new \nlimits, then, are no longer unbreakable metal railings (railings that already \nlimited movement while letting both sides see: so railings were already not \nan absolute and indivisible limit) [these new limits, then, are no longer un-\nbreakable metal railings] but deep ditches that no longer appear as fences, \nditches that disappear as they hollow out, that are formed and appear only \nhollowly [en creux], in sum, and that become negativized, hollowed- out [en \ncreux] limits, in absentia, as it were, even more uncrossable than railings but \nas invisible as an interiorized and freely consented- to limit, as if these poor \ncaptive and dumb animals had given a consent they never in fact gave to \na violence more sure of itself than ever, to what I\u2019ll call repressive violence \nwith a liberal, idealist, and spiritualist grimace.\nThis does not prevent Ellenberger from saying that Hagenbeck was \u201cnot \n \n398\n"

The \ufb01 rst result was an \nimprovement in the biological condition of animals. Many species that had \nnever reproduced in captivity began to do so in modern zoos.\u201d29\nThis question of the reproduction of life will be decisive here, in par-\nticular so as to distinguish, in their very analogy, between zoological gar-\ndens and psychiatric asylums, at least in the dominant interpretation, in \nparticular that of Ellenberger. In the joint, synchronic, and, up to a point, \nparallel improvement of the two institutions, the zoological park and the \npsychiatric hospital, if one allows the beasts to reproduce, one prevents the \nhumans from doing so, at least within the walls of the psychiatric asylums. \nBut let\u2019s wait a little.\nThe culture of curiosity thus organizes the showing of curiosities for cu-\nrious crowds, but the same culture of curiosity also had ambitions to treat, \nto care for, if not to cure.

The \ncura of this curious curiosity always hesitated between two forms or two \naims of what is always a treatment.\nTreat, treatment: I propose to privilege this vocabulary of treatment be-\ncause I \ufb01 nd it quite appropriate here, precisely because it is equivocal, ap-\npropriate because of its equivocality, and this because of a certain essential \nim- propriety, a certain constitutive ambiguity in an experience of treatment, \nor even trade [la traite] (and the white slave trade obeys an analogous logic), \nof treatment, tractation, or trade without contract, which consists, precisely, \nin a strange and equivocal economy, a strange and equivocal ecology that \nconsists in expropriating the other, appropriating the other by depriving \nthe other of what is supposed to be proper to him or her, the other\u2019s proper \nplace, proper habitat, oikos.

There \nwere animals there destined for the royal hunt, for of\ufb01 cial parades, or to \nserve as artists\u2019 models. The Persian paradeisos had a function that Ellen-\nberger calls \u201cmystical\u201d: the king was the incarnation of the supreme god or \nthe master of creation, and so he received the offering or homage of these \nanimals in a garden forbidden to the common mortal. It was less forbidden \nfor the animals to leave than for the men and subjects of the king to enter.\nWell, this paradeisos itself was not original. It dates from the great em-\npires of Babylon and Assyria that themselves followed epochs of tribal po-\nlitical organizations whose potentates already gathered for themselves col-\nlections of wild animals with no obvious purpose, apparently for pure play, \nand sometimes ending by massacring them. We shall talk again about all \nthis, the more so because Ellenberger, with a con\ufb01 dence I don\u2019t share, con-\ncludes his article by asking himself whether, at the end of a transformation, \na happy progress under way \u2014 a progress both of zoological gardens and of \npsychiatric hospitals \u2014 \u201cWill we one day,\u201d he asks, \u201csee the revival of the \nPersian paradeisos, and will that revival produce a new ethical system?\u201d33\nWhat I shall retain for today is, provisionally, this: the garden of Eden, \nthe paradise that the Bible and Dante (and D. H. Lawrence the other day) \ntell us about, was not original, any more than the sin that bears that name. \nI refer you here in conclusion, still provisionally, to the words of Lacan that \nwe quoted a few months ago, in the questioning reading we attempted. We \nhave to read them again and question them again differently. In \u201cSubver-\nsion of the Subject and Dialectic of Desire,\u201d Lacan said this, in which I shall \ncontent myself with emphasizing the word \u201cexperience,\u201d which bears all \nthe weight of the problem, the word \u201cI,\u201d the word \u201cbelieve,\u201d and the vo-\ncabulary of b\u00eatise (the words \u201cimbeciles\u201d and \u201ccretinizing\u201d):\nIs this enjoyment, the lack of which renders the Other inconsistent \u2014 is it \nthen mine? Experience proves that it is ordinarily forbidden to me, and this \nnot only, as the imbeciles [b\u00eates or not?] would believe, through a bad ar-\nrangement of society, but I would say by the fault of the Other if he existed: \nbut as the Other does not exist, all that remains for me is to take the fault on \n\u201cI,\u201d i.e. to believe the thing that experience leads us all to, with Freud in the \nlead: to original sin. For even if we did not have Freud\u2019s admission, as clear \nas it is full of sorrow, the fact would remain that the myth that we owe to \nhim, the newest- born in all history [the Oedipus myth], is of no more use \nthan the myth about the accursed apple, with this slight difference (not a \n33.

Between the zoological and the biological, between these two \nGreek words which are more than words, and are both translated as \u201clife,\u201d \nzo\u00afe\u00af and bios? Isn\u2019t it too late to try, and aren\u2019t all efforts in that direction \ndoomed, essentially, to failure? Especially in French, but also in German \nand En glish and many languages in which there is no distinction between \nthe two words, or even the two concepts, for saying \u201clife\u201d and \u201cliving\u201d? \nAnd isn\u2019t philology too poorly equipped, too unequal to the task, in spite of \nthe grand airs that the lesson givers and the pseudo- experts in this domain \nsometimes take on? Too unequal to the task, philology, not up to this ques-\ntion, which is more than a question as to meaning and word, between zo\u00afe\u00af \nand bios, between zoology and biology, the logic of the logos \ufb01 xing nothing \nand simplifying nothing, as we shall see, for whoever cares to try to un-\ntangle things.
