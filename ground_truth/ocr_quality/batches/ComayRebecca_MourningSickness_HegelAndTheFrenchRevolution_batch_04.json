Both represent a kind of anarchism of \nthe immediate, a disaggregation of the corporeal and cerebral systems into \nvanishing abstraction. Hegel\u2019s later accounts of mental and physical illness \nin the Berlin Encyclopedia clarify the connection. With a terminal disease \nsuch as consumption, the body fixes on an isolated organ: the system fails \nto mobilize to fight the disease because the illness has localized itself with-\nout engaging the circulatory system\u2014curiously, it is the partial or limited \nnature of the disease that poses the mortal danger. And with madness, the \npsyche fixes on an isolated topic: the system fails to mobilize to buffer the \nobsession through symbolic mediations; thinking freezes and the whole \nworld evaporates.74 Both diseases in this sense resemble the hypertrophy of \n\u201ccivil society\u201d at its most pulverized extreme;75 they both indicate a breach \nof totality and a loss of any organizing center. Nature and spirit coalesce at \nthe point of their most extreme abstraction. Out of breath, dispirited, un-\ninspired, Spirit pauses to draw a final breath.\nThe unburied corpse of the beautiful polis will be displayed one last \ntime in its putrid splendor. The vaporized body of the beautiful soul pres-\nents a challenge even beyond that of the rotting corpse of Polyneices: how \nto mourn a missing body, a body that has gone missing even to itself, spir-\nited away, a body whose wounds will disappear without a trace, like Sade\u2019s \nJustine, forever young and beautiful, intact and virginal\u2014a continually \nunwritten surface, unscarred despite an infinity of mutilations?

The beautiful soul\u2019s \nrefusal to act is an act in both senses: the decision is burdened by the con-\ntingency of every action, and moreover cloaks this defect in the garb of \nrighteous indignation.

Behind the manifest appeal to solidarity there wafts an unpleasant \nwhiff of calculation. Was the confession motivated by an expectation of \nexculpation through the other\u2019s counterconfession, a distribution of guilt \nbetween confessant and confessor that might dilute the pungency of the \noriginal confession? I acknowledge my fault before you, but only insofar \nas you let me turn me into your accomplice\u2014tu quoque. I confess, yes, to \nerr is human, as you yourself, you of all people, must surely know. . . Seen \nin this light, the testimony becomes an admission without real liability: I \nam prepared to confess as long as it doesn\u2019t specifically implicate me. The \ntransference thus functions forensically as a translatio crimini\u2014a classic \ndefense strategy (for example, in Cicero), whereby the charge is deflected \nby being \u201ctranslated\u201d to another party, including the accuser himself. The \nwhole scene has been rehearsed in front of a mirror: the confessant has se-\nduced himself into a confession on the basis of an imaginary identifica-\ntion with the confessor, and he wants to lure in the other similarly. \u201cIt is \nenticed into confessing by the vision of itself in the other\u201d (PhG \u00a7669). \nCaptivated by the prospect of easy intimacy, the confessant tries to draw in \nthe other through his own disingenuous display of candor. This is the se-\nductive allure of all confession\u2014its theatricality and chronic tendency to \nhypocrisy: it always risks succumbing to the lure of narcissism.\nThe confessor\u2019s silence raises the suspicion that the confession was \ndriven by the desire for spiritual payback. Every claim to validation risks \nregressing to the vulgar calculus of utilitarianism\u2014mutual exoneration \nthrough shared admission. \u201cOne hand washes the other\u201d (PhG \u00a7560). As \nin love (or maybe this is love), it is the demand for equality that thwarts \nthe possibility of reciprocity. Transference provokes countertransference; the \nconfession can only enrage the listener, who is asked to see his own guilt \nmirrored in the other\u2019s disclosure and is repelled by the thumping cama-\nraderie of the performance. Justified or not (it matters little), the rebuke \ndemystifies the unthinking market assumptions that can always threaten \nto corrupt our notions of reciprocity, even while it confirms the meanness \n(Niedertracht) of the judge who loftily sets himself above (hinaufsetzen) it \nall (PhG \u00a7666). Despite or because of its mean-spiritedness, the judge\u2019s si-\nlence contains a glimmer of critical, even emancipatory, potential.

Confession is staged from \nthe outset as a verbal sacrifice or un-saying (Entsagung) of autonomy\u2014\na renunciation (Abwerfen) that both is and is not to be understood as a \nthrowing away (Wegwerfung) of subjectivity. Confession is an experiment \nwith loss that stops short of flat-out abandon\u2014a simultaneous affirma-\ntion and denial in which we can detect a trace of disavowal in the Freudian \nsense\u2014Verwerfung. The confessant \u201cexpects that the other will contrib-\nute his part\u201d to the transaction, that he will seal the deal by answering \nconfession with confession, and it is this expectation that initially seems \nto dignify the transaction: it protects the confessor from debasement or \ndegradation (Ernie\u00addrigung, Demutigung), at least in his own mind (PhG \n\u00a7\u00a7666\u201367). \u201cHe gives himself utterance solely on account of his having \nseen his identity with the other.\u201d The original intention (Meinung) of the \nconfession was to establish reciprocity with the confessant.

The hard-hearted \njudge hoards his own subjectivity as private property that he is unwilling to \nalienate within the marketplace of communicative exchange. But in this re-\njection of community, the judge inevitably falls into a spiritual abandon in \nwhich he \u201cthrows away\u201d (verwirft) any connection to the other, giving up \nboth liberty and life itself. He shatters in a heap of broken fragments and \n(you can\u2019t die too many times) vanishes in a swoon of delirious tubercular \nconsumption. \u201cIt does in fact surrender the being-for-self to which it so \nstubbornly clings; but what it brings forth is only the non-spiritual unity of \nmere being\u201d (PhG \u00a7668).\nBoth faith and thus Enlightenment itself can now be rescued from \ninsight\u2019s most boneheaded, but also most stupefying, most unanswerable, \n"

Hegel\u2019s expanded confessional culture assumes the infinite \nreversibility of guilt and absolution even while maintaining their asym-\nmetry. The title of this final section, \u201cEvil and its Forgiveness,\u201d contains a \ncrucial ambiguity in that the genitive points in two directions. Evil already \npossesses forgiveness: forgiveness perpetuates evil in the act of absolving \nevil, and it bears the indelible stain of the struggle undertaken to achieve \nthis. Every pardon generates another evil in need of pardon, the complic-\nity is infinite, and suspicion must assume terrorist proportions.

Seen through the rearview mirror of philosophical reflection, the ac-\ncumulated experiences of Spirit will flash by like fleeting snapshots, a series \nof highlights strung together without the connective tissue of narrative di-\nlation.

Strictly speaking, the hard-\nhearted judge has already long gone under, his part played out, his frag-\nments scattered: his muteness has already exiled him to the symbolic death \nof \u201cmadness\u201d and to the biological death of yearning, tubercular \u201ccon-\nsumption\u201d (Schwindsucht)\u2014twice dead but not yet departed. Having been \nsentenced to an early disappearance (Verschwinden), the beautiful soul can \nonly resurface as a spectral apparition, a Hunter Gracchus figure who hav-\ning missed the moment of his own death somehow finds the inspiration, \ndraws the breath, to continue speaking. The whole scene thus transpires in \nthe Lacanian zone between the two deaths, but there is no glamor or con-\nsolation in the rubble\u2014nothing to shield the subject from the horror of \nits own nullity. The beautiful soul is only \u201cso-called beautiful\u201d (eine sogen-\nnante sch\u00f6ne Seele [PhG \u00a7658])\u2014an apparition of an appearance, the bar-\nest simulacrum of a semblance\u2014and aesthetic ideology is exhausted. It is \nnot the living circuit of communication that is reactivated in this fragile \nconspiratio. The subject returns to language only after having broken the \ncommunicative contract. It speaks as a shattered vessel, a \u201cbroken heart\u201d\u2014\nbeauty petrified and smashed in the mirror of its own image (PhG \u00a7669). \nThere is duress here, even a kind of extortion, but of a peculiar kind. It is \nno longer the slavish fear of death that forces my final capitulation to the \nsocial contract. The worst has already occurred. I am already as good as \ndead. I have nothing left to lose.\nDespite or because of what Derrida aptly refers to, if all too hastily \ndismisses, as Hegel\u2019s own \u201crush toward the economy of a reconciliation\u201d10 \n(the rush is undeniable and deserves analysis: it correlates with the delay \nthat precipitated it), Hegel\u2019s account of forgiveness has a bracingly con-\ntemporary edge. Its starting point is the surd of inexpiable finitude that \nboth thwarts and stimulates every movement toward redemption. And \nit is disfigured by a traumatic temporality of delay. The irreversible (un-\nforgivable) lag between confession and forgiveness dramatizes the defer-\nral constitutive of experience. In this catastrophe is the exaggeration that, \nto paraphrase Adorno again, reveals the truth\u2014namely, that experience is \nthe experience of the impossibility of experience. Far from confirming the \nsubject\u2019s immersion in a restricted economy of exchange, forgiveness has \nthe exorbitance of the gift: it arrives unexpectedly, as from the future, and \nis drawn from the depleted reserves of one who has nothing left to give. \n"

Hegel appears here simultaneously at his most audacious and \nmost insufferable: even the irredeemable gets drawn into the circuit of rec-\nonciliation.

Either \nprecritical or apologetic, and in any case, it is often noted, strangely undia-\nlectical: was not Hegel himself the first to insist that he liked his stockings \nmended but his consciousness torn?11\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek argues that such protests sentimentalize and \u201ccom-\npletely miss the point\u201d (as he is fond of saying) of speculative negation: as \nHegel reminds us, \u201cconsciousness suffers violence at its own hands\u201d (PhG \n\u00a780). Subjectivity is itself the trauma, the injury is self-inflicted. Rather \nthan wishing away the injury or demonizing its malignancy, the point is \nto confront the infinity of the infirmity. The only way to close the wound, \nor rather to undo its coercive power, is to reopen it: to become what we \nare. Absolute knowing is just the subject\u2019s identification with the wound-\nedness that it is. Antidote is in this sense indistinguishable from injury, \nhealth from illness, and poison from cure; Hegel is here rehearsing all the \nparadoxes of the pharmakon. \u201cSalvation is an act of purely formal conver-\nsion,\u201d writes \u017di\u017eek, \u201ca shift of perspective\u201d whereby we suddenly perceive \nour desire to be always already satisfied and the Messiah to have always \nalready arrived.12 (This is not that there is anything to be satisfied about, \nbut rather because our only satisfaction lies in dissatisfaction. What we de-\nsire more than anything is to keep on desiring: at least it makes us feel as \nif we were still alive.) If we don\u2019t get too sidetracked by the potential her-\noism and even Stoicism of this way of thinking (a whiff of \u201closer wins\u201d), \n\u017di\u017eek\u2019s reading is suggestive. It engages the repetitive, restless energy of \nthe dialectic, its obsessive, circular doing and undoing: every inscription \nsupplies its own erasure, every erasure its own reinscription, and this in-\ntransitive, tautological transition from negation to negation is relentless. \nIt exposes desire to the compulsive, machinelike energy of the drive. The \n\u201csilent, ceaseless weaving of Spirit\u201d is Penelopean: the work is infinite and \nthe shroud forever unfinished.

To say \u201cyes,\u201d as Derrida has noted, is to prolong the conversation \nby forcing an incessant repetition of the beginning; my response prompts \nyou to rephrase the question to which I will answer yes (and yes again).

All \naccumulated values have been suspended and there is no symbolic capital \non which to draw. Forgiveness evacuates the substantial plenitude of every \ncommunity, both past and future. The opening to the universal is thus nei-\nther reconstructive (forgiveness does not presuppose the stable identity of \nthe social context) nor constructive (it does not stipulate a social norm). It is \neven unclear by this point either what is being affirmed or who is talking or \nlistening: both speaker and auditor are produced by the speech act, and have \nno existence beyond this.

It is also peculiarly nonidiomatic. \nStrangely nominalized and floating in italics, the word is reduced to a zero \ndegree of meaning and expressivity: spectral, citational, referentially opaque. \nSpeech is hovering on the verge of empty reverberation.\nAlthough it would be outlandish to try to translate this into an in-\nstitutional program, forgiveness demands an immersion in social matters. \n"

In the end the judge testifies to his own failure to testify \nand language speaks from and of a core of silence.\nDespite its traditional appearance, and despite or because of the abrupt-\nness of its elaboration, Hegel\u2019s notion of forgiveness is, when scratched (and \ninsofar as comparisons add up to an argument), as hyperbolic as anything \nin\u00a0Derrida, as asymmetrical as anything in Levinas, as disastrous as any-\nthing\u00a0in Blanchot, as paradoxical as anything in Kierkegaard.

How did the scaffold of a state not yet under \nconstruction become in advance a ruin? The prefaces to the Phenomenol-\nogy and to the Philosophy of Right present two sides of one dilemma. The \ngray on gray is the palimpsest of a present that must be read as an anach-\nronism\u2014both a stony tablet on which to write the epitaph for a state not \nyet in existence and a blank canvas on which to trace the vestige of an op-\nportunity already past. The indiscernible gap between gray and gray marks \nthe minimal interval in which the spectator can find a foothold for in-\ntervention. Repetition marks the formal difference separating the present \nfrom itself; it identifies the site where the subject\u2019s agency is both reflected \nand repelled. Hegel is starting to rehearse the antinomies of the modern-\nist avant-garde. If the monochrome hints of the absoluteness of the tabula \nrasa\u2014a utopian movement of transcendence, \u00e0 la Malevich, at once an \nerasure of the past and the preparation of a new beginning\u2014it is haunted \nalso, Richter-like, by the deadly specter of tautology: the entropy, bore-\ndom, and flatness of serial, industrial reproduction, the repetition that an-\nnounces the paralyzing anachronism of the present day.35 In 1820, Hegel is \nbeginning to explore the spectral logic that Marx will soon enough make \nunforgettable: shadows without bodies, phrases without content, history \nwithout events: \u201cif any episode in history has been colored grey on grey, \nthis is the one. Men and events appear as Schlemihls in reverse, as shadows \nthat have lost their bodies.\u201d36 In the Eighteenth Brumaire, the dappling of \ngray on gray announces an impossible mourning for a revolution that did \nnot occur as such; the repetition speaks of the slide from original to copy, \nfrom uncle to nephew, from tragedy to farce. The \u201cmonochromatic for-\nmalism\u201d pilloried by Hegel in the preface to the Phenomenology will haunt \nhis later project like the night in which all cows (or cats, as the saying origi-\nnally went) are gray (cf. PhG \u00a716). The gray suggests the utopian blankness \nof forgiveness, but hints also of something darker; it points to an oblitera-\ntion of missed opportunities and an effacement of unappeasable demands. \nThe Philosophy of Right is in this respect as so many others an endless ne-\ngotiation with the censors.\nSetting aside the quaint details of what exactly Hegel claims to find \nin the newborn state, whose decrepitude he is so emphatically underscor-\ning, we can pause to consider the strange temporality at work.

(After May 1968, under the influence of Lacan, the \nfigure of the belle \u00e2me would be imported into France, where it would \nfind its place in fretful discussions of yet another abortive revolution.)43 \nHow to preserve a space of critical negativity without relinquishing the \nclaim to practical engagement; how to engage without simply reproduc-\ning the conditions of the day; how to distinguish aesthetic dissonance, de-\ntachment, or disenchantment from disenfranchisement, abdication, and \nself-\u00addeception; how to distinguish commitment from an unthinking sub-\nmission to the existent; how to steer a path between the bankruptcy of \n\u201cforced reconciliation\u201d and the false comforts of the \u201cGrand Hotel Abyss\u201d? \nThe last formulation suggests that the choice might be an empty one: just \nas the activist embrace of immediacy can be a manic defense against the \ntraumatic pressure of the missed opportunity, so too misery provides its \nown pacifications.\nBy the end of Hegel\u2019s life, this melancholy keeps threatening to over-\nwhelm the historical understanding, and Hegel never ceases to denounce \nit\u2014the easy slippage from lamentation (Klage) to accusation (Anklage) \nto delirious resignation (with a whiff of schadenfreude) before the gor-\ngeous ruination of the past. Hegel describes the rancor of the historical \nspectator as a depression, a hypochondria, and ultimately as a hypocrisy \n(PhR \u00a7149). In the Philosophy of History, he will reactivate the theologi-\ncal vocabulary of the Phenomenology: historicist melancholia is the \u201cre-\nbellion [Emp\u00f6rung] of the good Spirit\u201d44\u2014the stiff-necked judgment that \nonly confirms history\u2019s most tenacious grip.

In the exquisite formalism of this gesture the essential logic of \nthe Terror is both interrupted and prolonged.\nHegel does not, then, or does not only reproduce the standard Ger-\nman response to the French Revolution: the well-traveled route from polit-\nical revolution to moral regeneration and finally to aesthetic upheaval\u2014the \n\u201crevolution in poetic language\u201d that marks the seemingly one-way street \nfrom modernity to aesthetic modernism. Not simply an observer, but not \nquite a fellow traveler, Hegel maps the itinerary from the uneasy distance \nof a survivor. This is less in order to simply repudiate the trajectory than \nto denaturalize it or make it strange\u2014a kind of thought experiment that, \npushed to its extreme, will destroy itself, together with every fantasy of im-\nmaculate perception. The moral view of the world will be the final phan-\ntasm Spirit must suffer and eventually relinquish.\nIf morality presents itself as the narrative successor to the Revolu-\ntion, it is not because it either logically fulfils or historically supersedes it. \nKant\u2019s critical venture phenomenologically succeeds the Revolution (which \nit chronologically, of course, anticipates) insofar as his text becomes legible \nonly retroactively as a result of the event which it supposedly inspires. Ben-\njamin\u2019s well-known remark on the belated legibility of texts is relevant. Ca-\ntastrophe inflicts a posthumous shock upon the past in the light of which \nevery artifact can be inflected as a document of horror: the past suddenly \nreveals itself to be a bursting archive of missed opportunities, aborted ini-\ntiatives, and unrealized potentials. In this case it is critique itself, Kantian-\nstyle criticism, that undergoes its belated crisis. The Revolution inflicts on \nKant\u2019s text a retroactive trauma.\nSuch a shock exposes the anachronism of the present\u2014Hegel\u2019s im-\nmediate intellectual context, on which the chapter on \u201cmorality\u201d provides \na running commentary and critique. The literary allusions come fast and \nfurious throughout the final section, and are frequently elusive, produc-\ning a collage of not always coherent or even identifiable citations; Hegel is \naiming at a moving target. The quotations are unlike the obvious quota-\ntions from Sophocles in the Sittlichkeit section (the author was in no need \nof naming: the reference was as transparent as the ethical tautology it illus-\ntrated), just as they differ from the garbled lines from Diderot that Hegel \n"
