For the German is no \nlonger the subject of such mobilization, and the danger thereby grows that \nhe will be conceived as its object.\" Even now you rightly regard total \nmobilization as a distinctive [12 1) characteristic of what is actual. Yet its \nactuality is for you now no longer determined by the \"will to (my emphasis) \ntotal mobilization\" (Der Arbeiter, p. 148), and is no longer determined in \nsuch a way that this will can have validity as the sole source that \"gives \nmeaning\" and justifies everything. Hence you write ( Ober die Linie, p. 30): \n\"There is no doubt that our subsistence (i.e., according to p. 3 1, 'persons, \nworks, and institutions') as a whole is moving across the critical line. The \ndangers and our security are thereby altered.\" In the zone belonging to \nthe line, nihilism approaches its conswnmation. The whole of \"human \nsubsistence\" can cross the line only if this subsistence steps out of the zone \nof consummate nihilism. \nAccordingly, a discussion of the line must ask: Wherein consists the \nconsummation of nihilism? The answer seems to be at hand. Nihilism \nis consummated when it has seized all subsisting resources and appears \nwherever nothing can assert itself as an exception anymore, insofar as such \nnihilism has become our normal condition. Yet in this condition of normal\u00ad\nity the consummation only becomes actualized. The condition of normality \nis a consequence of the conswnmation. Consummation [ Vol/endung) means \nthe gathering of all essential possibilities of nihilism, possibilities that re\u00ad\nmain difficult to see through as a whole and individually. The essential \npossibilities of nihilism can be pondered only if we think back toward its \nessence. I say \"back\" because the essence of nihilism prevails ahead and \nthus in advance of individual nihilistic phenomena, gathering them into its \nconsummation. Yet the consummation of nihilism is not already its end. \n'\\ 3th the consummation of nihilism there first begins the final phase of ni\u00ad\n. h1hsm. The zone of this end-phase, because it is pervaded by a condition \nof normality that sets in, is presumably unusually broad. For this reason \nthe zero-line, where the consummation becomes an end, is not yet visible \nat all in the end. \nYet how do matters stand, then, concerning the prospect of crossing over \nthe line? Is human subsistence already in a transition [zzz] trans lineam, \nor is it now first entering the broad field that stands before the line? But \nrerha4s our eyes deceive us here in an unavoidable way. Perhaps the zero\u00ad\nme wlll emerge suddenly before us in the form of a planetary catastrophe. \n197 \n"

You too think the relation of Gertalt to that which it \"forms\" \nas a relation of stamping and shaping. However, you understand shaping \nin a modem sense as a conferring of\"meaning\" or \"sense\" upon that which \nis meaning- or sense-less. The Gestalt is the \"source that gives meaning\" \n(Der Arbeiter, p. 148). \nThis historical pointer to the way in which Gertalt, i8t11, and being belong \ntogether is not meant to discount your work by historiographical means, \nbut to indicate that it remains housed within metaphysics. In accordance with \nmetaphysics, all beings, changeable and moved, mobile and mobilized, are \nrepresented from the perspective of a \"being that is at rest,\" and this even \nwhere, as in Hegel and Nietzsche, \"being\" (the actuality of the actual) is \nthought as pure becoming and absolute movement. The Gestalt is \"meta\u00ad\nphysical power\" (Der Arbeiter, pp. 1 1 3, 1 24 146). \n[224) ln another respect, however, the metaphysical representation that \noccurs in The Worker is distinct from Platonic and even from modem rep\u00ad\nresentation, that of Nietzsche excepted. The source that gives meaning, \nthe power that is present in advance and thus shapes everything, is Gertalt \nas the Gestalt of a particular kind of human: \"The Gertalt of the worker.\" \nThe Gerta/t resides in the essential configuration of a kind of human that, \nas subiectum, underlies all beings. It is not the individual human being as an \n\"I,\" the subjective aspect of being an ego, but the preformed and Gertalt-like \npresence of a particular cast (type) of human that constitutes the most ex\u00ad\ntreme subjectity, which comes to the fore in the consummation of modem \nmetaphysics and is presented through its thinking. \nIn the Gestalt of the worker and its domination it is no longer the sub\u00ad\njective, let alone the subjectivistic, subjectity of the human essence that is \nseen. The metaphysical seeing of the Gestalt of the worker corresponds to \nthe projection of the essential Gertalt of Zarathustra within the metaphysics \nof the will to power. \\Vhat is concealed in this appearing of the objective \nsuhjectity of the mbiectum (of the being of beings), which is meant as a \n(it'Stalt of human being and not as an individual human being? \nTalk of the subjectity (not subjectivity) of the human essence as the \nfoundation for the objectivity of every subiectum (everything present) ap\u00ad\npears in every respect to be paradoxical and contrived.

Yet we do not even need \nto think back to Kant's transcendental deduction of the categories to see \nthat catching sight of the Gestalt as the source that gives meaning is a matter \nof the legitimation of the being of beings. It would be an all too crude ex\u00ad\nplanation were one to say that [225] here in a secularized world the hwnan \nheing takes the place of God as originator of the being of beings. Certainly, \nthere can be no doubt that the hwnan essence plays a role. But the essence \n( Wesen in the verbal sense)4 of the hwnan being, \"the Dasein in the human \nbeing\" (cf. Kant and the Probln of Metaphysics, first edition [1929], \u00a743), is \nnothing human. For the idea of the human essence to be able to attain the \nstatus of that which, as ground, already underlies everything present as that \npresence that first permits a \"representation\" among beings and thus \"legit\u00ad\nimizes\" the latter as beings, the human being must first of all be represented \nin the sense of an authoritative, underlying ground. Yet authoritative for \nwhat? For securing beings in their being. \"What meaning does \"being\" \nassume when the securing of beings is at stake? It appears as that which can \nbe ascertained, i.e., represented, anywhere and at any time. Understanding \nbeing in this way, Descartes found the subjectity of the subiet:tum in the \nego cogito of the finite human being. The appearance of the metaphysical \nGestalt of the human being as the source that gives meaning is the ultimate \nconsequence of positing the human essence as the authoritative subiectum. \nAs a consequence, the inner form of metaphysics, which resides in what \none can call transcendence, becomes transformed. Within metaphysics, \ntranscendence is for essential reasons ambiguous. \"Where such ambiguity is \nnot heeded, a hopeless confusion spreads, a confusion that may serve as the \ncharacteristic sign of the metaphysical representation that is still customary \ntoday. \nOn the one hand, transcendence refers to the relation proceeding from \nbeings and passing over to being, and which transpires between the two. \nAt the same time, however, transcendence refers to the relation leading \nfrom changeable beings to an entity that is at rest. Finally, corresponding \nto the use of the title \"Excellence,\" transcendence can refer to that supreme \nentity itself, which is then also called \"being,\" resulting in it being strangely \nconfused with the first meaning. \n\\Vhy bore you with this hint concerning these distinctions, which are \nbandied about all too readily today, i.e., are scarcely [226) thought through \nin their diversity or in their belonging together?

Nor can we ponder it so long \nas we fail to ask: What is \"it\" that does the \"giving\" here? In what kind \nof giving does it give? To what extent does there belong to this \"giving of \nbeing and nothing\" something that gives and entrusts itself to this gift in \npreserving it? We can easily say: There is a giving [es gibt]. Being no more \n\"is\" than nothing. But there is a giving of both. \nLeonardo da Vinci writes: \"The nothing has no middle, and its limits are \nthe nothing.\" \"Among the great things that are to be found among us, the \nbeing of nothing is the greatest\" (Tagebikher und Aufteichnungen, translated \nfrom the Italian manuscripts and edited by Theodor Liicke [1940], pp. 4f.). \nThis word from one of the greats cannot, and is not meant to, prove any\u00ad\nthing; but it points to the questions: In what way is being, is nothing, given? \nFrom whence does such giving come to us? To what extent are we already \ngiven over to it, insofar as we are human beings? \nBecause the lecture \"What Is Metaphysics?\", in keeping with the occa\u00ad\nsion at hand, inquires in a deliberately restricted manner from the perspec\u00ad\ntive of the surpassing, i.e., of the being of beings, and does so with regard to \nthat nothing which initially presents itself to the scientific representation \nof beings, people have seized upon and extracted \"the\" nothing and made \nthe lecture into a testament to nihilism. Now that a considerable time has \npassed, it might be permitted to ask the question: Where, in which sen\u00ad\ntence and in which tum of phrase, is it ever said that the nothing named in \nthe lecture is a nothing in the sense of a negative nothing and as such the \nfirst and last goal of all representation and existing? \n[z48) The lecture closes with the question: \"Why are there beings at \nall, and why not far rather Nothing [Nichts]?\" Here, contrary to custom, \nthe word Nichts, \"Nothing,\" is deliberately capitalized. In tenns of the \nwording, the question brought up here is indeed that posed by Leibniz \nand taken up by Schelling. Both thinkers understand it as the question \nconcerning the supreme ground and primary existing cause of all beings. \nThe contemporary attempts to restore metaphysics are fond of addressing \nthe said question. \nYet the lecture \"What Is Metaphysics?\", in accordance with its differ\u00ad\nently construed path through another realm, also thinks this question in a \ntransformed manner.

They already stand, without their knowing it, in a relation to \nbeing. Only from the truth of being that prevails on each occasion do they \nreceive a light that first enables them to see and observe as such the beings \nrepresented by them. Asking \"What is metaphysics?\", i.e., the thinking that \nemerges from metaphysics, is no longer science. But the surpassing as such, \n[249] i.e., the being of beings with regard to its essence, becomes worthy \nof question for thinking, and thus never worthy of nothing or nihilistic. \nHere, the apparendy empty word \"being\" is always thought in the essential \nfullness of those determinations that, from \u0158\u2022)me; and Aoyoc; to the \"will \nto power,\" refer to one another and everywhere show a fundamental trait \nthat we attempt to name in the word \"presencing\" [An-wesen] (Being and \nTime, \u00a76). Only because the question \"What is metaphysics?\" from the start \nrecalls the surpassing, the transcendens, the being of beings, can it think the \n\"not\" of beings, that nothing which is equioriginarily the Same as being. \nOf course, those who have never seriously pondered the context and \nfundamental orientation of the question concerning metaphysics, the point \nof departure of its path, the occasion of its unfolding, and the sphere of the \nsciences it addresses itself to, must come to the conclusion that here a phi\u00ad\nlosophy of nothing (in the sense of a negative nihilism) is being proclaimed. \nThe misinterpretations of the question \"What is metaphysics?\" - mis\u00ad\ninterpretations that apparendy cannot yet be eradicated - and the failure \nto recognize its vantage point, are least of all mere consequences of an \naversion to thinking. Their origin lies more deeply concealed.

We can answer this question by taking a his\u00ad\ntoriographical look at Hegel's philosophy from a present-day standpoint, \nand in so doing investigate the relation in which Hegel for his part repre\u00ad\nsents Greek philosophy historiographically.

But why, then, this roundabout \napproach through Hegel and the Greeks in order to arrive at the matter of \nthinking? Because we need to take this path, which indeed, in its essence, \nis not a roundabout one; for the tradition, experienced in the right way, \nprovides us the present that stands over against us as the matter of thinking \nand, for that reason, is at issue. Genuine tradition is so far from being \nthe dragging weight of what is past that it much rather frees us for what \napproaches us as present, and thus becomes the enduring directive toward \nthe matter of thinking. \nHegel and the Greeks - this sounds like: Kant and the Greeks, Leibniz \nand the Greeks, medieval Scholasticism and the Greeks. It sounds like \nthis, and yet is nonetheless different. For it is Hegel who, for the first \ntime, thinks the philosophy of the Greeks as a whole and thinks this whole \nphilosophically. In what way is this possible? By virtue of the fact that Hegel \ndetermines history as such in such a way that it must be philosophical in its \nfundamental trait. The history of philosophy is for Hegel the intrinsically \nunitary and hence necessary process of the advance of spirit toward itself. \nThe history of philosophy is no mere sequence of diverse opinions and \nteachings that supersede each other without any connection. \nHegel says in an introduction to his Berlin lectures on the history of \nphilosophy: \"The history which we have before us is the history of thought \nfinding itself\" ( Vorlesungen Uber die Geschicbte der Pbirosopbie, ed. Hoffmeister \n1940, vol. I, p. 81, note). \"For only philosophy itself unfolds the histocy \nof philosophy\" (ibid., pp. 235f.). Accordingly, for Hegel, philosophy as \nthe self-unfolding of spirit toward absolute knowing and the history of \nphilosophy are identical. No philosopher before Hegel gained such a fun\u00ad\ndamental philosophical position (257] as to make possible and require that \nphilosophizing itself move at the same time within its history and that this \nmovement be philosophy itself. But according to a statement of Hegel's \nfrom the introduction to his first lecture here in Heidelberg, philosophy \nhas for its \"goal\": \"truth\" (ibid., p. 14). \nAs Hegel says in a marginal note to the manuscript of this lecture, phi\u00ad\nlosophy is as its history the \"realm of pure truth, - not the deeds of erter7141 \nreality, but rather the inner remaining-with-itself of spirit\" (ibid., p. 6, note). \n\"Truth\" means here: what is true in its pure realization, which at the same \ntime brings to presentation the truth of what is true, truth in its essence. \nMay we now take Hegel's determination of the goal of philosophy, which \nis truth, as hinting at a meditation upon the matter of thinking?

However, for thinking there is never anything \nfamiliar. Hegel explains: \"With him (namely, with Descartes), we properly \nenter upon a self-supporting philosophy. Here, we can say that we are home \nand, like the sailor who has journeyed on the stormy sea for a long time, cry: \n'Land-ho!' \" (Werke, vol. XV, p. 328). With this image Hegel means to \nsuggest the following: The \"ego cogittt sum, \" the \"I think, I am,\" is the solid \nground upon which philosophy can settle truly and completely. In the phi\u00ad\nlosophy of Descartes, the ego becomes the authoritative subiectum, i.e., that \nwhich already lies before. However, this subject [258] is first taken hold of \nin the right way - namely, in the Kantian sense, transcendentally and com\u00ad\npletely, i.e., in the sense of speculative idealism - when the whole structure \nand movement of the subjectivity of the subject unfolds and is taken up into \nabsolute self-knowing. In lmtYWing itself as this lmowing that conditions all \nobjectivity, the subject is, as this lmowing, the absolute itself. True being is \nthe thinking that thinks itself absolutely. For Hegel, being and thinking are \nthe same, specifically in the sense that everything is taken back into thinking \nand is determined according to what Hegel simply calls \"thought.\" \nSubjectivity, as the ego cogito, is consciousness that represents something, \ndraws what is represented back to itself and in this way gathers it to itself. \nIn Greek, gathering is called /,.fy\u00a3Lv. To gather what is manifold for the I \ninto the I is called, expressed in the middle voice, My\u00a3o6cl. The thinking \nI gathers what is represented in going through that which is represented, \nin going through it in its representability. \"Going through something\" in \nGreek is called lha. \u0515LaAty\u00a3o6ciL, dialectic, signifies here that the subject \nbrings its subjectivity before it, produces it in and as the said process. \nDialectic is the process of the production of the subjectivity of the ab\u00ad\nsolute subject and, as such, its \"necessary activity.\" In accordance with the \nstructure of subjectivity, the production process involves three stages. First \nof all, the subject as consciousness relates itself immediately to its object. \nThis immediately and yet indeterminately represented object Hegel also \ncalls \"being,\" the universal, the abstract. For in this connection abstraction \nis still made from the relation of the object to the subject. Only through \nthis relating back, or reflection, does the object come to be represented as \nobject for the subject, and the subject come to be represented for itself, i.e., \n325 \n"

However, so long as we merely differentiate \nobject and subject, being and reflection, over against each other, and persist \nwith this differentiation, the movement from the object to the subject does \nnot yet set forth the whole of [259] subjectivity for subjectivity. The ob\u00ad\nject, being, is indeed mediated with the subject through reflection, but the \nmediation itself, as the innermost movement of the subject, is not yet repre\u00ad\nsented for the subject. Only when the thesis of the object and the antithesis \nof the subject are detected in their necessary synthesis is the movement of \nthe subjectivity of the subject-object relation complete in its course. This \ncourse is a proceeding from the thesis, advancing to the antithesis, going \nover into the synthesis, and, from out of this synthesis as the whole, the \nreturn to itself of the positing posited. This course gathers the whole of \nsubjectivity into the unfolded unity of subjectivity. In this way, subjectivity \ngrows together, con-crescit, becomes concrete. Dialectic is speculative in \nthis manner. For specu/ari means detecting, catching sight of, apprehend\u00ad\ning, com-prehending. Hegel says in the Introduction to the Science of Logie \n(ed. Lasson, vol. I, p. 38) that speculation consists \"in the apprehending \nof opposites in their unity.\" Hegel's way of characterizing speculation be\u00ad\ncomes clearer if we notice that, in speculation, what is at stake is not only \nthe apprehending of unity, the phase of synthesis, but in the first instance \nand always the apprehending \"of opposites\" as opposites. This requires \napprehending the shining of opposites against one another and in one an\u00ad\nother, which is the manner in which antithesis reigns as it is presented in the \n\"Logic of Essence\" (i.e., the logic of reflection). From this self-re-flecting \nshining, or mirroring, speculari (speculum: mirror) receives its conclusive de\u00ad\ntermination. Considered in this way, speculation is the positive whole of \nthat which \"dialectic\" is meant to signify here: not a transcendental, criti\u00ad\ncally restrictive, or even polemical way of thinking, but rather the mirroring \nand uniting of opposites as the process of the production of spirit itself. \nHegel also calls \"speculative dialectic\" simply \"method.\" By this title he \nmeans neither an instrument of representing nor merely a special way of \nproceeding in [260] philosophy. \"Method\" is the innermost movement of \nsubjectivity, \"the soul of being,\" the production process through which the \nweb of the whole actuality of the absolute is woven. \"Method,\" \"the soul of \nbeing\" - that sounds like fantasy. It is commonly thought that our age has \nleft behind such errors of speculation. Yet we are living right in the midst \nof this supposed fantasy. \nWhen modem physics aims at a formula for the world, then it becomes \napparent that the being of beings has dissolved itself in the method of total \ncalculability.

That is strange, but all the stranger since Hegel closes the Foreword \nto his interpretation of Heraclitus with the words: \"there is no sentence \nof Heraclitus that is not taken up in my logic\" (ibid., p. 328). But for \nthis \"logic\" of Hegel, A6yo<; is reason in the sense of absolute subjectivity, \nthe \"logic\" itself is speculative dialectic, through whose movement what is \nimmediately universal and abstract, being, is reflected as what is objective \nin opposition to the subject, and this reflection is determined as mediation \nin the sense of becoming. In becoming, what is opposed comes together, \nbecomes concrete and in this way comes to unity. To apprehend this unity \nis the essence of that speculation which unfolds itself as dialectic. \nIn Hegel's judgment, Heraclitus is the first to recognize dialectic as a \nprinciple, and thereby to advance further beyond Parmenides. Hegel ex\u00ad\nplains: \"Being (as Parmenides thinks it) is the One, the first; the second \nis becoming - he (Heraclitus) has advanced to this determination. That \nis what is first of all concrete, the absolute, as in it the unity of opposites. \nThus, with him (Heraclitus), the philosophical idea in its speculative form is \nfirst to be found\" (ibid.). In this way, then, Hegel places the main emphasis \nof his interpretation of Heraclitus on the sentences in which the dialectical, \nthe unity and uniting of contradictions, comes to language. \n[265] The basic word of Plato reads: 'IMa. For Hegel's explication of \nPlatonic philosophy, it remains to be considered that he apprehends the \nIdeas as \"the intrinsically determinate universal.\" \"Intrinsically determi\u00ad\nnate\" means: the Ideas are thought in their state of belonging together; \nthey are not mere prototypes existing in themselves, but are rather \"what is \nin and for itself\" as distinct from \"the sensibly existing\" (Werke, vol. XI\\T, \np. 199). \"In and for itself\" - therein lies a coming-to-be-itself, namely, \ncon-ceiving oneself. Accordingly, Hegel can explain: the Ideas are \"not \nimmediately in consciousness (namely, as intuitions), rather they are (me\u00ad\ndiated in consciousness) in cognition.\" \"For this reason, one does not h11Vt \nthem, but rather they are brought forth within spirit through cognition\" \n(ibid., p. 201). This bringing-forth, producing, is conceiving as the activity \nof absolute knowing, i.e., \"science.\" Therefore Hegel says: \"With Plato be\u00ad\ngins philosophical science as science\" (ibid., p. 169). \"What is distinctive of \nPlatonic philosophy is its orientation toward the intellectual, supersensible \nworld . . .  \" (ibid., p. 1 70). \nThe basic word of Aristotle reads: ' Ev\u00a3pye:Oa, which Hegel translates as \n\"actuality\" (the Roman actus).

Hegel makes clear his assessment \nof the whole of Aristotelian philosophy in the following sentence: \"If one \nwere to take philosophy seriously, then nothing would be worthier than to \nhold lectures on Aristotle\" (ibid., p. 3 14). \nAccording to Hegel, philosophy becomes \"serious\" when it no longer \nloses itself in objects and in subjective reflection upon objects, but rather \nbecomes active as the activity of absolute knowing. \nClarifying the four basic words allows us to recognize that Hegel un\u00ad\nderstands \nY Ev, A6yoc;, ' I8E11, and 'Evtpye:Lil within the horizon of being, \nwhich he conceives as the abstract universal. Being, and accordingly that \nwhich is represented in the basic words, is not yet detennined and not yet \nmediated in and through the dialectical movement of absolute subjectivity. \nThe philosophy of the Greeks is the stage of this \"not yet.\" It is not yet \nthe completion, but for all that it is nonetheless understood from the per\u00ad\nspective of this completion, which has determined itself as the system of \nspeculative idealism. \nAccording to Hegel, it is the innermost \"drive,\" \"the need\" of spirit to \ndetach itself from what is abstract by absolving itself into the concreteness \nof absolute subjectivity and so freeing itself for itself. Hence, Hegel can say: \n\"philosophy is what is most opposed to the abstract; it is precisely the strug\u00ad\ngle against what is abstract, the constant war with the understanding's reflec\u00ad\ntion\" (Hoffmeister, vol. I, p. I I 3). In the Greek world, spirit indeed comes \nfor the first time into free and open opposition to being. But spirit does \nnot yt:t properly come to absolute certainty of itself as self-knowing sub\u00ad\nject. Only where this latter occurs, in the system of speculative-dialectical \nmetaphysics, docs philosophy come to be what it is: \"what is holiest, what \nis innermost to spirit itseJr' (ibid., p.

To this day there has been no experience of history that, \nseen philosophically, could respond to this experience of history.

We shall listen to Kant. \n\\Vhy do we listen to Kant to learn something about being? For two \nreasons. First, Kant took a far-reaching step in the discussion of being. \nSecond, Kant took this step out of loyalty to the tradition, i.e., in a criti\u00ad\ncal encounter with it, which threw new light on it. Both reasons for the \nreference to Kant's thesis about being impel us to reflect. \nKant's thesis about being goes as follows, according to the version in his \nmain work, the Critique of Pure Reason (1781): \n\"Being\" is obviously not a real predicate; that is, it is not a concept of something \nwhich could be added to the concept of a thing. It is merely the positing of a thing, \nor of certain determinations in and of themselves. (A 598, B 616) \nIn view of that which today is, which in being besets us and which as \npossible nonbeing threatens us, Kant's thesis about being strikes us as ab\u00ad\nstract, meager, and pale. For, meanwhile, it has also been demanded of \nphilosophy that it no longer be satisfied with interpreting the world and \nroving about in abstract speculations, but rather that what really matters \nis changing the world practically. But changing the world in the manner \nintended requires beforehand that thinking be changed, just as a change \nof thinking already underlies the demand we have mentioned. (Cf. [175] \nKarl Marx, The German ldeolog;y: \"A. Theses on Feuerbach ad F euerbach, 1 1 \": \n\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point \nis to change it.\") \nBut in what way is thinking supposed to change if it does not take the path \ninto that which is worthy of thought? Now, the fact that being presents itself \nas that which is worthy of thought is neither an optional presupposition nor \nan arbitrary invention. It is the verdict of a tradition that still governs us \ntoday, and this far more decisively than one might care to admit. \nKant's thesis offends us as abstract and inadequate only if we fail to \nconsider what Kant said in elucidation of it and how he said it. We must \nfollow the path of his elucidation of the thesis. We must bring before our \neyes the region in which that path runs. We must bear in mind the site \nwhere what Kant discusses and situates under the name \"being\" belongs. a \n\u2022 Fir.t edition, 19li3: Topology of being. \n"

Positio, \nponrl\"e, means to set, place, lay, lie, to lie before, to lie at the gro\u049e_nd. \nIn the course of the history of onto theological inquiry the task has arisen \nnot only of showing what the highest being is but of proving that this most \nsupreme of beings is, that God exists. The words Existenz, Dasein, actuality, \nname a mode of being. \nIn the year 1 763, almost two decades before the appearance of the \nCritique of Pure Reason, Kant published a work under the title The Only \nPossible Ground of Proof for a Dmumstration of the Existence of God. The \"First \nConsideration\" in this work deals with the concepts of \"Existence [Dasein] \nin general\" and \"being in general.\" Here we already find Kant's thesis about \nbeing, and even in the twofold form of the negative and the affirmative as\u00ad\nsertion. The wording of both assertions agrees in a certain manner with \nthat in the Critique of Pure Reason. The negative assertion goes like this in \nthe precritical work: \"Existence is not a predicate or determination of any\u00ad\nthing whatever.\" The affirmative assertion goes: \"The concept of positing \nor asserting [Position oder Setzung] is completely simple and identical with \nthat of being in general.\" \nAt first it was necessary only to point out that Kant formulates the thesis \nwithin the province of the questions of philosophical theology. This dom\u00ad\ninates the entire question about the being of beings, i.e., metaphysics in its \ncentral content. From this it can be seen that the thesis about being is no \nout-of-the-way, abstract bit of doctrine, as its wording might at first easily \npersuade us. \nIn the Critique of Pure Reason the negative-defensive assertion is intro\u00ad\nduced with an \"obviously.\" That means it is supposed to be immediately \nevident to everyone: being - [279] \"obviously\" not a real predicate. For us \ntoday the statement is by no means immediately clear. Being - this means, \nof course, reality. How, then, could being not count as a real predicate? \nBut for Kant the word \"real\" still has its original meaning. It means that \nwhich belongs to a res, to a substance, to the substantive content of a thing. \nA real predicate, a determination belonging to a substance, is, for example, \nthe predicate \"heavy\" with respect to the stone, regardless of whether the \nstone really exists or not. In Kant's thesis \"real\" means, then, not that which \nwe mean today when we speak of Realpolitik, which deals with facts, with \nthe actual. Reality is for Kant not actuality but rather substantiality. A real \npredicate is such as belongs to the substantive content of a thing and can \nhe attributed to it. We represent and place before ourselves the substantive \ncontent of a thing in its concept. We can place before ourselves what the \nword \"stone\" names without its being necessary that the thing in question \n341 \n"

Being is nothing real. \nBut how is that? After all, we do say of a stone lying before us that it, this \nstone here, exists. This stone is. Accordingly, the \"is,\" i.e., being, shows \nitself just as obviously as predicate, namely, in the assertion about this stone \nas the subject of the assertion.

Obviously \nof the existing stone. And what does this \"is\" in the assertion \"The stone \nis here\" say? It says nothing about what the stone, as stone, is; it does \nsay, however, that what belongs to the stone exists here, is\u095d 'what is called \nbeing, then? Kant answers with the affirmative assertion in his thesis: Being \n\"is merely the positing of a thing or of certain determinations in and of \nthemselves.\" \n[z8o] The wording of this statement easily misleads one into supposing \nthat being as \"merely the positing of a thing\" concerns the thing in the \nsense of the thing in and for itself. This meaning the thesis cannot have, \ninsofar as it is expressed within the Critique of Pure Reason. \"Thing\" here \nmeans something for which Kant also says \"object\" or \"Gegmstand. \" Nor \ndoes Kant say that the positing concerns the thing with all its real deter\u00ad\nminations; what he says is rather, \"merely the positing of the thing, or of \ncertain determinations in and of themselves.\" How the phrase \"or of certain \ndeterminations\" is to be interpreted we shall leave open for now. \nThe expression \"in and of itselr' does not mean: \"something_m its_elf.\" \nsomething that exists unrelated to a consciousness. The \"in and of itself\" \nwe must understand as marking the distinction from what is represented \nas this or that with regard to something else.

The \n\"merely,\" however, indicates that being can never be explained by what any \ngiven being is, i.e., for Kant, by the concept. The \"merely\" does not limit, \nbut rather assigns being to a domain where alone it can be characterized in \nits purity. \"Merely\" means here: purely. \"Being\" and \"is\" belong, with all \ntheir meanings and inflections, in a domain of their own. They are nothing \nthing-like, i.e., for Kant, nothing objective. \nIn order to think of\"being\" and \"is,\" therefore, another view is required, \none that is not guided exclusively by observing things and by reckoning with \n342 \n"

[z8r] Does not this interpretation of being as positing re\u00ad\nmain for us strange, even arbitrary, or in any case ambiguous and therefore \ninexact? \nKant himself, to be sure, translates \"positing,\" \"Position, \" by Setzung. \nBut this does not help much. For our German word Setzung is just as \nambiguous as the Latin positio. The latter can mean: (1) Setting, placing, \nlaying as action. (z) Something set, the theme. (3) Setness [GesetztheitJ, \nsite, constitution. But we can also understand Position and Setzung in such \na way that they mean the unity of the positing of something posited as such \nin its positedness. \nIn every case the characterization of being as positing points to an am\u00ad\nbiguity that is not accidental and also not unknown to us. For it plays about \neverywhere in the realm of that setting and placing that we know as repre\u00ad\nsenting. For this, the learned language of philosophy has two characteristic \nnames: representing is percipere, perceptio, to take something to oneself, \ngrasp; and: repraesentare, to hold opposite oneself, to hold present to one\u00ad\nself. In representing we place something before ourselves, so that it, as \nthus placed (posited), stands over against us as object. Being, as position, \nmeans the positedness of something in representational positing. Accord\u00ad\ning to what is posited and how it is posited, positing, position, being has a \ndifferent meaning. Kant, therefore, after setting up his thesis about being \nin the text of the Critique of Pure Reason, continues: \nIn its logical use it [i.e., being as \"merely the position\") is merely the copula of a \njudgment. The proposition \"God is omnipotent\" contains two concepts, each of \nwhich has its object - God and omnipotence. The small word \"is\" adds no new \npredicate, but only serves to posit the predicate in its n:lation to the subject. \nIn The Only Possible Ground of Prof the relationship between the subject \nand predicate of the sentence as posited by the \"is\" of the copula is called the \nre.fpectus logicus. Kant's talk of the \"logical use\" of\"being\" causes one to sup\u00ad\npose that there is yet another use [z8z ] of\"being.\" At the same time we are \nat this point already learning something essential about being. It is \"used,\" \nin the sense of applied. This use is accomplished by the understanding, by \nthinking. \n\\\\!hat other use of \"being\" and of the \"is\" is there, besides the \"logical\" \none?
