In existing, Dasein understands itself, and in such a \nway, indeed, that this understandin gdoes not merely get something in its \ngrasp, but makes up the existentiell Being of its factical potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing. The Being which is disclosed is that of an entity for which this \nBeing is an issue. The meaning of this Being-that is, of care-is what \nmakes care possible in its Constitution; and it is what makes up prim\u00ad\nordially the Being of this potentiality-for-Being. The meaning of Dasein's \nBeing is not something free-floating which is other than and 'outside of' \nitself, but is the self-understanding Dasein itself. What makes possible \nthe Being of Dasein, and therewith its factical existence? \nThat which was projected in the primordial existential projection of \nexistence has revealed itself as anticipatory resoluteness. What makes this \nauthentic Being-a-whole of Dasein possible with regard to the unity of \nits articulated structural whole ?2 Anticipatory resoluteness, when taken \nformally and existentially, without our constantly designating its full \nstructural content, is Being towards one's ownmost, distinctive potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being. This sort of thing is possible only in that Dasein can, \nindeed, come towards itself in its ownmost possibility, and that it can put \nup with this possibility as a possibility in thus letting itself come towards \nitself-in other words, that it exists. This letting-itself-come-towards-itself \nin that distinctive possibility which it puts up with, is the primordial \nphenomenon of the future as coming towards. 3 If either authentic or \n1 'Die Frage nach dem Sinn des Seins eines Seienden macht das Woraufhin des allem \nSein von Seiendem zugrundeliegenden Seinsverstehens zum Thema.'

By the term 'futural', we do not here \nhave in view a \"now\" which has not yet become 'actual' and which some\u00ad\ntime will be for the first time. We have in view the coming [Kunft] in \nwhich Dasein, in its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, comes towards itself. \nAnticipation makes Dasein authentically futural, and in such a way that the \nanticipation itself is possible only in so far as Dasein, as being, is always \ncoming towards itself-that is to say, in so far as it is futural in its Being \nin general. \nAnticipatory resoluteness understands Dasein in its own essential \nBeing-guilty. This understanding means that in existing one takes over \nBeing-guilty; it means being the thrown basis of nullity. But taking \nover thrownness signifies being Dasein authentically as it already was. 1 \nTaking over thrownness, however, is possible only in such a way that the \nfutural Dasein can be its ownmost 'as-it-already-was'-that is to say, its \n326 \n'been' [sein \"Gewesen\"]. Only in so far as Dasein is as an \"l-am-as-having\u00ad\nbeen\", can Dasein come towards itself futurally in such a way that it \ncomes back. 2 As authentically futural, Dasein is authentically as \"having \nbeen\". 3 Anticipation of one's uttermost and ownmost possibility is coming \nback understandingly to one's ownmost \"been\". Only so far as it is futural \ncan Dasein be authentically as having been. The character of \"having \nbeen\" arises, in a certain way, from the future. 4 \nAnticipatory resoluteness discloses the current Situation of the \"there\" \nin such a way that existence, in taking action, is circumspectively con\u00ad\ncerned with what is factically ready-to-hand environmentally.

(The use of 'zukommen' with \nthe preposition 'auf' is to be distinguished from a use of this same verb with the dative \nwhich we have met in earlier chapters in the sense of 'belongs to . .  .', 'is becoming \nto \u2022\n.\n .', or 'has coming to \u2022\n\u2022\n .'.) \n1 'Dbernahme der Geworfenheit aber bedeutet, das Dasein in dem, wie es je schon war, \neigentlich sein.' \nll 'N ur sofern Dasein iiberhaupt ist als ich bin-gewesen, kann es zukiinftig auf sich selbst \n10 zukommen, dass es zurick-kommt.' Many German verbs form their perfect tense with \nthe help of the auxiliary 'sein' ('to be') in place of the somewhat more usual 'haben' \n('have'), just as we sometimes say in English 'he is gone' instead of 'he has gone'. \nAmong such verbs is 'sein' itself. This 'I have been' is expressed by 'ich bin gewesen'; this \nmight be translated as 'I am been', but in this context we have ventured to translate it as \n'I am as having been'. \n8 'Eigentlich zukiinftig ist das Dasein eigentlich gewesen.' \n\u009b 'Die Gewesenheit entspringt in gewisser Weise der Zukunft.' Here 'The character of \nhaving been' represents 'Die Gewesenheit' (literally, 'beenhood'). Heidegger distinguishes \nthis sharply from 'die Vergangenheit' ('pastness') .  We shall frequently translate 'Gewesen\u00ad\nheit' simply as 'having been'. \n"

Only \nas the Present [Gegenwart]l in the sense of making present, can resoluteness \nbe what it is: namely, letting itself be encountered undisguisedly by that \nwhich it seizes upon in taking action. \nComing back to itself futurally, resoluteness brings itself into the \nSituation by making present. The character of \"having been\" arises from \nthe future, and in such a way that the future which \"has been\" (or better, \nwhich \"is in the process of having been\") releases from itself the Present.2 \nThis phenomenon has the unity of a future which makes present in \nthe process of having been; we designate it as \"temporality\".3 Only in so \nfar as Dasein has the definite character of temporality, is the authentic \npotentiality-for-Being-a-whole of anticipatory resoluteness, as we have \ndescribed it, made possible for Dasein itself. Temporality reveals itself as the \nmeaning of authentic care. \nThe phenomenal content of this meaning, drawn from the state of \nBeing of anticipatory resoluteness, fills in the signification of the term \n\"temporality\". In our terminological use ofthis expression, we must hold \nourselves aloof from all those significations of'future', 'past', and 'Present' \nwhich thrust themselves upon us from the ordinary conception of time. \nThis holds also for conceptions of a 'time' which is 'subjective' or 'Objec\u00ad\ntive', 'immanent' or 'transcendent'. Inasmuch as Dasein understands \nitself in a way which, proximally and for the most part, is inauthentic, we \nmay suppose that 'time' as ordinarily understood does indeed represent \na genuine phenomenon, but one which is derivative [ein abkiinftiges]. It \narises from inauthentic temporality, which has a source of its own. The \nconceptions of 'future', 'past' and 'Present' have first arisen in terms of \nthe inauthentic way of understanding time. In terminologically delimiting \n327 \nthe primordial and authentic phenomena which correspond to these, we \nhave to struggle against the same difficulty which keeps all ontological \nterminology in its grip. When violences are done in this field of investiga\u00ad\ntion, they are not arbitrary but have a necessity grounded in the \nfacts.

Temporality temporalizes, \nand indeed it temporalizes possible ways of itself. These make possible the \nmultiplicity ofDasein's modes of Being, and especially the basic possibility \nof auth\u01a1ntic or inauthentic existence. \nThe future, the character of having been, and the Present, show \nthe phenomenal characteristics of the 'towards-oneself', the 'back-\nto', and the 'letting-oneself-be-encountered-by' .1 The phenomena of the \n329 \n\"towards . . .  \", the \"to . . .  \", and the \"alongside . . .  \", make temporality \nmanifest as the \u00a3KO'TanK6v pure and simple.

But this very \nlevelling off, in accordance with its existential meaning, is grounded in \nthe possibility of a definite kind of temporalizing, in conformity with \nwhich temporality temporalizes as inauthentic the kind of 'time' we have \njust mentioned. If, therefore, we demonstrate that the 'time' which is \naccessible to Dasein's common sense is not primordial, but arises rather \nfrom authentic temporality, then, in accordance with the principle, \"a \npotiori fit denominatio\", we are justified in designating as \"primordial time\" \nthe temporaliry which we have now laid bare. \n1 'Zukunft, Gewesenheit, Gegenwart zeigen die phiinomenalen Charaktere des \"Auf\u00ad\nsich-zu\", des \"Zuriick auf\", des \"Begegnenlassens von\".'

Briefly the correlation seems to be as follows: \nzu: \n,(ukunft; \nauf sich zukommen; Auf-sich-zu; \nSich-vorweg. \nauf: \nGewesenheit; zuriickkommen auf; Zuriick auf; \nSchon-sein-in. \nbei: \nGegenwart; \nBegegnenlassen von ; Sein-bei. \nThe root-meaning of the word 'ecstasis' (Greek EKC1Taucs; German, 'Ekstase') is \n'standing outside'.

Primordial and \nauthentic temporality temporalizes itself in terms of the authentic \nfuture and in such a way that in having been futurally, it first of \nall awakens the Present.1 The primary phenomenon of primordial and authentic \ntemporality is the future. The priority of the future will vary according to the \nways in which the temporalizing of inauthentic temporality itself is \nmodified, but it will still come to the fore even in the derivative kind of \n'time'.11 \nCare is Being-towards-death.

Primordial and authentic coming\u00ad\ntowards-oneself is the meaning of existing in one's ownmost nullity. In \nour thesis that temporality is primordially finite, we are not disputing \nthat 'time goes on'; we are simply holding fast to the phenomenal char\u00ad\nacter of primordial temporality-a character which shows itself in what \nis projected in Dasein's primordial existential projecting. \nThe temptation to overlook the finitude of the primordial and authentic \nfuture and therefore the finitude of temporality, or alternatively, to hold \n'a priori' that such finitude is impossible, arises from the way in which the \nordinary understanding of time is constantly thrusting itself to the fore. \nIf the ordinary understanding is right in knowing a time which is endless, \nand in knowing only this, it has not yet been demonstrated that it also \nunderstands this time and its 'infinity'.

What is the signification of 'in \ntime' in general, and of the expressions 'in the future' and 'out of the \nfuture' in particular? In what sense is 'time' endless? Such points need to \nbe cleared up, if the ordinary objections to the finitude of primordial time \nare not to remain groundless. But we can clear them up effectively only \nif we have obtained an appropriate way of formulating the question as \nregards finitude and in-finitude. 2 Such a formulation, however, arises only \nif we view the primordial phenomenon of time understandingly. The \nproblem is not one of how3 the 'derived' [\"abgeleitete\"] infinite time, 'in \nwhich, the ready-to-hand arises and passes away, becomes primordial finite \n331 \ntemporality; the problem is rather that of how inauthentic temporality \narises out of finite authentic temporality, and how inauthentic temporality, \nas inauthentic, temporalizes an in-finite time out of the finite.

However, it not only gives us the right kind of insurance against the \nparalogisms and against ontologically inappropriate questions about the \nBeing of the \"I\" in general, but it provides at the same time, in accor\u00ad\ndance with its central function, a more primordial insight into the \ntemporali(.ation-structure of temporality, which reveals itself as the histori\u00ad\ncality of Dasein. The proposition, \"Dasein is historical\", is confirmed as a \nfundamental existential ontological assertion. This assertion is far removed \nfrom the mere ontical establishment of the fact that Dasein occurs in a \n'world-history'. But the historicality of Dasein is the basis for a possible \nkind of historiological understanding which in turn carries with it the \npossibility of getting a special grasp of the development of historiology \nas a science. \nBy Interpreting everydayness and historicality temporally we shall get \na steady enough view of primordial time to expose it as the condition \n333 \nwhich makes the everyday experience of time both possible and necessary. \nAs an entity for which its Being is an issue, Dasein utili(.es itself primarily \nfor itself [ verwendet sich \u2022\n.\n.\n for sich selbst], whether it does so explicitly or \nnot.

'Verwenden' means \nliterally to 'turn something away', but is often used in the sense of 'turning something to \naccount', 'utilizing it' ; in a reflexive construction such as we have here, it often takes on \nthe more special meaning of 'applying oneself' on someone's behalf. (In previous passages \nwe have generally translated 'verwenden' as 'use'.) 'Verbrauchen' means to 'consume' \nor 'use up'. 'Brauchen' too means to 'use'; but it also means to 'need', and it is hard to tell \nwhich of these senses Heidegger here has in mind. \n"

If it is to be possible for something 'to be \nin question' [das \"In-Frage-stehen\"], a disclosedness is needed.

In \neach case Dasein is understandingly in the way that it can be.1 Resolute\u00ad\nness has turned out to be a kind of existing which is primordial and \nauthentic. Proximally and for the most part, to be sure, Dasein remains \nirresolute ; that is to say, it remains closed off in its ownmost potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being, to which it brings itself only when it has been individualized. \nThis implies that temporality does not temporalize itself constantly out \nof the authentic future. This inconstancy, however, does not mean that \ntemporality sometimes lacks a future, but rather that the temporalizing \nof the future takes various forms. \nTo designate the authentic future terminologically we have reserved \nthe expression \"anticipation\". This indicates that Dasein, existing authentic\u00ad\nally, lets itself come towards itself as its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-\n337 \nthat the future itself must first win itself, not from a Present, but from the \ninauthentic future. If we are to provide a formally undifferentiated term \nfor the future, we may use the one with which we have designated the first \nstructural item of care-the \"ahead-of-itself\". Factically, \nDasein \nis \nconstantly ahead of itself, but inconstantly anticipatory with regard to its \nexistentiell possibility. \nHow is the inauthentic future to be contrasted with this ? Just as the \nauthentic future is revealed in resoluteness, the inauthentic future, as an \necstatical mode, can reveal itself only ifwe go back ontologically from the \ninauthentic understanding of everyday concern to its existential-temporal \nmeaning. As care, Dasein is essentially ahead of itself. Proximaly and for \nthe most part, concernful Being-in-the-world understands itself in terms \nof that with which it is concerned. Inauthentic understanding2 projects \nitself upon that with which one can concern oneself, or upon what is \nfeasible, urgent, or indispensable in our everyday business. But that with \nwhich we concern ourselves is as it is for the sake of that potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing which cares. This potentiality lets Dasein come towards itself in its \nconcernful Being-alongside that with which it is concerned. Dasein does \nnot come towards itself primarily in its ownmost non-relational potential\u00ad\nity-for-Being, but it awaits this concernfully in terms of that which yields or \ndenies the object of its concern. 3 Dasein comes towards itself from that with \nwhich it concerns itself. The inauthentic future has the character of \nawaiting. 4 One's concernful understanding of oneself as they-self in terms \n1 'Verstehend ist das Dasein je, wie ea sein kan.' \n2 'Das uneigentliche Verstehen \u2022\n\u2022\n .'

In each case some sort of awaiting must have disclosed the \nhorizon and the range from which something can be expected. Expecting \nis founded upon awaiting, and is a mode of that future which temporali\u0318es itself \nauthenticalry as anticipation. Hence there lies in anticipation a more pri\u00ad\nmordial Being-towards-death than in the concernful expecting of it. \nUnderstanding, as existing in the potentiality-for-Being, however it \nmay have been projected, is primariry futural. But it would not temporalize \nitself if it were not temporal-that is, determined with equal primordiality \nby having been and by the Present. The way in which the latter ecstasis \nhelps constitute inauthentic understanding, has already been made plain \nin a rough and ready fashion. Everyday concern understands itself in \nterms of that potentiality-for-Being which confronts it as coming from its \npossible success or failure with regard to whatever its object of concern may \nbe. Corresponding to the inauthentic future (awaiting), there is a special \nway of Being-alongside the things with which one concerns oneself. This \nway of Being-alongside is the Present-the \"waiting-towards\" ;1 this \n338 \necstatical mode reveals itself if we adduce for comparison this very same \necstasis, but in the mode of authentic temporality. To the anticipation \nwhich goes with resoluteness, there belongs a Present in accordance with \nwhich a resolution discloses the Situation. In resoluteness, the Present is \nnot only brought back from distraction with the objects of one's closest \nconcern, but it gets held in the future and in having been. That Present \nwhich is held in authentic temporality and which thus is authentic itself, we \ncall the \"moment of vision\". 2 This term must be understood in the active \nsense as an ecstasis. It means the resolute rapture with which Dasein is \ncarried away to whatever possibilities and circumstances are encountered \nin the Situation as possible objects of concern, but a rapture which is held \nin resoluteness. 3 The moment of vision is a phenomenon which in principle \n1 'Gegen-wart'. In this context it seems well to translate this expresion by a hendiady$ \nwhich, like Heidegger's hyphenation, calls attention to the root-meaning of the noun \n'Gegenwart'. See our notes 2, p. 47, (H. 25) and 2, p. 48 (H. 26) above. \n2 Cf. note 2, p. 376, H. 328 above. \na 'Er meint die entschlossene, aber in der Erschlossenheit gehaltene Entriickung des \nDaseins an das, was in der Situation an besorgbaren Moglichkeiten, Umstiinden begegnet.' \nThe verb 'entricken' means literally 'to move away' or 'to carry away', but it has also \ntaken on the meaning of the 'rapture' in which one is 'carried away' in a more figurative \nsense. While the words 'Entriickung' and 'Ekstase' can thus be used in many contexts as \nsynonyms, for Heidegger the former seems the more general. (See H. 365 below.) We \nshall translate 'entriicken' by 'rapture' or 'carry away', or, as in this case, by a combina\u00ad\ntion of these expressions. \n"

And indeed this can be established in an \nontico-psychological maner. Our task, however, is to exhibit the onto\u00ad\nlogical structure of having-a-mood in its existential-temporal Constitution. \nAnd of course this is proximally just a matter of first making the tempora\u00ad\nlity of moods visible.

Our temporal Interpretation will restrict itself to the \nphenomena of fear and anxiety, which we have already analysed in a \npreparatory manner. \nWe shall begin our analysis by exhibiting the temporality ofjear.v Fear \nhas been characterized as an inauthentic state-of-mind. To what extent \ndoes the existential meaning which makes such a state-of-mind possible \nlie in what has been? Which mode of this ecstasis designates the specific \ntemporality offear ? Fear is a fearing in the face tifsomething threatening\u00ad\nof something which is detrimental to Dasein's factical potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing, and which brings itself close in the way we have described, within \nthe range of the ready-to-hand and the present-at-hand with which we \nconcern ourselves. Fearing discloses something threatening, and it does \nso by way of everyday circumspection. A subject which merely beholds \nwould never be able to discover anything of the sort. But if something is \ndisclosed when one fears in the face of it, is not this disclosure a letting\u00ad\nsomething-come-towards-oneself [ ein Auf-sich-zukommenlassen] ? Has \nnot \"fear\" been rightly defined as \"the expectation of some oncoming \nevil\" [eines ankommenden Ubels] (\"malumfuturum\") ? Is not the primary \nmeaning of fear the future, and least of al, one's having been ? Not only \ndoes fearing 'relate' itself to 'something future' in the signification of \nsomething which first comes on 'in time' ; but this self-relating is itself \nfutural in the primordially temporal sense. All this is incontestable. \nManifestly an awaiting is one of the things that belong to the existential\u00ad\ntemporal Constitution of fear. But proximaly this just means that the \ntemporality of fear is one that is inauthentic. Is fearing in the face of some\u00ad\nthing merely an expecting of something threatening which is coming on ? \nSuch an expectation need not be fear already, and it is so far from being \nfear that the specific character which fear as a mood possesses is \nmissing. This character lies in the fact that in fear the awaiting lets what is \nthreatening come back [zuruckkommen] \nto \none's factically concernful \npotentiality-for-Being. Only if that to which this comes back is already \necstatically open, can that which threatens be awaited right hack to the \nentity which I myself am; only so can my Dasein be threatened.1 The \nawaiting which fears is one which is afraid 'for itself' ; that is to \nsay, fearing in the face of something, is in each case a fearing about; \n1 \u2022 Zuriick auf das Seiende, das ich bin, kann das Bedrohliche nur gewartigt, und so das \nDasein bedroht werden, wenn das Worauf des Zuriick auf . . .  schon iiberhaupt ekstatisch \noffen ist.' \n"

When one's Being\u00ad\nin-the-world has been threatened and it concerns itself with the ready-to\u00ad\nhand, it does so as a factical potentiality-for-Being of its own. In the face \nof this potentiality one backs away in bewilderment, and this kind of \nforgetting oneself is what constitutes the existential-temporal meaning of \n342 \nfear.1 Aristotle rightly defines \"fear\" as AV1T7J -rLs- P -rapax\u01a2-as \"a kind \nof depression or bewilderment\". vi This depression forces Dasein back to \nits thrownness, but in such a way that this thrownness gets quite closed off. \nThe bewilderment is based upon a forgetting. When one forgets and backs \naway in the face of a factical potentiality-for-Being which is resolute, one \nclings to those possibilities of self-preservation and evasion which one has \nalready discovered circumspectively beforehand. When concern is afraid, \nit leaps from next to next, because it forgets itself and therefore does not \ntake hold of any definite possibility. Every 'possible' possibility offers itself, \nand this means that the impossible ones do so too. The man who fears, \ndoes not stop with any of these; his 'environment' does not disappear, but \nit is encountered without his knowing his way about in it any longer. 2 \nThis bewildered making-present of the first thing that comes into one's head, \nis something that belongs with forgetting oneself in fear. It is well known, \nfor instance, that the inhabitants of a burning house will often 'save' the \nmost indifferent things that are most closely ready-to-hand. When one has \nforgotten oneself and makes present a jumble of hovering possibilities, one \nthus makes possible that bewilderment which goes to make up the mood\u00ad\ncharacter of fear. 3 The having forgotten which goes with such bewilder\u00ad\nment modifies the awaiting too and gives it the character of a depressed \nor bewildered awaiting which is distinct from any pure expectation. \nThe specific ecstatical unity which makes it existentially possible to be \nafraid, temporalizes itself primarily out of the kind offorgetting character\u00ad\nized above, which, as a mode of having been, modifies its Present and \nits future in their own temporalizing. The temporality offear is a forgetting \nwhich awaits and makes present. The common-sense interpretation of \nfear, taking its orientation from what we encounter within-the-world, \nseeks in the first instance to designate the 'oncoming evil' as that \nin the face of which we fear, and, correspondingly, to define our \nrelation to this evil as one of \"expecting\". Anything else which \n1 'Deren existenzial-zeitlicher Sinn wird konstituiert durch ein Sichvergessen : das \nverwirrte Ausriicken vor dem eigenen faktischen Seinkonnen, als welches das bedrohte \nIn-der-Welt-sein das Zuhandene besorgt.' \n2 'Bei keiner halt der Fiirchtende, die \"Umwelt\" verschwindet nicht, sondern begegnet \nin einem Sich-nicht-mehr-auskennen in ihr.' \n3 'Das selbstvergessene Gegenwartigen eines Gewirrs von schwebenden Moglichkeiten \nermoglicht die Verwirrung, als welche sie den Stimmungscharakter der Furcht ausmacht.' \nThe pronoun 'sie' does not appear in the older editions. \n"

But just as little does \nanxiety imply that one has already taken over one's existence into one's \nresolution and done so by a repeating. On the contrary, anxiety brings \none back to one's thrownness as something possible which can be repeated. \nAnd in this way it also reveals the possibility of an authentic potentiality\u00ad\nfor-Being-a potentiality which must, in repeating, come back to its \nthrown \"there\", but come back as something future which comes towards \n[ zukiinftiges]. The character of having been is constitutive for the state-of\u00ad\nmind of anxiery; and bringing one face to face with repeatabiliry is the specific \necstatical mode of this character. \n344 \nThe forgetting which is constitutive for fear, bewilders Dasein and lets \nit drift back and forth between 'worldly' possibilities which it has not seized \nupon. In contrast to this making-present which is not held on to, the Pre\u00ad\nsent of anxiety is held on to when one brings oneself back to one's ownmost \nthrownness. The existential meaning of anxiety is such that it cannot lose \nitself in something with which it might be concerned. If anything like \nthis happens in a similar state-of-mind, this is fear, which the everyday \nunderstanding confuses with anxiety. But even though the Present of \nanxiety is held on to, it does not as yet have the character of the moment of \nvision, which temporalizes itself in a resolution. Anxiety merely brings \none into the mood for a possible resolution. The Present of anxiety holds \nthe moment of vision at the ready [arif dem Sprung] ; as such a moment it \nitself, and only itself, is possible. \nThe temporality of anxiety is peculiar; for anxiety is grounded pri\u00ad\nmordially in having been, and only out of this do the future and the Present \ntemporalize themselves ; in this peculiar temporality is demonstrated the \npossibility of that power which is distinctive for the mood of anxiety. In \nthis, Dasein is taken all the way back to its naked uncanniness, and becomes \nfascinated byit.1 This fascination, however, not only takes Dasein back from \nits 'worldly' possibilities, but at the same time gives it the possibility of an \nauthentic potentiality-for-Being. \n1 'An der eigentiimlichen Zeitlichkeit der Angst, class sie urspriinglich in der Gewesen\u00ad\nheit griindet und aus ihr erst Zukunft und Gegenwart sich zeitigen, erweist sich die \nMiigichkeit der Miichtigkeit, durch die sich die Stimmung der Angst auszeichnet. In ihr \nist das Dasein viillig auf seine nackte Unheimlichkeit zuriickgenommen und von ihr be\u00ad\nnommen.' In these two sentences there are no less than six feminine nouns which might \nserve as the antecedents of the pronouns 'sie' and 'ihr' in their several appearances. We \nhave chosen the interpretation which seems most plausible to us, but others are perhaps \nno less defensible. The etymological connection between 'zuriickgenommen' ('taken . . .  \nback') and 'benommen' ('fascinated') does not show up in the English version; it is \nobviously deliberate, and it gets followed up in the next sentence. \n"

Anxiety, however, springs \nfrom Dasein itself. When fear assails us, it does so from what is within\u00ad\nthe-world. Anxiety arises out of Being-in-the-world as thrown Being\u00ad\ntowards-death. When understood temporally, this 'mounting' of anxiety \nout ofDasein, means that the future and the Present of anxiety temporalize \nthemselves out of a primordial Being-as-having-been in the sense of \nbringing us back to repeatability. But anxiety can mount authentically \nonly in a Dasein which is resolute. He who is resolute knows no fear; \nbut he understands the possibility of anxiety as the possibility of the very \nmood which neither inhibits nor bewilders him. Anxiety liberates him \nfrom possibilities which 'count for nothing' [\"nichtigen\"], and lets him \nbecome free for those which are authentic. \u00b7l \nAlthough both fear and anxiety, as modes of state-of-mind, are grounded \nprimarily in having been, they each have different sources with regard to \ntheir own temporalization in the temporality of care. Anxiety springs from \nthe future of resoluteness, while fear springs from the lost Present, of which \n345 \nfear is fearfully apprehensive, so that it falls prey to it more than ever. 2 \nBut may not the thesis of the temporality of moods hold only for those \nphenomena which we have selected for our analysis ? How is a temporal \nmeaning to be found in the pallid lack of mood which dominates the 'grey \neveryday' through and through ? And how about the temporality of such \nmoods and affects as hope, joy, enthusiasm, gaiety ? Not only fear and \nanxiety, but other moods, are founded existentially upon one's hav\u00ad\ning been; this becomes plain if we merely mention such phenomena as \nsatiety, sadness, melancholy, and desperation .. Of course these must be \nInterpreted on the broader basis of an existential analytic of Dasein that \nhas been well worked out. But even a phenomenon like hope, which seems \nto be founded wholly upon the future, must be analysed in much the same \nway as fear. Hope has sometimes been characterized as the expectation \nof a bonum futurum, to distinguish it from fear, which relates itself to a \nmalum futurum. But what is decisive for the structure of hope as a pheno\u00ad\nmenon, is not so much the 'futural' character of that to which it relates itself \n1 'Beide Stimmungen, Furcht und Angst, \"kommen\" jedoch nie nur isoliert \"vor\" im \n\"Erlebnisstrom\", sondem be-stimmen je ein Verstehen, bzw. sich aus einem solchen.' \nHeidegger writes 'be-stimmen' with a hyphen to call attention to the fact that the words \n'bestimmen' ('determine') and 'Stimmung' ('mood') have a common stem. \n2 'Die Angst entspringt aus der Zukunft der Entschlossenheit, die Furcht aus der \nverlorenen Gegenwart, die furchtsam die Furcht befirchtet, urn ihr so erst recht zu \nverfallen.'

Such a mood of elation--or better, one which \nelates-is ontologically possible only if Dasein has an ecstatico-temporal \nrelation to the thrown ground of itself. \nFurthermore, the pallid lack of mood-indifference-which is addicted \nto nothing and has no urge for anything, and which abandons itself to \nwhatever the day may bring, yet in so doing takes everything along with \nit in a certain manner, demonstrates most penetratingly the power of for\u00ad\ngetting in the everyday mode of that concern which is closest to us. \nJust living along [Das Dahinleben] in a way which 'lets' everything 'be' \nas it is, is based on forgetting and abandoning oneself to one's thrownness. \nIt has the ecstatical meaning of an inauthentic way of having been. \nIndifference, which can go along with busying oneself head over heels, \nmust be sharply distinguished from equanimity.

Of course \nwhen one speaks of the rapture with which one's existence is carried away \nin making present, this does not signify that Dasein detaches itself from \nits Self and its \"I\". Even when it makes present in the most extreme \nmanner, it remains temporal-that is, awaiting and forgetful. In making \npresent, moreover, Dasein still understands itself, though it has been \nalienated from its ownmost potentiality-for-Being, which is based primarily \non the authentic future and on authentically having been. But in so far \nas making-present is always offering something 'new', it does not let \nDasein come back to itself and is constantly tranquillizing it anew. This \ntranquillizing, however, strengthens in turn the tendency towards leaping \naway. Curiosity is 'activated' not by the endless immensity of what we \nhave not yet seen, but rather by the falling kind of temporalizing which \nbelongs to the Present as it leaps away. 2 Even if one has seen everything, \nthis is precisely when curiosity fabricates something new. \nAs a mode of temporalizing, the 'leaping-away' of the Present is \ngrounded in the essence of temporality, which is finite.

Temporality temporalizes itself as a future which makes \npresent in the process of having been. \nBoth the disclosedness of the \"there\" and Dasein's basic existentiell \npossibilities, authenticity and inauthenticity, are founded upon tempora\u00ad\nlity. But disclosedness always pertains with equal primordiality to the \nentirety of Being-in-the-world-to Being-in as well as to the world. So if we \norient ourselves by the temporal Constitution of disclosedness, the onto\u00ad\nlogical condition for the possibility that there can be entities which exist \nas Being-in-the-world, must be something that may also be exhibited. \n\u00c8 69. The Temporality of Being-in-the-world and the Problem of the Transcendence \nof the World \nThe ecstatical unity of temporality-that is, the unity of the 'outside\u00ad\nof-itself' in the raptures of the future, of what has been, and of the Present \n-is the condition for the possibility that there can be an entity which \nexists as its \"there\". The entity which bears the title \"Being-there\" is one \nthat has been 'cleared'.xiv The light which constitutes this clearedness \n[Gelicl>tetheit] of Dasein, is not something ontically present-at-hand as a \npower or source for a radiant brightness occurring in the entity on occasion. \nThat by which this entity is essentially cleared-in other words, that \nwhich makes it both 'open' for itself and 'bright' for itself-is what we \n"

On the contrary, what such an exposition accomplishes is the \nclarification of those structures with regard to which the problem of trans\u00ad\ncendence must be raised-a clarification which is necessary beforehand. In \nthe existential-temporal Interpretation of Being-in-the-world, three things \n352 \nwil be considered : (a) the temporality of circumspective concern; (b) the \ntemporal meaning of the way in which circumspective concern becomes \nmodified into theoretical knowledge of what is present-at-hand within\u00ad\nthe-world ; (c) the temporal problem of the transcendence of the world. \n(a) The Temporality ofCircumspective Concern \nHow are we to obtain the right point of view for analysing the tempora\u00ad\nlity of concern ? We have called concernful Being alongside the 'world' \nour \"dealings in and with the environment\".xv As phenomena which are \nexamples of Being alongside, we have chosen the using, manipulation, \nand producing of the ready-to-hand, and the deficient and undiffer\u00ad\nentiated modes of these ; that is, we have chosen ways of Being alongside \nwhat belongs to one's everyday needs.xvt In this kind of concern Dasein's \nauthentic existence too maintains itself, even when for such existence this \nconcern is 'a matter of indifference'. The ready-to-hand things with \nwhich we concern ourselves are not the causes of our concern, as if this \nwere to arise only by the effects of entities within-the-world. Being along\u00ad\nside the ready-to-hand cannot be explained ontically in terms of the \nready-to-hand itself, nor can the ready-to-hand be derived contrariwise \nfrom this kind of Being. But neither are concern, as a kind of Being which \nbelongs to Dasein, and that with which we concern ourselves, as some\u00ad\nthing ready-to-hand within-the-world, just present-at-hand together. All the \nsame, a 'connection' subsists between them. That which is dealt with, if \nrightly understood, sheds light upon concernful dealings themselves. And \nfurthermore, if we mis the phenomenal structure of what is dealt with, \nthen we fail to recognize the existential constitution of dealing. Of course \nwe have already made an essential gain for the analysis of those entities \nwhich we encounter as closest to us, if their specific character as equip\u00ad\nment does not get passed over. But we must understand further that \nconcernful dealings never dwell with any individual item of equipment. \nOur using and manipulating of any definite item of equipment still \nremains oriented towards some equipmental context. If, for instance, we \nare searching for some equipment which we have 'misplaced', then what \nwe have in mind is not merely what we are searching for, or even primarily \nthis ; nor do we have it in mind in an isolated 'act' ; but the range of the \nequipmental totality has already been discovered beforehand.

This way of taking what is dealt with, is forced \nupon us also if we consider that character of Being which belongs dis\u00ad\ntinctively to equipment that is ready-to-hand-namely, involvemene.xvu \nWe understand the term \"involvement\" ontologically. The kind of talk in \nwhich we say that something has with it an involvement in something, is \nnot meant to establish a fact ontically, but rather to indicate the kind of \nBeing that belongs to what is ready-to-hand. The relational character of \ninvolvement-of its 'with . . .  in . .  .'-suggests that \"an\" equipment is \nontologically impossible. Of course just a solitary item of equipment may \nbe ready-to-hand while another is missing. But this makes known to us \nthat the very thing that is ready-to-hand belongs to something else. Our \nconcernful dealings can let what is ready-to-hand be encountered circum\u00ad\nspectively only if in these dealings we already understand something like \nthe involvement which something has in something. The Being-alongside \nwhich discovers circumspectively in concern, amounts to letting something \nbe involved-that is, to projecting an involvement understandingly. \nLetting things be involved makes up the existential structure of concern. But concern, \nas Being alongside something, belongs to the essential constitution of care; and care, \nin turn, is grounded in temporality. If all this is so, then the existential condition of \nthe possibility of letting things be involved must be sought in a mode of the tem\u00ad\nporalizing of temporality. \nLetting something be involved is implied in the simplest handling of an \nitem of equipment. That which we let it be involved i n  [Das Wobei \ndesselben] has the character of a \"towards-which\" ; with regard to this, \nthe equipment is either usable or in use. The understanding of the \n\"towards-which\"-that is, the understanding of what the equipment is \ninvolved in-has the temporal structure of awaiting. In awaiting the \n\"towards-which\", concern can at the same time come back by itself to the \nsort of thing in which it is involved. The awaiting of what it is involved in, \nand-together with this awaiting-the retaining of that which is thus \ninvolved, make possible in its ecstatical unity the specifically manipulative \nway in which equipment is made present.l \n1 'Das Gtwiirtigen des Wobei in eins mit dem Behalten des Womit der Bewandtnis \nerm()glicht in seiner ekstatischen Einheit das spezifisch hantierende Gegenwiirtigen des \nZeugs.' \n"

It has by no means the character of getting something themati-\ncally into one's grasp. Neither does the retaining of that which has an \ninvolvement signify holding it fast thematically. Manipulative dealings \nno more relate themselves merely to that in which we let something be \ninvolved, than they do to what is involved itself. Letting something be \n354 \ninvolved is constituted rather in the unity of a retention which awaits, \nand it is constituted in such a manner, indeed, that the making-present \nwhich arises from this, makes possible the characteristic absorption of \nconcern in its equipmental world. When one is wholly devoted to some-\nthing and 'really' busies oneself with it, one does not do so just alongside \nthe work itself, or alongside the tool, or alongside both of them 'together'. \nThe unity of the relations in which concern circumspectively 'operates', \nhas been established already by letting-things-be-involved-which is \nbased upon temporality. \nA specific kind ofjorgetting is essential for the temporality that b con\u00ad\nstitutive for letting something be involved. The Self must forget itself if, \nlost in the world of equipment, it is to be able 'actually' to go to work and \nmanipulate something. But all the same, inasmuch as an awaiting always \nleads the way in the unity of the temporalizing of concern, concemful \nDasein's own potentiality-for-Being has, as we shall show, been given a \nposition in care.l \nThe making-present which awaits and retains, is constitutive for that \nfamiliarity in accordance with which Dasein, as Being-with-one-another, \n'knows its way about' [sich \"auskennt\"] in its public environment. Letting \nthings be involved is something which we understand existentially as a \nletting-them-'be' [ein \"Sein\"-lassen]. On such a basis circumspection can \nencounter the ready-to-hand as that entity which it is. Hence we can further \nelucidate the temporality of concern by giving heed to those modes of \ncircumspectively letting something be encountered which we have \ncharacterized abovexvill as \"conspicuousness\", \"obtrusiveness\", and \n\"obstinacy\". Thematical perception of Things is precisely not the way \nequipment ready-to-hand is encountered in its 'true \"in-itself\" '; it is \nencountered rather in the inconspicuousness of what we can come across \n'obviously' and 'Objectively'. But if there is something conspicuous in \nthe totality of such entities, this implies that the equipmental totality as \nsuch is obtruding itself along with it. What sort of existential structure \nmust belong to letting things be involved, if such a procedure can let \nsomething be encountered as conspicuous ?
