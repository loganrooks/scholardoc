Whatever has been unbidden to human \nbeings at any given time, as well as the manner of its unhiddenness, has to \nbe transformed. In Greek, unhiddenness is called a/..<9t\u0004a. a word that we \ntranslate as \"truth.\" And for a long time now in Western thinking, truth \nhas meant the agreement of the representation in thought with the thing \nitself: adaequatio intellectus et rei. \nBut if we are not satisfied with simply translating the words 1ta\u01078\u00a3la \nand a/..<Ot\u0108a \"literally,\" if instead we attempt [125] to think through the \nissue according to the Greek way of knowing and to ponder the essential \nmatter that is at stake in these translations, then straightaway \"education\" \nand \"truth\" come together into an essential unity. If we take seriously the \nessential content of what the word aJ.l)9t\u0004a names, then we must ask: From \nwhat perspective does Plato approach his detennination of the essence of \nunhiddenness? For the answer to this question we are referred to the proper \ncontent of the \"allegory of the cave.\" The answer will show both the fact \nthat and the way in which the \"allegory\" deals with the essence of truth. \nThe unbidden and its unhiddenness designate at each point what is \npresent and manifest in the region where human beings happen to dwell. \nBut the \"allegory\" recounts a story of passages from one dwelling place to \nanother. Thus this story is divided in a general way into a series of four \ndifferent dwelling places in specific gradations of up and down. The dis\u00ad\ntinctions between the dwelling places and stages within the movement of \npassage are grounded in the different kinds of liA\"fl9tc; nonnative at each \nlevel, that is, the different kinds of\"truth\" that are dominant at each stage. \nFor that reason, in one way or another we have to think out and designate \nwhat the liA\"fl9tc;, the unbidden, is at each stage. \nIn stage one, people live chained inside the cave, engrossed in what \nthey immediately encounter. The description of this dwelling place ends \nwith the emphatic sentence: lta\\l'taltao\u0004 8\u001e . . .  oL \"tOWG\"tm o\u2022)x &\" &J.A.o n \n\\IOf!LCo\u0004\u00a3\\1 1:0 &J.ljOtc; Yj 1:ac; \"tW\\1 oxt\u2022JaO\"\"tW\\1 ox\u0004ac; (5 I 5 ci-1). \"In no way, \nthen, would those who are chained like this ever consider anything else to \nbe the unbidden except the shadows cast by the artifacts.\" \nStage two tells about the removal of the chains.

Authentic liberation \nis the steadiness of being oriented toward that which appears in its visible \nform and which is the most unhidden in this appearing.

Hence the telling of the story \ndoes not end, as is often supposed, with the description of the highest level \nattained in the ascent out of the cave. On the contrary, the \"allegory\" in\u00ad\ncludes the story of the descent of the freed person back into the cave, back \nto those who are still in chains. The one who has been freed is supposed \nto lead these people too away from what is unhidden for them and to bring \nthem face to face with the most unbidden. But the would-be liberator no \nlonger knows his or her way around the cave and risks the danger of suc\u00ad\ncumbing to the overwhelming power of the kind of truth that is normative \nthere, the danger of being overcome by the claim of the common \"reality\" \n[1 29] to be the only reality. The liberator is threatened with the possibil\u00ad\nity of being put to death, a possibility that became a reality in the fate of \nSocrates, who was Plato's \"teacher.\" \nThe return to the cave and the battle waged within the cave between the \nliberator and the prisoners who resist all liberation, of itself makes up stage \nfour of the \"allegory,\" where the story comes to a conclusion. Admittedly \nthe word ai-r.O\u051dc; is no longer used in this part of the story. Nonetheless this \nstage also has to deal with the unbidden that conditions the area of the cave \nthat the freed person now visits once again. But was not the \"unhidden\" \nthat is normative in the cave - the shadows - already mentioned in stage \none? Yes, it was. But two factors are essential to the unbidden: not only \ndoes it in some way or other render accessible whatever appears and keep \nit revealed in its appearing, but it also constantly overcomes a hiddenness \nof the hidden. The unbidden must be tom away from a hiddenness; it \nmust in a sense be stolen from hiddenness. Originally for the Greeks\u2022 \nhiddenness, as an act of self-hiding, permeated the essence of being and \nthus also determined beings in their presentness and accessibility (\"truth\"); \nand that is why the Greek word for what the Romans call \"veritas\" and for \nwhat we call \"truth\" was distinguished by the alpha-privative (a-/..f,OEL::t). \nTruthb originally means what has been wrested from hiddenness.c Truth is \nthus a wresting away in each case, in the form of a revealing. The hiddenness \ncan be of various kinds: closing off, hiding away, disguising, covering over, \nmasking, dissembling. Since, according to Plato's \"allegory,\" the supremely \nunbidden must be wrested from a base and stubborn hiding, for this reason \none's movement out of the cave into the open and into the light of day is \n3 Of\u0525lrint from G.-istCv;r 0/lrr/irfrmng, 19_.z : l leraclitus, fragment l l  J. \nh Offprint from Gri.rtigt Vbrrlirftnmg, 1 9_.z : In the sense of that which is true. \n<.

The visible form \nprovides a view of that as which any given being is present. The reflection \nproper aims at the i8tct. The \"idea\" is the visible fonn that offers a view of \nwhat is present. The i8tct is pure shining in the sense of the phrase \"the sun \nshines.\" The \"idea\" does not first let something else {behind it) \"shine in its \nappearance\" [\"er.rcheinenj; it itself is what shines, it is concerned only with \nthe shining of itself. The t8tct is that which can shine [das Scheinsame]. The \nessence of the idea consists in its ability to shine and be seen [Schein- und \nSichtsamkeit]. This is what brings about presencing, specifically the coming \nto presence of what a being is in any given instance. A being becomes \npresent in each case in its whatness. But after all, coming to presence is the \nessence of being. That is why for Plato the proper essence of being consists \nin whatness. Even later terminology shows this: quiditas, and not existentia, \nis true ese, i.e., essentia. 'What the idea, in its shining forth, brings into view \nand thereby lets us see is - for the gaze focused on that idea - the unhidden \nof that as which the idea appears. This unbidden is grasped antecedently \nand by itself as that which is apprehended in apprehending the i8tct, as \nthat which is known (y\fyv(a)GXOf.1Evov) in the act of knowing (yHyv\u0159axE\u0202v). \nOnly in this Platonic revolution do vot\u01d9v and vovc; (apprehending) first get \nreferred essentially to the \"idea.\" The adoption of this orientation to the \nideas henceforth determines the essence of apprehension [ Vm2ehmung] and \nsubsequently the essence of\"reason\" (\"Vernunftj. \n[1p] \"Unhiddenness\" now means: the unbidden always as what is ac\u00ad\ncessible thanks to the idea's ability to shine. But insofar as the access is \nnecessarily carried out through \"seeing,\" unhiddenness is yoked into a \"re\u00ad\nlation\" with seeing, it becomes \"relative\" to seeing. Thus toward the end of \nBook VI of the Republic Plato develops the question: 'What makes the thing \nseen and the act of seeing be what they are in their relation? What spans the \nspace between them? 'What yoke (C,Jyov, soS a1) holds the two together? \nThe \"allegory of the cave\" was written in order to illustrate the answer, \nwhich is set forth in an image: The sun as source of light lends visibility to \nwhatever is seen. But seeing sees what is visible only insofar as the eye is \ni;AwEH8tc;, \"sunlike\" by having the power to participate in the sun's kind of \nessence, that is, its shining. The eye itself \"emits light\" and devotes itself \nto the shining and in this way is able to receive and apprehend whatever \nappears.

The same ambiguity in the detennination of the essence of truth still \nprevails in Aristotle as well. In the closing chapter of Book IX of the Meta\u00ad\nphysics (Metaphysics f-), 10, 1051 a34ff.) where Aristotelian thinking on the \nbeing of beings reaches its peak, unhiddenness is the all-controlling fun\u00ad\ndamental trait of beings.

From now on this characterization of the essence \nof truth as the correcmess of both representation and assertion becomes \nnormative for the whole of Western thinking. As evidence of that, let it \nsuffice to cite the guiding theses that typify the characterizations of the \nessence of truth in the main epochs of metaphysics. \nFor medieval Scholasticism, Thomas Aquinas's thesis holds good: veri\u00ad\nrae proprie invenitur in intellectu humano vel divino (Quaestiones de Veritate, \nquaestio I, articulus 4\u2022 responsio): \"Truth is properly encountered in the \nhuman or in the divine intellect.\" The intellect is where truth has its essen\u00ad\ntial locus.

In the \nfinal analysis, the value for life is what is decisive.\" (Note from the year \nt HHs. The Will to Powt:r, number 493.) If for Nietzsche truth is a kind \nof error, then its essence consists in a way of thinking that always, indeed \nnecessarily, falsifies the real, specifically insofar as every act of representing \nhalts the continual \"becoming\" and, in erecting its established facts against \nthe flow of\"becoming,\" sets up as the supposedly real something that does \nnot correspond - i.e., something incorrect and thus erroneous. \nNietzsche's determination of truth as the incorrecmess of thinking is in \nagreement with the traditional essence of truth as the correcmess of asser\u00ad\ntion (Myoc;). Nietzsche's concept of truth displays the last glimmer of the \nmost extreme consequence of the change of truth from the unhiddenness \nof beings to the correcmess of the gaze. The change itself is brought about \nin the determination of the being of beings (in Greek: the being present of \nwhat is present) as i8\u00a31l. \nA5 a consequence of this interpretation of beings, being present is no \nlonger what it was in the beginning of Western thinking: the emergence \nof the hidden into unhiddenness, where unhiddenness itself, as revealing, \nconstitutes the fundamental trait of being present. Plato conceives being \npresent (o,)otll) as i8\u00a31l. However, i8tll is not subordinate to unbidden\u00ad\nness in the sense of serving what is unhidden by bringing it to appearance. \nRather, the opposite is the case: it is the shining (the self-showing) that, \nwithin its essence and in a singular self-relatedness, may yet be called un\u00ad\nhiddenness. The i8\u00a31l is not [ 140] some foreground that \nt,OELil puts out \nthere tO present things;7 rather, the i8\u00a31l is the ground that makes a).f,(JELil \npossible. But even as such the i8\u00a31l still lays claim to something of the \noriginal but unacknowledged essence of ai.f,OELil. \nTruth is no longer, as it was qua unhiddenness, the fundamental trait \nof being itself. Instead, as a consequence of getting yoked under the idea, \ntruth has become correcmess, and henceforth it will be a characteristic of \nthe knowing of beings. \nEver since, there has been a striving for \"truth\" in the sense of the \ncorrecmess of the gaze and the correctness of its direction. Ever since, what \nmatters in all our fundamental orientations toward beings is the achieving \nof a correct view of the ideas. The reflection on \u00a4llLOELil and the change in \n179 \n"

Natura \nmeans \"that which lets something originate from itself.\" \nSince those times \"nature\" has become the fundamental word that des\u00ad\nignates essential relations that Western historical humanity has to beings, \nboth to itself and to beings other than itself. This fact is shown by a rough \nlist of dichotomies that have become prevalent: nature and grace (i.e., \nsuper-nature), nature and art, nature and history, nature and spirit. But we \nlikewise speak of the \"nature\" of spirit, the \"nature\" of history, and the \"na\u00ad\nture\" of the human being. By this last phrase we mean not just one's body \nor even the species \"human,\" but one's whole essence. Therefore generaUy \nwhen we speak of the \"nature of things,\" we mean what things are in their \n\"possibility\" and huw they are, regardless of whether and to what degree \nthey \"actually\" are. \nIn Christian thought, the human being's \"natural state\" means what is \nbestowed upon humans in creation and turned over to their freedom. Left to \nitself, this \"nature,\" through the passions, brings about the total destruction \nof the human being. For this reason \"nature\" must be suppressed. It is in a \ncertain sense what should not be. \nIn another interpretation, it is precisely the unleashing of the drives and \npassions that is natural for human beings. According to Nietzsche, humo \nnaturae is someone who makes the \"body\" the key to the interpretation \nof the world and who thus secures a new and harmonious relation to the \n\"sensible\" in general, to the \"elements\" (fire, water, earth, light), to the \npassions and drives and whatever is conditioned by them. And at the same \ntime, in vinue of this new relation these people bring \"the elemental\" into \ntheir power [3 10] and by this power make themselves capable of the mastery \nof the world in the sense of a systematic world-domination. \n"

However, the chief reason for continuing to use \nthe untranslated and perhaps untranslatable word cp\u2022)aLC; lies in the fact that \neverything said up to this point toward the clarification of its essence is \nonly prologue. In fact, up until now we do not even know what kind of \nreflection and inquiry is already at work when we ask about 'fl'JaLc; as we have \nbeen doing. And these things Aristotle tells us only now in the passage we \nhave just read, a text that establishes with extreme succincmess the horizon \nwithin which the discussion moves, both the preceding part and especially \nwhat is to follow. \nThe decisive sentence reads: xat lan ltlivta taut a oua(a, \"and all these -\nnamely, t.pua\u00a3L-beings - have being of the type called beingnes.\" This ex\u00ad\npression \"beingness,\" [330] which hardly strikes the ear as elegant, is the \nonly adequate translation for oua(a. Granted, even \"beingness\" says very \nlittle, in fact, almost nothing, but this is precisely its advantage.

The word o6ala was not originally a \nphilosophical \"term\" any more than was the word xat'lyop(a, which we have \nalready explained. The word o\u2022)o(a was first coined as a technical \"term\" \nby Aristode. This coining consists in the fact that Aristode thoughtfully \ndraws out of the content of the word a crucial element and then holds on \nto it firmly and clearly. Nonetheless, at the time of Aristode and even later, \nthe word still retained its ordinary meaning, whereby it signified house \nand home, holdings, financial means; we might also say \"present assets,\" \n\"property,\" what lies present. We must think in terms of this meaning if we \nwant to get at the naming power of o\u2022)a(a as a basic philosophical word. \nAnd then right away we also see how simple and obvious is the explanation \nAristode provides for the word ot)akz in the text above: t);.ox\u00a3L!l\u00a3vov yap \nn x:tt E:v \u2022)r.oXELfltv\u0517 E:att v \u0175 '?'JIJL<; :i\u00a3L, \"for in each case rp\u2022)tJLc; is like a \nlying-present and 'in' a lying-present.\" One might object that our transla\u00ad\ntion here is \"wrong.\" Aristotle's sentence does not say \u2022)r.ox\u00a3io0cu yap n, \na \"lying-present\" [Vorliegen] but rather \"something that lies present\" [ein \nVorliegmdes]. But here we must pay strict attention to what the sentence \nis supposed to explain: namely, to what extent '?'JO\"Lc; is o\u2022io(a and thus has \nthe character of beingness (being).

Both interpretations of !p\u2022)aLc; are given equal rank, \nand this offers the possibility of constructing a double concept of 1fiUGLc,. \nBut in line with this, the first task incumbent upon us is to show that !Jop1pf, \nis the proper characteristic of the essence of rpuaLc;. \nThis is the way it seems at first glance, but in fact everything shapes up \nquite differently. The vA\"l--f.lOprp\u0017 distinction is not simply another formula \nfor appu0flLatov\u0527\u2022Jf1fl6c;. Rather, it lifts the question of t.puaLc; onto an \nentirely new level where precisely the unasked question about the x(v\"laLc;\u00ad\ncharacter of [344] rpuaLc; gets answered, and where 1fiVGL<; for the first time is \nadequately conceived as ova(a, a kind of presencing. This likewise implies \nthat, despite appearances to the contrary, the aforementioned theory of \nAntiphon is rejected with the sharpest kind of refutation. We can see all this \nwith sufficient clarity only if we understand the now emerging distinction \nbetween UAl)-f.!Op!pf, in an Aristotelian - i.e., Greek - sense and do not lose \nthis understanding again right away. We are constantly on the verge of \nlosing it because the distinction between \"matter\" and \"form\" is a common \nroad that Western thinking has traveled for centuries now. The distinction \nbetween content and form passes for the most obvious of all things obvious. \nTherefore, why should not the Greeks, too, have already thought according \nto this \"schema\"? \n[ lAr,-!Jop1pf, was translated by the Romans as materia and \nforma. With the interpretation implied in this translation the distinction \nwas carried over into the Middle Ages and modem times. Kant understands \nit as the distinction between \"matter\" and \"form,\" which he explains as the \ndistinction between the \"detenninable\" and its \"determination.\" (Cf. The \nCritique of Pure Reason, \"The Amphiboly of Concepts of Reflection,\" Az 66, \nBpz.) With this we reach the point furthest removed from Aristotle's \nGreek distinction. \n\"'TAr, in the ordinary sense means \"forest,\" \"thicket,\" the \"woods\" in \nwhich the hunter hunts. But it likewise means the woods that yield wood \n"

Therefore, in interpreting the ensuing determination of \nthe essence of tJoprpf, as \u00a3l8oc;, we must watch whether and to what extent \nAristotle himself follows this clue. In anticipation we can say: !loprpf, is \"ap\u00ad\npearance,\" more precisely, the act of standing in and placing itself into the \nappearance; in general, poprpf, means: placing into the appearance. There\u00ad\nfore, in what follows when we speak simply of\"appearance,\" we always have \nin mind the appearance as (and insofar as) it puts itself fonh into a given \nthing that is \"there for a while\" (for example, the \"appearance\" \"table\" \nthat puts itself fonh into this table here). We call an individual thing das \nJweilige, \"that which is there for a while,\" because as an individual thing \nit \"stays for a while\" in its appearance and preserves the \"while\" (the pres\u00ad\nencing) of this appearance, and, by preserving the appearance, stands fonh \nin it and out of it - which means that it \"is\" in the Greek sense of the word. \nBy translating tJoprpf, as placing into the appearance, we mean to express \ninitially two things that are of equal importance to the sense of the Greek \nterm but that are thoroughly lacking in our word \"form.\" First, placing \ninto the appearance is a mode of presencing, o,:Jata. Moprpf, is not an ontic \nproperty present in matter, but a way of being. Second, \"placing into the \nappearance\" is movedness, xtvr,mc;, which \"moment\" is radically lacking in \nthe concept of fonn. \nBut this reference to the Greek way of understanding the meaning of \n!loprpf, in no way constitutes a demonstration of what Aristotle has un\u00ad\ndenaken to show, namely, that rpua\fc; itself, according to a second way of \naddressing it, is tJOprp\u0017. This demonstration, which takes up the rest of the \nchapter, goes through various stages in such a way that each stage lifts the \ntask of the demonstration one level higher. The demonstration begins in \nthis way: \nXIII. \"Just as we (loosely) call by the name 'ttxvr, those things produced according \nto such a know-how, as well as whatever belongs to those kinds of beings, so too \nwe (loosely) designate as \u2022j)\u2022)al::; whatever is according to \u2022p\u2022)m::; and hence belongs \nto beings of this kind. But on the other hand, just as we would [347) never say \nthat something behaves (and is present) in accordance with 'ttzvr,, or that 'ttzvr, is \nthere, when something is a bedstead merely in terms of appropriateness (8\u2022Jv:l!ltl) \nbut in fact does not at all have the appearance of the bedstead, so neither would \nwe proceed that way in addressing something that has composed itself into a stand \nhy way of \u2022p\u2022)m::;. For whatever is flesh and bone only in terms of appropriateness \ndocs not have the \u2022p\u2022)al::; that appertains to it until it achieves the appearance that \nwe refer to in addressing the thing and that we delineate when we say what flesh or \nhone is; nor is (something that is merely appropriate) already a being from '?')ma.\" \n(193 aJI-bJ) \n2 I I \n"

But still, nothing is yet gained by establishing that \n1.\u00a3y\u00a3L'I means \"to collect.\" Despite correct reference to root meanings, one \ncan still misconstrue the genuine content of the Greek word and understand \nthe concept of A6yoc; incorrectly by adhering to the meaning that has been \nprevalent up until now. \n[349] \"To collect,\" to gather, means: to bring various dispersed things \ntogether into a unity, and at the same time to bring this unity forth and hand \nit over (:tapa). Into what? Into the unbidden of presencing [r.apouola = \no\u2022)ola (a\u015ctouota)]. Aty\u00a3L'I means to bring together into a unity and to bring \nforth this unity as gathered, i.e., above all as present; thus it means the same \nas to reveal what was formerly hidden. to let it be manifest in its presencing. \nThus according to Aristotle the essence of an assertion is a\u015ct6cpavoLc;: letting \nbe seen, from the being itself, what and how the being is. He also calls this \nto 8'll.o\\.iv, the act of revealing. In so doing, Aristotle is not giving a special \n\"theory\" ofA6yoc;, but only preserves what the Greeks always recognized as \nthe essence ofAtym. Fragment 93 of Heraclitus shows this magnificently: \n6 iiva\u0104. 01J 'tO fla'l't\u00a3L6'1 ton 'tO tv \u051cEAtpoi:c;, OU't\u00a3 l.ty\u00a3L OU't\u00a3 XpVlt'tEL al.l.a \nO'lflatv\u00a3L. The philologists (e.g., Diels, Snell) translate: \"The lord whose \noracle is at Delphi says nothing, does not speak and does not conceal, \nbut gives a sign.\" This translation deprives Heraclitus's saying of its basic \ncontent and its authentic Heraclitean tension and resistance. Ovt\u00a3 l.ty\u00a3L \noiht xp(mt\u00a3L: here the word l.ty\u00a3L'I is opposed to xp\u2022.Jltt\u00a3Lv, \"to conceal,\" \nand for this reason we must translate it as \"to unconceal,\" i.e., to reveal. \nThe oracle does not directly llnconceal nor does it simply conceal, but it \npoints out. This means: it unconceals while it conceals, and it conceals \nwhile it unconceals. [For how this l.\u00a3y\u00a3Lv is related to J..Oyoc; and for what \nA6yoc; means to Heraclitus, cf. fragments 1 and z and others.] \nIn the Greek definition of the essence of the hwnan being, i.ty\u00a3Lv and \nA6yoc; mean the relation on the basis of which what is present gathers itself \nfor the first time as such around and for human beings. And only because \nhuman beings are insofar as they relate to beings as beings, unconcealing \nand concealing them, can they and must they have the \"word,\" i.e., speak \nof the being of beings. But the words that language uses are only fragments \nthat have precipitated out of the word, [350] and from them humans can \nnever find their way to beings or find the path back to them, unless it be on \nthe basis ofMy\u00a3L'I.

Only when language has been debased to a means of \ncommerce and organization, as is the case with us, does thought rooted in \nlanguage appear to be a mere \"philosophy of words,\" no longer adequate to \nthe \"pressing realities of life.\" This judgment is simply an admission that \nwe ourselves no longer have the power to trust that the word is the essential \nfoundation of all relations to beings as such. \nBut why do we lose ourselves in this wide-ranging digression into an \nexplanation of the essence ofA6yo<; when our question is about the essence \nof \u2022p\u2022)m<;? Answer: in order to make clear that when Aristotle appeals to \nAty\u00a3af1aL he is not relying extraneously on some \"linguistic usage\" but is \nthinking out of the original and fundamental relation to beings. Thus this \nseemingly superficial beginning to the demonstration regains its proper \nimport: if beings having in themselves the origin and ordering of their \nmovedness are experienced by means ofMy\u00a3Lv, then as a result flOprp\u0017 itself \nand not just UA7J (not to mention &ppuf1flLO\"'Cov) unveils itself as the rp\u2022)aLc;\u00ad\ncharacter of these beings. To be sure, Aristotle does not show this directly \nbut rather in a way that clarifies the concept opposed to !Joprp\u0017, a concept \nthat has gone unexplained until now: VA7J. We do not say, \"That is \u2022puaLc;\" \nwhen there are only flesh and bones lying around. They are to a living entity \nwhat wood is to a bedstead: mere \"matter.\" Then does UAlj mean \"matter\"? \nBut let us ask again: What does \"matter\" mean? Does it mean just \"raw \nmaterial\"? No, Aristotle characterizes i)J.r, as \"'Co 8\u2022Jvlifl\u00a3L. \u0518uvaflLc; means \nthe capacity, or better, the appropriateness for . . .  The wood present in the \nworkshop [35 1] is in a state of appropriateness for a \"table.\" But it is not just \nany wood that has the character of appropriateness for a table; rather, only \nthis wood, selected and cut to order. But the selection and the cut, i.e., the \nvery character of appropriateness, is decided in terms of the \"production\" \nof\"what is to be produced.\" But \"to produce\" means, both in Greek and in \nthe original sense of the German Herste/Jen, to place something, as finished \nand as looking thus and so, forth, into presencing. \u00b7\u00b7y,_lj is the appropriate \norderable, that which, like flesh and bones, belongs to a being that has in \nitself the origin and ordering of its movedness.
