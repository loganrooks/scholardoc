As thus posited for itself, \nit is time:xxm \nIf space gets represented-that is, if it gets intuited immediately in the \nindifferent subsistence of its differences-then the negations are, as it were, \nsimply given. But by such a representation, space does not get grasped in \nits Being. Only in thinking is it possible for this to be done-in thinking as \nthe synthesis which has gone through thesis and antithesis and transmuted \nthem. Only if the negations do not simply remain subsisting in their \nindifference but get transmuted-that is, only if they themselves get \nnegated--does space get thought and thus grasped in its Being. In the \nnegation of the negation (that is, of punctuality) the point posits itself \nfor itself and thus emerges from the indifference of subsisting. As that which \nis posited for itself, it differentiates itself from this one and from that one : \nit is no longer this and not yet that. In positing itself for itself, it posits the \nsuccession in which it stands-the sphere of Being-outside-of-itself, which \nis by now the sphere of the negated negation. When punctuality as \nindifference gets transmuted, this signifies that it no longer remains lying \nin the 'paralysed tranquillity of space'. The point 'gives itself airs' before \nall the other points. 1 According to Hegel, this negation of the negation \nas punctuality is time. If this discussion has any demonstrable meaning, \nit can mean nothing else than that the positing-of-itself-for-itself of every \npoint is a \"now-here\", \"now-here\", and so on. Every point 'is' posited \nfor itself as a now-point. 'In time the point thus has actuality.' That \nthrough which each point, as this one here, can posit itself for itself, is in \neach case a \"now\". The \"now\" is the condition for the possibility of the \npoint's positing itself for itself. This possibility-condition makes up th< \nBeing of the point, and Being is the same as having been thought. Thus \nin each case the pure thinking of punctuality-that is, of space-'thinks' \nthe \"now\" and the Being-outside-of-itself of the \"now\" ; because of this, \nspace 'is' time. How is time itself defined ? \n'Time, as the negative unity of Being-outside-of-itself, is likewise some\u00ad\nthing simply abstract, ideal. It is that Being which, in that it is, is not, and \nwhich, in that it is not, is : it is intuited becoming. \nThis means that \nthose differences which, to be sure, are simply momentary, transmuting \nthemselves immediately, are defined as external, yet as external to them-\n43 1 \nselves.'xxiv For this interpretation, time reveals itself as 'intuited becom\u00ad\ning'. According t\" Hegel this signifies a transition from Being to nothing \nor from nothing to Being.xxv Becoming is both arising and passing away. \n1 'Der Punkt \"spreizt sich auf\" gegenuber allen anderen Punkten.' The verb 'spreizen' \nmeans 'to spread apart' ; but when used reflexively, as here, it takes on the more specific \nconnotation of swaggering, giving oneself airs. \n"

Every \"now\", \nhowever, either 'now' is-no-longer, or now is-not-yet; so it can be taken also \nas not-Being.1 Time is 'intuited' becoming-that is to say, it is the transition \nwhich does not get thought but which simply tenders itself in the sequence \nof \"nows\". If the essence of time is defined as 'intuited becoming', then it \nbecomes manifest that time is primarily understood in terms of the \n\"now\", and indeed in the very manner in which one comes across such a \n\"now\" in pure intuition. \nNo detailed discussion is needed to make plain that in Hegel's Inter\u00ad\npretation of time he is moving wholly in' the direction of the way time is \nordinarily understood. When he characterizes time in terms of the \"now\", \nthis presupposes that in its full structure the \"now\" remains levelled off \nand covered up, so that it can be intuited as something present-at-hand, \nthough present-at-hand only 'ideally'. \nThat Hegel Interprets time in terms of this primary orientation by the \n\"now\" which has been levelled off, is evidenced by the following \nsentences : 'The \"now\" is monstrously privileged: it 'is' nothing but the \nindividual \"now\" ; but in giving itself airs, this thing which is so exclusive \nhas already been dissolved, diffused, and pulverized, even while I am \nexpressing it.'xxvi 'In Nature, moreover, where time is now, no \"stable\" \n[\"bestehend\"] difference between these dimensions' (past and future) \n'ever comes about' .xxvu 'Thus in a positive sense one can say of time that \nonly the Present is; the \"before\" and \"after\" are not ; but the concrete \nPresent is the result of the past and is pregnant with the future. Thus the \ntrue Present is eternity.'xxvm \nIf Hegel calls time 'intuited becoming', then neither arising nor passing \naway has any priority in time. Nevertheless, on occasion he characterizes \ntime as the 'abstraction of consuming' [\"Abstraktion des Verzehrens\"]\u00ad\nthe most radical formula for the way in which time is ordinarily experi\u00ad\nenced and interpreted.xxlx On the other hand, when Hegel really defines \n\"time\", he is consistent enough to grant no such priority to consuming \nand passing away as that which the everyday way of experiencing time \n432 \nrightly adheres to; for Hegel can no more provide dialectical grounds for \nsuch a priority than he can for the 'circumstance' (which he has intro\u00ad\nduced as self-evident) that the \"now\" turns up precisely in the way the \npoint posits itself for itself. So even when he characterizes time as \"be\u00ad\ncorning\", Hegel understands this \"becoming\" in an 'abstract' sense, \nwhich goes well beyond the representation of the 'stream' of time. Thus \n1 'Das Sein der Zeit ist dasjetzt; sofem aber jedes Jetzt \"jetzt\" auch schon nicht-mehr\u00ad\nbzw. je jetzt zuvor noch-nicht-ist, kann es auch als Nichtsein gefast werden.' \n"

Here the sequence of \"nows\" has been formalized in the \nmost extreme sense and levelled off in such a way that one can hardly go \nany farther.xx Only from the standpoint of this formal-dialectical con\u00ad\nception of time can Hegel produce any connection between time and \nspirit. \n433 \n(b) Hegel's Interpretation of the Connection between Time and Spirit \nIf Hegel can say that when spirit gets actualized, it accords with it to \nfall into time, with \"time\" defined as a negation of a negation, how has \nspirit itself been understood ? The essence of spirit is the concept. By this \nHegel understands not the universal which is intuited in a genus as the \nform of something thought, but rather the form of the very thinking which \nthinks itself: the conceiving of oneself-as the grasping of the not-I. Inasmuch \nas the grasping of the not-I presents a differentiation, there lies in the pure \nconcept, as the grasping of this differentiation, a differentiation of the \ndifference. Thus Hegel can define the essence of the spirit formally and \napophantically as the negation of a negation. This 'absolute negativity' \ngives a logically formalized Interpretation of Descartes' \"cogito me cogitare \nrem\", wherein he sees the essence of the conscientia. \nThe concept is accordingly a self-conceiving way in which the Self has \nbeen conceived ; as thus conceived, the Self is authentically as it can be\u00ad\nthat isfree.1 'The \"I\" is the pure concept itself, which as concept has come \ninto Dasein.'xxl 'The \"I\", however, is this initialf:y pure unity which relates \nitself to itself-not immediately, but in that it abstracts from all deter-\n434 \nminateness and content, and goes back to the freedom of its unrestricted \nself-equality.'xxll Thus the \"I\" is 'universaliry', but it is 'individuality' 2  \njust as immediately. \nThis negating of the negation is both that which is 'absolutely restless' \nin the spirit and also its self-manifestation, which belongs to its essence. The \n'progression' of the spirit which actualizes itself in history, carries with it \n'a principle of exclusion'.xx111 In this exclusion, however, that which is \nexcluded does not get detached from the spirit ; it gets surmounted. The kind \n1 'Der Begriff ist sonach die sich begreifende Begriffenheit des Selbst, als welche das \nSelbst eigentlich ist, wie es sein kann, das heisstfrei.' The noun 'Begriffenheit' is of course \nderived from 'begriffen', the past participle of 'begreifen' ('to conceive' or 'to grasp'). \n'Begriffen', however, may also be used when we would say that someone is 'in the process \nof' doing something. This would suggest the alternative translation : 'The concept is \naccordingly a self-conceiving activity of the Self-an activity of such a nature that when \nthe Self performs it, it is authentically as it can be--namely,free.' \n2 '  \"Einzelheit\" '. We take this reading from Lasson's edition of Hegel, which Heidegger \ncites. The older editions of Heidegger's work have 'Einzelnheit' ; the newer ones have \n'Einzenheit'. Presumably these are both misprints. \n"

For 'time is \nthe concept itself, which is there [ da ist] and which represents itself to the \nconsciousness as an empty intuition; because of this, spirit necessarily \nappears in time, and it appears in time as long as it does not grasp its pure \nconcept-that is, as long as time is not annulled by it.

But the very fact that a formal\u00ad\ndialectical 'construction' of this connection can be ventured at all, makes \nmanifest that these are primordially akin. Hegel's 'construction' was \nprompted by his arduous struggle to conceive the 'concretion' of the spirit. \nHe makes this known in the following sentence from the concluding \nchapter of his Phenomenology of the Spirit: 'Thus time appears as the very \nfate and necessity which spirit has when it is not in itself complete : the \nnecessity of its giving self-consciousness a richer share in consciousness, of \nits setting in motion the immediacy of the \"in-itself\" (the form in which \nsubstance is in consciousness) , or, conversely, of its realizing and making \nmanifest the \"in-itself\" taken as the inward (and this is what first is inward) \n-that is, of vindicating it for its certainty of itself.'xl \nOur existential analytic of Dasein, on the contrary, starts with the \n'concretion' of factically thrown existence itself in order to unveil tem-\n436 \nporality as that which primordially makes such existence possible.

The Existential-temporal Anarytic of Dasein, and the Question of Funda\u00ad\nmental Ontology as to the Meaning .of Being in General \nIn our considerations hitherto, our task has been to Interpret the \nprimordial whole of factical Dasein with regard to its possibilities of authentic \nand inauthentic existing, and to do so in an existential-ontological manner \nin terms of its very basis. Temporality has manifested itself as this basis and \naccordingly as the meaning of the Being of care. So that which our \npreparatory existential analytic of Dasein contributed before temporality \nwas laid bare, has now been taken back into temporality as the primordial \nstructure of Dasein's totality of Being. In terms of the possible ways in \nwhich primordial time can temporalize itself, we have provided the \n1 'Der \"Geist\" fallt nicht in die Zeit, sondem: die faktische Existenz \"fallt\" als ver\u00ad\nfallende aus der urspriinglichen, eigentlichen Zeitlichkeit.'

The thematic analytic of existence, however, \nfirst needs the light of the idea of Being in general, which must be clarified \nbeforehand. This holds particularly if we adhere to the principle which we \nexpressed in our introduction as one by which any philosophical investiga\u00ad\ntion may be gauged : that philosophy \"is universal phenomenological \nontology, and takes its departure from the hermeneutic of Dasein, which, \nas an analytic of existence, has made fast the guiding-line for all philo\u00ad\nsophical inquiry at the point where it arises and to which it returns.\"xll \nThis thesis, of course, is to be regarded not as a dogma, but rather as a \nformulation of a problem of principle which still remains 'veiled' : can \none provide ontological grounds for ontology, or does it also require an \nontical foundation ? and which entity must take over the function of pro\u00ad\nviding this foundation ? \nThe distinction between the Being of existing Dasein and the Being of \nentities, such as Reality, which do not have the character of Dasein, may \nappear very illuminating ; but it is still only the point of departure for the \n437 \nontological problematic ; it is nothing with which philosophy may tranquil-\nlize itself.

Why does this reifying always \nkeep coming back to exercise its dominion ? What positive structure does \nthe Being of 'consciousness' have, if reification remains inappropriate to \nit ? Is the 'distinction' between 'consciousness' and 'Thing' sufficient for \ntackling the ontological problematic in a primordial manner ? Do the \nanswers to these questions lie along our way ?

Whether this is the onry way or even \nthe right one at all, can be decided only after one has gone along it. The \nconflict as to the Interpretation of Being cannot be allayed, because it has \nnot yet been enkindled.

Husserl \nbegins witli tlie words: 'Altliough Diltliey grasped tlie problems which point tlie way, \nand saw tlie directions which tlie work to be done would have to take, he still failed to \npenetrate to any decisive formulations of tliese problems, or to any solutions of tliem \nwhich are metliodologically correct.' Husser! has studied tliese problems still more \ndeeply since this first treatment of them ; essential portions of his work have been \ncommunicated in his Freiburg lectures. \n"

(H. 50) But to disclose the a priori is not to make an 'a-prioristic' construction. Edmund \nHusser! has not only enabled us to understand once more the meaning of any genuine \nphilosophical empiricism; he has also given us the necesary tools. 'A-priorism' is the \nmethod of every scientific philosophy which understands itself. There is nothing \nconstructivistic about it. But for this very reason a priori research requires that the \nphenomenal basis be properly prepared. The horizon which is closest to us, and which \nmust be made ready for the analytic of Dasein, lies in its average everydayness. \nxi. (H. 51) Ernst Casirer has recently made the Dasein of myth a theme for philosophical \nInterpretation. (See his Philosophie der symholischen Formen, vol. II, Das mythisclu Denken, \nIg25.) In this study, clues of far-reaching importance are made available for ethno\u00ad\nlogical research. From the standpoint of philosophical problematics it remains an open \nquestion whether the foundations of this Interpretation are sufficiently transparent\u00ad\nwhether in particular the architectonics and the general systematic content of Kant's \nCritique of Pure &ason can provide a possible design for such a task, or whether a new \nand more primordial approach may not here be needed. That Casirer hi\u0106nself sees the \npossibility of such a task is shown by his note on pp. 16 ff., where he alludes to the \nphenomenological horizons disclosed by Husser!. In a discussion between the author and \nCassirer on the occasion of a lecture before the Hamburg section of the Kantgesellschaft \nin December 1g23 on 'Tasks and Pathways of Phenomenological Research', it was \nalready apparent that we agreed in demanding an existential analytic such as was \nsketched in that lecture. \nDivision One, Chapter Two \ni.

(H. 190) It is no accident that the phenomena of anxiety and fear, which have never \nbeen distinguished in a thoroughgoing manner, have come within the purview of \nChristian theology ontically and even (though within very narrow limits) ontologically. \nThis has happened whenever the anthropological problem of man's Being towards \nGod has won priority and when questions have been formulated under the guidance \nof phenomena like faith, sin, love, and repentance. Cf. Augustine's doctrine of the timor \ncastus and servilis, which is discussed in his exegetical writings and his letters. On fear in \ngeneral cf. his De diversis quaestionibus octoginta tribus, qu. 33 (de metu) ; qu. 34 (utrum non \naliud amandum sit, quam metu carere) ; qu. 35 (quid amandum sit). (Migne, Patrologiae Latinae \ntom. VII, pp. 23 ff.) \nLuther has treated the problem of fear not only in the traditional context of an \nInterpretation of poenitentia and contritio, but also in his commentary on the Book of \nGenesis, where, though his treatment is by no means highly conceptualized, it is all the \nmo\u00d7e impressive as edification. Cf. Enarrationes in genesin, cap. g, Werke (Erlanger \nAusgabe), Exegetica opera latina, tom. I, pp. 177 ff. \nThe man who has gone farthest in analysing the phenomenon of anxiety-and again in \nthe theological context of a 'psychological' exposition of the problem of original sin-is \nSeren Kierkegaard. Cf. Der Begriff tier Angst [17le Concept of Dread], 1844, Gesammelte \nWerke (Diederichs), vol. 5\u00b7 \nv. (H. 197) The author ran across the following pre-ontological illustration of the \nexistential-ontological Interpretation of Dasein as care in K. Burdach's article. 'Faust \nund die Sorge' (Deutsche Vierteljahrschrift fiir Littraturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte, \nvol. I, 1923, pp. 1 ff.). Burdach has shown that the fable ofCura (which has come down \nto us as No. 220 of the Fables of Hyginus) was taken over from Herder by Goethe and \nworked up for the second part of his Faust. cr. especially pp. 40 ff. The text given \nabove is taken from F. Biicheler (Rheinisches Museum, vol. 41, 1886, p. 5) ; the translation \nis from Burdach, ibid., pp. 41 ff. \nvi. (H. 198) cr. Herder's poem: 'Das Kind der Sorge' (Suphan XXIX, 75). \nvi. (H. 199) Burdach, op. cit., p. 49\u00b7 Even as early as the Stoics, 1-'lP\u2022I-'va. was a firmly \nestablished term, and it recurs in the New Testament, becoming \"sollicitudo\" in the \nVulgate. The way in which 'care' is viewed in the foregoing existential analytic of \nDasein, is one which has grown upon the author in connection with his attempts to \nInterpret the Augustinian (i.e., Helleno-Christian) anthropology with regard to the \nfoundational principles reached in the ontology of Aristotle. \n"

(Ibid., p. go.) \nxvi. (H. 208) Following Scheler's procedure, Nicolai Hartmann has recently based his \nontologically oriented epistemology upon the thesis that knowing is a 'relationship of \nBeing'. Cf. his Grundziige einer Metaphysik der Erkenntnis, second enlarged edition, 1g25. \nBoth Scheler and Hartman, however, in spite of all the differences in the phenomeno\u00ad\nlogical bases from which they start, fail to recognize that in its traditional basic orienta\u00ad\ntion as regards Dasein, 'ontology' has been a failure, and that the very 'relationship of \nBeing' which knowing includes (see above, H. 59 ff.), compels such 'ontology' to be \nrevised in its principles, not just critically corrected. Because Hartmann underestimates \nthe unexpressed consequences of positing a relationship-of-Being without providing an \nontological clarification for it, he is forced into a 'critical realism' which is at bottom \nquite foreign to the level of the problematic he has expounded. On Hartman's way of \ntaking ontology, cf. his 'Wie ist kritische Ontologie iiberhaupt moglich ?', Festschrift \nfiir Paul Natorp, 1g24, pp. 124 ff. \nxvii.

But the existential problematic was so alien to him that, as regards his ontology, \nhe remained completely dominated by Hegel and by ancient philosophy as Hegel saw \nit.l Thus, there is more to be learned philosophically from his 'edifying' writings than \nfrom his theoretical ones-with the exception of his treatise on the concept of anxiety. \n[Here Heidegger is referring to the work generally known in English as The Concept \nof Dread.-Tr.] \nDivision Two, Chapter One \ni.

Stoker underestimates from the outset the hermeneutical con\u00ad\nditions for a 'description' of 'conscience as something which subsists Objectively and \nactually' (p. 3).

The line taken in the essay \ngoes beyond giving a mere historiological report, and is aimed towards the 'cate\u00ad\ngorial' problem of personality. \nHeimsoeth says: 'Too little note has been taken of the intimate way in which the \ntheoretical and the practical reason are worked into one another in Kant's practice and \nplanning; too little heed has been given to the fact that even here the categories (as \nopposed to the way in which they are filled in naturalistically in the 'principles') \nexplicitly retain their validity and, under the primacy of the practical reason, are to \nfind a new application detached from naturalistic rationalism (substance, for instance, \nin the 'person' and personal immortality; causality as the 'causality of freedom' ; and \nreciprocity in the 'community of rational creatures' ; and so forth). They serve as \nintellectual fixatives for a new way of access to the unconditioned, without seeking to \ngive any ratiocinative knowledge of it as an object.' (pp. 31 f.) \nBut here the real ontological problem has been passed over. We cannot leave aside the \nquestion of whether these 'categories' can retain their primordial validity and only \nneed to be applied in another way, or whether they do not rather pervert the ontological \nproblematics of Dasein from the ground up. Even if the theoretical reason has been \nbuilt into the practical, the existential-ontological problem of the Self remains not \nmerely unsolved ; it has not even been raisld. On what ontological basis is the 'working \ninto one another' of the theoretical and the practical reason to be performed ? Is it \ntheoretical or practical behaviour that determines the kind of Being of a person, or \nneither of them-and if neither, then what is it? In spite of their fundamental signifi\u00ad\ncance, do not the paralogisms make manifest how ontologically groundless are the \nproblema tics of the Self from Descartes' ru cogitans right up to Hegel's concept of spirit? \nOne does not need to think either 'naturalistically' or 'rationalistically', and yet one \nmay be under the domination of the ontology of the 'substantial'-a domination which \nis only more baleful because it is seemingly self-evident. \nSee what is essentially a supplement to the above-mentioned essay: Heimsoeth, 'Die \nmetaphysischen Motive in der Ausbildung des Kritischen Idealismus', Kantstudien, \nXXIX, (1924), pp. 121 ff.

If the ontological foundations of such measurement are to be \nclarified, this presupposes that world-time and within-time-ness have already been \nclarified in terms of Dasein's temporality, and that light has also been cast on the \nexistential-temporal Constitution of the discovery of Nature and the temporal meaning \nof measurement. Any axiomatic for the physical technique of measurement must rest \nupon such investigations, and can never, for its own part, tackle the problem of time \nas such. \nv.

The con\u00ad\nnections between historical numeration, world-time as calculated astronomically, and \nthe temporality and historicality of Dasein need a more extensive investigation. \nCf. further G.

If God's eternity can be 'construed' \nphilosophically, then it may be understood only as a more primordial temporality \nwhich is 'infinite'.

[The pasage from Hegel reads as follows : \n'Time is not, as it were, a receptacle in which everything has been put in a stream, and \nfrom which it gets swept away and swept under. Time is only this abstraction of such \ncor.suming.'-Tr.J \nxx. (H. 432-433) The priority which Hegel has given to the \"now\" which has been \nlevelled off, makes it plain that in defining the concept of time he is under the sway of \nthe manner in which time is ordinarily understood; and this means that he is likewise \nunder the sway of the traditional conception of it. It can even be shown that his con\u00ad\nception of time has been drawn directly from the 'physics' of Aristotle. \nIn the Jena Logic (Cf. G. Lasson's 1923 edition), which was projected at the time of \nHegel's habilitation, the analysis of time which we find in his Encyclopedia has already \nbeen developed in all its essential parts. Even the roughest examination reveals that the \nsection on time (pp. 202 ff.) is a paraphrase of Aristotle's esay on time. In the Jena LogU; \nHegel has already developed his view of time within the framework of his philosophy of \nNature (p. 186), the first part of which is entitled 'System of the Sun' (p. 195). Hegel \ndiscusses the concept of time in conjunction with defining the concepts of aether and \nmotion. Here too his analysis of space comes later. Though the dialectic already emerges, \nit does not have as yet the rigid schematic form which it will have afterward, but still \nmakes it possible to understand the phenomena in a fairly relaxed manner. On the way \nfrom Kant to Hegel's developed system, the impact of the Aristotelian ontology and \nlogic has again been decisive. The Fact of this impact has long been well known. But \nthe kind of effect it has had, the path it has taken, even its limitations, have hitherto \nbeen as obscure as the Fact itself has been familiar. A concrete philosophical Interpretation \ncomparing Hegel's Jena Logic with the 'physics' and 'metaphysics' of Aristotle will \nbring new light. For the above considerations, some rough suggestions will suffice. \nAristotle sees the essence of time in the vvv, Hegel in the \"now\". Aristotle takes the \nvvv as opos ; Hegel takes the \"now\" as a 'boundary'. Aristotle understands the viv \nas a-r\u2022'YI\"\u00d6 ; Hegel interprets the \"now\" as a point. Aristotle describes the vOv as -roll- .,, ; \nHegel calls the \"now\" the 'absolute this' Aristotle follows tradition in connecting \nxpovos with the a\u00a2>a'ipa; Hegel stresses the 'circular course' of time. To be sure, Hegel \nescapes the central tendency of the Aristotelian analysis-the tendency to expose a \nfoundational connection (dKo.\\ovll.'iv) between the vvv, the opos, the UT''l'l\"\u00d7\u2022 and the \nTOii\u20ac \"''\u00b7 \nIn its results, Bergson's view is in accord with Hegel's thesis that space 'is' time, in \nspite of the very different reasons they have given. Bergson merely says the reverse : that \ntime (temps) is space. Bergson's view of time too has obviously arisen from an Inter\u00ad\npretation of the Ari<totelian essay on time.
