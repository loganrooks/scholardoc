      "full_text": "The Ellipsis of the Sun\ncomposition, on the basis of meaning and reference, that the human voice should\nbe distinguished from the call of an animal. Meaning and reference: that is, the\npossibility of signifying by means of a noun. What is proper to nouns is to\nsignify something (Ta de onornata s\u00ebmainei ti; Rhetoric III, 10, 1410b11), an inde-\npendent being identical to itself, conceived as such. It is at this point that the\ntheory of the name, such as it is implied by the concept of metaphor, is articulated\nwith ontology. Aside from the classical and dogmatically affirmed limit between\nthe animal without logos and man as the z\u00f6on logon ekhon, what appears here is\na certain systematic indissociability of the value of metaphor and the meta-\nphysical chain holding together the values of discourse, voice, noun, signifi-\ncation, meaning, imitative representation, resemblance; or, in order to reduce\nwhat these translations import or deport, the values of logos, phOne semantik\u00eb,\ns\u00ebmainein, onoma, mimisis, homoiosis. The definition of metaphor is in its place\nin the Poetics, which opens as a treatise on mim\u00ebsis. Mimesis is never without the\ntheoretical perception of resemblance or similarity, that is, of that which always\nwill be posited as the condition for metaphor. Homoiosis is not only constitutive\nof the value of truth (al\u00ebtheia) which governs the entire chain; it is that without\nwhich the metaphorical operation is impossible: \"To produce a good metaphor\nis to see a likeness\" (To gar eu metapherein to to homoion theOrem\nestin. 1459a7\u20148).\nThe condition for metaphor (for good and true metaphor) is the condition for\ntruth. Therefore it is to be expected that the animal, deprived of logos, of phone\ns\u00ebmanfik\u00eb, of stoikheion, etc., also would be incapable of mimesis. Mimesis thus\ndetermined belongs to logos, and is not animalistic aping, or gesticular mimicry;\nit is tied to the possibility of meaning and truth in discourse. At the beginning\nof the Poetics mim\u00ebsis in a way is posited as a possibility proper to physis. Physis\nis revealed in mimesis, or in the poetry which is a species of mirn\u00easis, by virtue\nof the hardly apparent structure which constrains mim\u00ebsis from carrying to the\nexterior the fold of its redoubling. It belongs to physis, or, if you will, physis\nincludes its own exteriority and its double. In this sense, mim\u00ebsis is therefore a\n\"natural\" movement. This naturality is reduced and restricted to man's speech\nby Aristotle. But rather than a reduction, this constitutive gesture of metaphysics\nand of humanism is a teleological determination: naturality in general says itself,\nreassembles itself, knows itself, appears to itself, reflects itself, and \"mimics\"\nitself par excellence and in truth in human nature. M\u00fcn\u00ebsis is proper to man.\nOnly man imitates properly. Man alone takes pleasure in imitating, man alone\nlearns to imitate, man alone learns by imitation. The power of truth, as the\nunveiling of nature (physis) by mim\u00ebsis, congenitally belongs to the physics of\nman, to anthropophysics. Such is the natural origin of poetry, and such is the\nnatural origin of metaphor: \"It is clear that the general origin of poetry was due\nto two causes, each of them part of human nature (physikai). Imitation is natural\n(symphyton: innate, congenital) to man from childhood, one of his advantages\nover the lower animals being this, that he is the most imitative creature\n(mirnCtik\u00f4taton) in the world and learns at first (math\u00ebseis protas: first knowledge)\n237\n"

And it is also natural for all to delight in works of imitation\" (Poetics,\n14481,4\u20149).\nAs these two sources of poetry confirm, logos, rnimisis, and al\u00ebtheia here are\none and the samepossibility. And logos is in its element only in phone. It belongs\nthere better than elsewhere. And this is always so according to a teleological\ndetermination: just as the destination of nature is to be mimed best in human\nnature, and just as man, more than any other animal, properly imitates (mi-\nmetikOtaton), so the voice is the organ most apt to imitate. This vocation of the\nvoice is designated by the same word (mimetikOtaton) in book 3 of the Rhetoric:\n\".\n. . words (onomata) are imitations (mim\u00ebmata), and .\n. . the human voice.\nof all organs can\nbest imitate things (he phone pantOn mim\u00ebtikotaton tOn moriOn\"\n[III, I, 1404a21\u201422; translation modified]).\nfrietaphor thus,\neffect of mimesis and homoiosis, the manifestation of\nanalogy, will be a means of knowledge, a means that is subordinate, but certain.\nOne may say of it what is said of poetry: it is more philosophical and more\nserious (philosophoteron kai spoudaioteron)\n(Poetics 1451b5.\u20146), since it\nrecounts not only the particular, but also states the general, the probable and\nthe necessary.4' However, it is not as serious as philosophy itself, and apparently\nwill conserve this intermediary status throughout the history of philosophy. Or\nrather, its ancillary status: metaphor, when well trained, must work in the service\nof truth, but the master is not to content himself with this, and must prefer the\ndiscourse of full truth to metaphor. For example, Aristotle reproaches Plato for\nbeing satisfied with \"poetic metaphors\" (metaphoras legein poietikas) and for keep-\ning to hollow language (kenologein) when he says that Ideas are the paradigms\nin which other things participate\nA9, 991a20, M5, 1079b25).\nFor the same reason, pleasure, the second \"cause\" of mim\u00ebsis and metaphor,\nis the pleasure of knowing, of learning by resemblance, of recognizing the same.\nThe philosopher will be more apt at this than anyone else. He will be man par\nexcellence: \"The explanation is to be found in a further fact: to be learning,\nsomething is the greatest of pleasures, not only to the philosopher, but to the\nrest of mankind, however small their capacity for it\u2014the reason of the delight\nin seeing the picture (eikonas) is that one is at the same time learning, and\ndeducing (syllogizesthai) what is represented\" (Poetics, 1448b12\u201417). Book 3 of the\nRhetoric specifies this idea, between a stalk and a flower: \"We all naturally (physei)\nfind it agreeable to get hold of new ideas easily: words (onomata) signify some-\nthing (s\u00ebmainei ti), and therefore those words are the most agreeable which bring\nus knowledge of something new. . . From metaphor. . . we can best get hold\nof something fresh. When the poet calls old age a 'withered stalk' (kalam\u00ebn) he\nconveys a new idea, a new fact, to us by means of the general notion of 'lost\n41. \"Metaphors must be drawn, as has been said already, from things that are related\nto the original thing, and yet not obviously so related (apo oikeiOn kei me phanerOn)\u2014just\nas in philosophy also an acute mind will perceive resemblances (to homoion .\ntheorem)\neven in things far apart\" (Rhetoric lii, ii, 1412a9\u201412).\n238\n"

The\nlimit does not divide the human from the animal. Another division furrows the\nentirety of \"human\" language. This latter division is not homogenous, is not\nhuman in all its aspects, and to the same degree. The noun still remains the\ndetermining criterion: included in the literal elements, the asemantic vocal\nemissions, are not only letters themselves. The syllable belongs to lexis, but of\ncourse has no meaning in itself. Above all, there are whole \"words\" which play\nan indispensable role in the organization of discourse, but still remain, from\nAristotle's point of view, totally without meaning. The conjunction\nis a phone as\u00ebmos. This holds equally for the article, for articulation in general\n(art hron), and for everything that functions between signifying members, between\nnouns, substantives, or verbs (Poetics 1456b38\u20141457a10). Articulation has no\nmeaning because it makes no reference by means of a categoremic unity, to an\nindependent unity, the unity of a substance or\nThus, it is excluded from\nthe metaphorical field as the onornastic field. Henceforth, the annagrammatical,\nseparately (choris) in the treatise on the Art of Poetry\" (Rhetoric 1, ii, 1371b4\u20141373a1).\nAccording to the elliptical syllogism of mim\u00ebsis, the pleasure of knowing always accom-\nmodates itself to the marking absence of its object. It is even born of this accommodation.\nThe n\u00fcmeme is neither the thing itself nor something totally other. Nothing will upset the\nlaw of this pleasure according to the economy of the same and of difference, not even\u2014\nespecially not\u2014the horror, ugliness, and unbearable obscenity of the imitated thing, as\nsoon as it remains out of sight and out of reach, off stage. We would have to follow the\nchain of examples which have obsessed this classical topos, from Aristotle to Lessing. As\nalways, when the mimetic ellipsis is in play, Oedipus, the serpent, and parricide are not\nfar off. \"Though the objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight to view the\nmost realistic representations of them in. art, the forms for example of the lowest animals\nand of dead bodies. . . the reason of the delight in seeing the picture is that one is at the\nsame time learning and deducing (manthanein kni syllogizesthai) what is represented, for\ninstance, that this figure is such and such a person\" (Poetics 1448b10\u201417). \"II n'est point\nde serpent ni de monstre odieux I Qui par l'art imit\u00e9, ne puisse plaire aux yeux: / D'un\npinceau d\u00e9licat l'artifice agr\u00e9able / Du plus affreux objet fait un objet aimable. / Ainsi pour\nnous charmer, La Tragedie en pleurs I D'Oedipe tout sanglant fit parler des douleurs I\nD'Oreste parricide exprima les alarmes, / Et, pour nous divertir, nous arracha des larmes.\"\nBoileau, Art Poetique, Chant 11, 1-S. l\"There is no serpent or odious monster / That imitated\nby art cannot be pleasing to our eyes: /With a delicate brush agreeable artifice / Makes of\nthe most frightful object a pleasing one. / Thus, for our pleasure, the tearful Tragedy I Of\nOedipus, all bloody, spoke of sorrows / And of parricide Orestes sounded the alarum, /\nAnd, for our diversion, wrenched from us our tears.\" I Euripides' Orestes wished no longer\nto see in his dreams a head bristling with snakes. Longinus cited and commented on the\nlines of this scene; Boileau translated them. Within the same space, the same system, one\ncan also refuse the unbearable pleasure of such a representation. From La poEt ique by Jules\nde Ia Mesnardi\u00e8re (1639): \"Beautiful descriptions are certainly agreeable. . . But whatever\npowerful attractions these marvelous paintings might have, they should represent only\nthings that are pleasant or at least bearable. A fine palette is to be employed for subjects\nthat are not odious, and one should not work like those bizarre painters who put their\nentire science in the portrayal of a snake or some horrid reptile.\"\n44. The Rhetoric also treats the good usage of the conjunction (III, v) and the effects of\nthe asyndeton, the suppression of the conjunction (Ill, xu).\n240\n"

If this analogy imposes itself\u2014and\nit does\u2014then it is that within language the analogy itself is due to a long and\nhardly visible chain whose first link is quite difficult to exhibit, and not only for\nAristotle. Rather than a metaphor, do we not have here an \"enigma,\" a secret\nnarrative, composed of several metaphors, a powerful asyndeton or dissimulated\nconjunction, whose essential characteristic is \"to describe a fact in an impossible\ncombination of words\" (ainigmatos te gar idea haute esti, to legonfa huparkhonta\nadunata sunapsai')\" (Poetics, 1458a26\u201427)?\nIf every metaphor is an elliptical comparison or analogy, in this case we are\ndealing with a metaphor par excellence, a metaphorical redoubling, an ellipsis\nellipsis. But the missing term calls for a noun which names something prop-\nerly. The present terms (the sun, the rays, the act of sowing, the seed) are not\nin themselves, according to Aristotle, tropes. Here, the metaphor consists in a\nsubstitution of proper names having a fixed meaning and referent, especially\nwhen we are dealing with the sun whose referent has the originality of always\nbeing original, unique, and irreplaceable, at least in the representation we give\nof it. There\nis the\nnonmetaphorical p!ime mover of metaphor, the father of all figures. Everything\nturns around it, everything turns toward it.\nAnd yet, in one sentence, in a parenthesis that is immediately closed, Aristotle\nincidentally invokes the case of a lexis that would be metaphorical in all its\naspects. Or at least no proper name is present in it, is apparent as such. Im-\nmediately after the solar sowing, here is the \"wineless cup\": \"There is\nanother form of qualified metaphor. Having given the thing the alien name, one\nmay by a negative addition deny of it one of the attributes naturally associated\n-'\nwith its new name. An instance of this would be to call the shield not 'the cup\nof Ares' as in the former case, but 'a cup that holds no wine' \" (1457b30\u201433).\nBut this pzocedure can b&.pursued and complicated infinitely, although Ar-\nistotle dQesnoLsay so. No reference properly being named in such a metaphor,\nthe figure is carried off into the adventure of a long, implicit sentence, a secret\nnarrative which nothing assures us will lead us back to the proper name. The\nmetaphorization of metaphor, its bottomless overdeterminability, seems to be\ninscribed in the structure of metaphor, but as its negativity. As soon as one\nadmits that all the terms in an analogical relation already are caught up, one by\none, in a metaphorical relation,\nbegins to function no longer as a/\nsun, but as a star, the punctual source of truth or properness remaining invisible\n243\n"

This no\nlonger holds for the significations kurion and idion, which are both generally\ntranslated by the same word: proper.52 Althougfithe difference between kurion\nand idion is never given thematic exposition, it seems that kurion, more frequent\nin both the Poetics and the Rhetoric, designates\nin its dominant, master,\nLet us not forget that this sense of sov-\nereignty is also the tutelary sense of kurion. By extension, kurion is interpreted\nas theprimitive (as opposed to\nand sometimes is used as the\nequivalent of the usual, literal, familiar sense (to de kurion kai to oikeion [Rhetoric,\nIII, II, 1404b6]): \"By the ordinary word (kurion) I mean that in general use in a\ncountry\" (Poetics 1457b3\u20144). Kurion is then distinguished, on the one hand, from\nthe unusual, rare, idiomatic word (glotta), and from metaphor, on the other. As\nfor idion, which is much rarer in this context, it seems to participate in the two\nother meanings. More precisely, in the Rhetoric (ifi, V. 1407a31) to employ the\nproper name is to avoid the detour of periphrasis (tois idiois onornasi legein, kai\nme tois periekhousin), which is the correct thing to do. The contamination of these\nthree values seems already accomplished in the Ciceronian notion of verba propria\nas opposed to verba translata (De oratore 2.4).\nHowever, the value of the idion seems to support this entire metaphorology,\nwithout occupying center stage. We know that in the Topics, for example, it is\nat the center of a theory of the proper, of essence, and of accident. Now, if\nmetaphor (or mim\u00ebsis in general) aims at an effect of cognition, it cannot be\ntreated without being placed in relation to a knowledge that bears on definitions:\non what the thing of which one speaks is, properly, essentially, or accidentally.\nCertainly one may speak properly or improperly of what is not proper to the\nthing, its accident, for example. Here, the two values properness/improperness\ndo not have the same locus of pertinence. Nevertheless, the ideal of every\nlanguage, and in particular of metaphor, being to bring to knowledge the thing\nitself, the turn of speech will be better if it brings us closer to the thing's essential\ntruth. The space of language, the field of its divisions, is opened\nprecisely by the difference between essence, the proper, and accident. Three\ntreference points, preliminarily.\n1. A noun is proper when it has but a single sense. Better, it is only in this\ncase that it is properly a noun. Univocity is the essence, or better, the telos of\nlanguage. No philosophy, as such, has ever renounced this Aristotelian ideal.\nThis ideal is philosophy. Aristotle recognizes that a word may have several\nmeanings. This is a fact.\nthis fact has right of entr\nonly jr\nthe extent to which the polysemia is finite, the different significations are limited\nin number, and above all sufficiently distinct, each remaining one and identifi-\n51.

As will be seen in the next few citations from Aristotle, kurion and idion are not\ntranslated into English by the same word (\"proper\"), although they are in French.

Which is to be expected since the code is forced, but strange because\nthe abuse is no more a form of usage than an application of the code: \"There\nis a Trope that we have accepted, like Du Marsais, but to which we have neither\nassigned a rank, nor devoted an article in our Theory: this is Catachresis. In effect,\nwe did not believe it necessary to treat this Trope more particularly, immediately\nthat, far from making it a species apart, as does Du Marsais, and not only a\n? species of Trope, but even of figure, we consider it only as the forced use, if not\nat least\nof one or the other of the three great species we\nhave afr\n(p. 213).\nIn the supplement, the longest elaborations are granted to ihe\nof\nmetaphor.

It remains that the interpretation of\nthe metaphor-catachreses of prepositions (to, for example) always consists in\ndefining its meaning by means of the name of categoremes (disposition, site or\nplace, time, posture, gesture, manner, animating cause, destination, etc.; cf. p.\n219), and even by means of a single nominal signification, the \"tendency,\" \"as\nCondillac has shown so well in his Grammar.\"\nAs for nouns and verbs, the examples given by Fontanier are initially\u2014and\nexclusively\u2014those of metaphor-catachreses whose philosophical burden is the\nheaviest (light, blindness; to have, to be, to do, to take, to understand).

But Tropes occur, either by\nnecessity and extension, in order to supplement the words for certain ideas which are\nmissing from language, or by choice and figure, in order to present ideas with more vivid\nand striking images than their own signs. Whence two different kinds of tropological sense:\nthe extended tropological sense and the figurative tropological sense. The first, as one can see,\nstands between the primitive sense and the figurative sense, and can hardly be regarded as\nanything but a new kind of proper sense\" (pp. 57\u201458). What is interesting to us here, thus,\n')) is the production of a proper sense, a new kind of proper sense, by means of the violence\nof a catachresis whose intermediary status tends to escape the opposition of the primitive\nand the figurative, standing between them as a \"middle.\" When the middle of an op-\nposition is not the passageway of a mediation, there is every chance that the opposition\nis not pertinent.

The work to be undertaken under the\nheading of such a meta-metaphorics would not be without interest. In sum, it\nwould amount to transporting into the philosophical order the Bachelardian\nprogram of a metapoetics (Lautr\u00e9amont, p. 55),M What would the limits of such\na transposition be?\nBachelard, on this point, is faithful to tradition: metaphor does not appear to\nhim either simply or necessarily to constitute an obstacle to scientific or philo-\nsophical knowledge. It can work for the critical rectification of a concept, reveal\na concept as a bad metaphor, or finally \"illustrate\" a new concept. In the process\nof scientific knowledge the \"verbal obstacle\" often has the form of metaphor\n(\"metaphoric contrivance,\" \"generalized image,\" \"deficient metaphorical char-\nacter of the explanation\"65 etc.), doubtless. And doubtless the domain of met-\naphor is extended even beyond language, taken in the strict sense of verbal\n\"expression\": \"metaphors seduce reason.\"6' But, on the one hand, the psycho-\nanalysis of objective knowledge above all must denounce \"immediate meta-\nphors\" ('The danger of immediate metaphors in the formation of the scientific\nspirit is that they are not always passing images; they push toward an auton-\nomous kind of thought; they tend to completion and fulfillment in the domain\nof the image\";67 as we will see, it is\nof metaphors that interests\nBachelard initially); and on the other hand, a nonimmediate, constructed met-\naphor is useful when it comes to \"illustrate\" knowledge wrested from bad\nmetaphor. Its value is then essentially pedagogical: \"A psychoanalysis of objec-\ntive knowledge, then, must set itself to blanching, if not to erasing, these naive\n64.

Ibid., p. 78. Bachelard cites Van Swinden: \"'The expression that iron is a sponge\nof magnetic Fluid is therefore a metaphor that departs from the true: and yet all the ex-\nplanations are founded on this expression used in the proper, literal sense. But as for myself,\nI think that it is not exact .\n.\n. to think that reason indicates that these expressions are\nerroneous, and nevertheless to use them in the explanation of Experiments' (1785). In a\nsomewhat confused form, Van Swinden's thought is quite clear: one cannot so easily as\nis alleged confine metaphors only to the realm of expression. Whether one wishes it or\nnot, metaphors seduce reason.\" Immediately afterward, Bachelard shows that \"very great\nminds have been blocked, so to speak, in primary imagery.\" Thus, \"Descartes's meta-\nphysics of space\" would be but a metaphorics of the sponge, \"the metaphysics of the\nsponge\" (p. 79).\n67. Ibid., p. 81. On the contrary, however, the Preliminary Discourse of the work accredits\nthe constructed and constructive metaphors, the metaphors of intermediary status which\nbreak with sensory immediacy and naive realism. They belong to the order of \"figurative\nquantity, midway between the concrete and the abstract, in an intermediary zone.\" \"Sci-\nentific thought then is drawn off in the direction of 'constructions' that are more meta-\nphoncal than real, 'spaces of configuration' whose sensory space, after all, is but an\nimpoverished example\" (p. 5).\n.,cQ\n"

This is surely the occasion to recall that in Bachelard's opinion the\nmetaphoric obstacle is not only an epistemological obstacle due to the persistence, in the\nfield of science, of nonscientific schema deriving from the popular imagination or from\nthe philosophically imaginary. The metaphoric obstade is sometimes a philosophical one,\nwhen scientific schema are imported into a philosophical domain without rhyme or reason.\nOne might speak then of an epistemologizing obstacle. A certain naive scientifism on the\npart of the philosopher can transform scientific discourse into a vast reservoir of metaphors\nor \"models\" for hurried theoreticians. \"Science offers itself to the philosopher as a par-\nticularly rich collection of well constructed and well tied together knowledge. In other\nwords, the philosopher simply demands examples of science.\" These examples \"are always\nmentioned, never developed. Occasionally, the scientific examples are commented upon\naccording to principles which are not scientific ones; they lead to metaphors, analogies,\ngeneralizations.\" La Philosophie\nnon (Paris, 1940), p. 3. In the same direction, see also\nthe end of the chapter on \"the diverse metaphysical explanations of a scientific concept,\"\nand what Bachelard says about the anagogical reverie as a mathematizing reverie, at the\nmoment when the mathematical and the arithmetical intervene in the position of meta-\nphors (pp. 38-40).\n70.

This new articulation, without importing all the metaphysics of the\nclassical opposition, should also account for the specific divisions that episte-\nmology cannot overlook, the divisions between what it calls metaphoric eff?cts\nand scientific effects. The need for this new articulation has undoubtedly been\ncalled for by Nietzsche's discourse. It will have to provoke a displacement and\nan entire reinscription of the values of science and of truth, that is, of several\nothers too.\nI Such a redistribution would have to permit the definition of the \"figure\" which\nnecessarily continues to give its \"sign\" to a \"concept\" after rectification, after\nabandoning a given model \"which perhaps, after all, was only a metaphor.\"6\nThus\u2014second example\u2014when the biological concept of circulation of the blood\nis substituted for the technical concept of irrigation,\" the rectification has not\nreduced every figure of speech.

Tissue comes, as is well known, from tistre, an archaic form of\nthe verb tisser, to weave. If the word cell has appeared to be overburdened with implicit\nsignifications of an affective and social order, the word tissue appears no less burdened\nwith extra-theoretical implications. Cell makes us think of the bee, and not of man. Tissue\nmakes us think of man, and not of the spider. Tissue, a weave, is the human product par\nexcellence\" (La connaissance de la vie, pp. 64\u201465). See also Marx: \"We have to consider labour\nin a form peculiar to the human species. A spider carries on operations resembling those\nof the weaver; and many a human architect is put to shame by the skill with which a bee\nconstructs her cell. But what from the very first distinguishes the most incompetent\narchitect from the best of bees, is that the architect has built a cell in his head before he\nconstructs it in wax. The labour process ends in the creation of something which, when\nthe process began, already existed in the worker's imagination, already existed in an ideal\nform. What happens is, not merely that the worker brings about a change of form in\nmaterial objects, at the same time, in the nature that exists apart from himself, he realizes\nhis own purpose, the purpose which gives the law to his activities, the purpose to which\nhe has to subordinate his own will\" (Capital, book 1, chap. 5, pp. 169\u201470).\n76. \"On this point, thus, experimental embryology and cytology have rectified the\nconcept of organic structure that was too narrowly associated by Claude Bernard with a\nsocial model that perhaps, after all, was only a metaphor.\" \"Le tout et Ia partie dans Ia\npens\u00e9e biologique,\" in Etudes d'histoire et de philosophic des sciences, p. 332.\n77. See La connaissance de la vie, pp. 22\u201423.\n78. From a purely rhetorical point of view, Condillac displays much severity concerning\nthe figures of speech used by Plato (\"the greatest philosopher and the greatest rhetorician\")\nto describe the human body, which he makes into \"a monster that escapes the imagina-\ntion\"; most notably when \"he says that the blood is the grazing ground of the flesh: and so,\nhe goes on, that all the parts may receive nourishment, they have dug, as in a garden, several\ncanals, so that the streams of the veins, emerging from the heart as from their source, can flow in\nthese narrow channels of the human body.\" Condillac contrasts this with six lines from Rous-\nseau, and comments on them thus: \"The flowers which multiply on a stem watered by\na pure stream are a beautiful image of what the love of glory produces in an elevated\nsoul\" (\"Dc I'art d'\u00e9crire,\" in Oeuvres phi!osophiques, p. 555).\n263\n"

Are\nall metaphors, strictly speaking, concepts, and is there any sense in setting\nmetaphor against concept? Does not a scientific critique's rectification rather\nproceed from an inefficient tropic-concept that is poorly constructed, to an op-\nerative tropic-concept that is more refined and more powerful in a given field\nand at a determined phase of the scientific process? The criterion of this progress\nor mutation (\"break,\" \"remodeling,\" and many other forms that should be dis-\ntinguished from each other), has not been defined, certainly, but a double cer-\ntainty now seems problematic: 1. That this criterion must necessarily put to work\na rhetorical evaluation (\"from metaphor to concept,\" for example); 2. That tropes\nmust necessarily belong to the prescientific phase of knowledge.\nIn other words, there is also a concept of metaphor: it too has a history, yields\nknowledge, demands from the epistemologist construction, rectifications, critical\nrules of importation and exportation.\nWe come back to our question: can one transport into the philosophical field\nthe Bachelardian program of a metapoetics?\nproposes to proceed by\ngroups and diagrams, and this is what will retain us first. By groups:\n\"When one has meditated on the freedom of metaphors and on their limits,\none perceives that certain poetic images are projected onto one another with\ncertainty and exactitude, which amounts to saying that in projective poetry they\nare but one and the same image. In studying the Psychoanalysis of fire, we have\nperceived, for example, that all the 'images' of the internal fire, the hidden fire,\nthe fire glowing beneath the embers, in short the unseen fire that consequently\ncalls for metaphors, are 'images' of life. The projective link, then, is so primitive\nthat one easily translates, certain of universal comprehension, images of life into\nimages of fire, and vice versa. The deformation of the images then must des-\nignate, in a strictly mathematical way, the group of metaphors. Immediately that\none can specify the diverse groups of metaphors of a particular poetry, one would\nperceive that occasionally certain metaphors fail because they have been added\nin defiance of the cohesion of the group. Naturally, sensitive poetic souls react\nby themselves to these erroneous additions, without needing the pedantic ap-\nparatus to which we are alluding. But it remains no less that a metapoetics will\nhave to undertake a classification of metaphors, and that sooner or later it will\nhave to adopt the only essential procedure of classification, the determination\nof\n79.

Here, the projective model permits one to\nrecognize not only the syntactic coherence of metaphors, but above all the original and\nfinal unity of their theme, their central semantic focal point. The demonstration of this\npoint, moreover, is rather remarkable: the multiplicity of images (the images of fire, with\nwhich this metaphorology first had to concern itself) refers, while reflecting it, to the same\n264\n"

The word is written only in the plural. If there were only one\npossible metaphor, the dream at the heart of philosophy, if one could reduce\ntheir play to the circle of a family or a group of metaphors, that is, to one\n\"central,\" \"fundamental,\" \"principial\" metaphor, there would be no more true\nmetaphor, but only, through the one true metaphor, the assured legibility of the\nproper. Now, it is because the metaphoric is plural from the outset that it does\nnot escape syntax; and that it gives rise, in philosophy too, to a text which is\nnot exhausted in the history of its meaning (signified concept or metaphoric\ntenor: thesis), in the visible or invisible presence of its theme (meaning and truth\nof Being). But it is also because the metaphoric does not reduce syntax, and on\nthe contrary organizes its divisions within syntax, that it gets carried away with\nitself, cannot be what it is except in erasing itself, indefinitely constructing its\ndestruction.\nThis self-destruction always will have been able to take\ncourses which are\nalmost tangent, and yet different, repeating, miming, and separating from each\nother according to certain laws. One of these courses follows the line of a\nresistance to the dissemination of the metaphorical in a syntactics that some-\nwhere, and initially, carries within itself an irreducible loss of meaning: this is\nthe metaphysical rel\u00e8ve of metaphor in the proper meaning of Being. The gen-\n?ralization of metaphor can signify this parousia. Metaphor then is included by\nJmetaphysics as that which must be carried off to a horizon or a proper ground,\nand which must finish by rediscovering the origin of its truth. The turn of the\nsun is interpreted then as a specular circle, a return to itself without loss of\nmeaning, without irreversible expenditure.

Their plastic\nseverity and solidity does not tolerate the sort of blending involved in metaphor\nor permit them to stray hither and thither away from the homogenous material\nand the simple, self-contained, complete cast, in order to gather up so-called\n'flowers' of expression (sogennante Blumen des Ausdrucks aufzulesen) here and\nthere. But metaphor is always an interruption of the course of ideas (Vorstel-\nlungsganges) .\n. . On the other hand, it is particularly the East, especially the\nlater Mohammedan poetry, which uses figurative expressions and indeed has\nthem of necessity.\"8'\nMetaphor, therefore, is determined by philosophy as a provisional loss of\nmeaning, an economy of the proper without irreparable damage, a certainly\ninevitable detour, but also a history with its sights set on, and within the horizon\n\u2022of, the circular reappropriation of literal, proper meaning. This is why the phil-\nevaluation of metaphor always has been ambiguous: metaphor is\ndangerous and foreign as concerns intuition (vision or contact), concept (the grasp-\ning or proper presence of the signified), and consciousness (proximity or self-\npresence); but it is in complicity with what it endangers, is necessary to it in the\nkextent to which the de-tour is a re-turn guided by the function of resemblance\n(mim\u00ebsis or homoi\u00f6sis), under the law of the same. The opposition of intuition,\nthe concept, and consciousness at this point no longer has any pertinence. These\nthree values belong to the order and to the movement of meaning. Like meta-\nphor.\nHenceforth the entire teleology of meaning, which constructs the philosophical\nconcept of metaphor, coordinates metaphor with the manifestation of truth, with\nthe production of truth as presence without veil, with the reappropriation of a\nfull language without syntax, with the vocation of a pure nomination: without\ndifferential syntax, or in any case without a properly unnarnable articulation that\nis irreducible to the semantic rel\u00e8ve or to dialectical interiorization.\nThe.other self-destructiotiof metaphor thus resembles the philosophical one to\nthe point of being taken for it. This time, then, in traversing and doubling the\nfirst self-destruction, it passes through a supplement of syntactic resistance,\nthrough everything (for example in modern linguistics) that disrupts the op-\nposition of the semantic and the syntactic, and especially the philosophical\nhierarchy that submits the latter to the former. This self-destruction still has the\nform of a generalization, but this time it is no longer a question of extending\nand confirming a philosopheme, but rather, of unfolding it without limit, and\nwresting its borders of propriety from it.

Sometimes the\ncommunication is only delayed, and the internal circuit serves as a preparation\nfor a circuit of external intention: then there is emission to choice\" (C. 24, p. 99,\n1940).\nThe difference between internal speech and external speech therefore passes\nunderstanding. No concept can make it its own. Its reserve is almost unheard\u2014\nwith what ear could it be heard?\u2014or in any event undescribable. Thirty years\nearlier: \"How to write this singular difference rationally?\" (C. 3, p. 483, 1905).15\nHow to write it, in effect, if writing, phonetic writing above all, precisely has\nas its function the restitution of speech to the internal regime, and to act such\nthat in its event effectively proffered speech is but an accident lost for reading?\nThe regime, being regimented, in effect seems to insure the \"normal\" com-\nmunication of the source with itself, thereby regularly circulating between the\nexternal event and the internal event, conferring upon the origin the invisible\nappearing, the calm being near to itself that the glance saw itself refused.\nNow here, again, Valery remarks a cutting difference: not the external probation\nwhich accidentally would come to interrupt the circle, but already the circuit's\nreturn to itself: \"Who speaks, who listens (in the interior speechi? It is not exactly\nthe same .\n. . The existence of the speech from self to self is the sign of a cut\"\n(C. 7, p. 615, 1920). The cirde turns in order to annul the cut, and\nthe same token,\nThe snak\nits tail, fr\u00f3\nwich r\nfollow that it finally rejoins itself without harm in this\nsuccessful auto-fellatio of which we have been speaking all along, in truth.\n15. \"Ext. speech differs from secret speech only through the functions which are as-\nsociated and co-ordinated with it\u2014weighing it down with their inertia and their passive /\nresistances, but making it subject to their more arduous and solid\u2014more tied together\u2014\nworld. All exterior speech is reduced to an interior speech by creating these auxiliary\nfunctions: 0. This is a projection. But conversely, all in, speech cannot become exterior\"\n(C. 3, p. 483, 1905).

He reconstructs quasi-czech-\nanisms capable of giving back to him the energy they cost him and zuore (for here the principles\nare apparently violated).

And if so, impossible for whom,\nfor what, according to what space?\nHere we come to philosophy.\nValery lays out his entire reading of the history of philosophy according to\nthis snare. The philosopher\u2014it is he of whom Valery speaks, and whom Valery\nsummons to appear, rather than philosophy itself\u2014is the person who wears\nhimself out over vain questions of origin: an illusion both transcendental and\nnatural, natural since it invincibly returns to the orient, to \"nature,\" to birth, to\nthe source. Everywhere that \"nature\" intervenes in philosophical discourse, that\nis everywhere, Valery pursues it with ironic apostrophes that never aim at nature\nalone, but also the entire cortege of distinctions and oppositions that nature\nactivates and\nLet us sketch out the scheme of this critical solicitation of philosophical dis-\ncourse. It always insists upon a crisis of the origin.\nValery reminds the philosopher that philosophy is written.

Discontinuity, delay, heterogeneity, and alterity already were work-\ning upon the voice, producing it from its first breath as a system of differential\ntraces, that is as writing before the letter. Philosophical writing, then, literally\ncomes to bridge this gap, to close the dike, and to dream of virgin continuity.\nWhence Valery's apparently paradoxical argument, which opposes the con-\ntinuousness of writing, or rather of the graphic, to the discontinuousness of\nspeech. The philosopher intends to come back to the proximity of the speaking\nsource, or rather to the source murmuring its interior speech, and to deny that\nhe is writing. Terrified by the difference within hearing-oneself-speak, by the\nwriting within speech, the philosopher writes\u2014on the page\u2014in order to erase\nand to forget that when he speaks the evil of the cipher is already there in germ.\n\"But the nature of language is quite opposed to the happy outcome of this great\n17.

In\nvain have they created or transfigured certain words; they could not succeed in\ntransmitting their inner reality. Whatever the words may be\u2014Ideas or Dynamis\nor Being or Noumenon or Cogito or Ego\u2014they are all ciphers, the meaning of\nwhich is determined solely by the context; and so it is finally by a sort of personal\ncreation that their reader\u2014as also happens with readers of poetry\u2014gives the\nforce of life to writings in which ordinary speech is contorted into expressing\nvalues that men cannot exchange and that do not exist in the realm of spoken\nwords\" (8, 150\u201451; Valery's italics).\nThese philosophical ciphers formalize natural language and tend to forge, by\nmeans of the contract of their conventional formality, a kind of chain of security,\nof quasi-continuous plenitude which occasionally makes these ciphers resemble\nthe thing itself. They tend to erase the breaks, the tremors working within\nspeech and writing in what is called \"natural language,\" which is also, from the\nstart, a diastemic organization, a system of \"arbitrary\" signs, or in any event\nof discrete and diacritical signs. Now the paradoxical law that Valery was able\nto recognize is that the more the graphic is formalized the more it is naturalized.\nAs an artist of form, which is what he is from Valery's point of view, the phi-\nlosopher is still dreaming of nature. Here we might elaborate the motif of a\ncritique of formalist illusion which would complicate what is often considered\nto be Valery's formalism somewhat. The complication is due to the fact that\nformality, far from simply being opposed to it, simultaneously produces and de-\nstroys the naturalist, \"originarist\" illusion. Always insufficiently formalized, still\ntoo embroiled in natural language, in natural language's vagueness, equivocal-\nness, and metaphoricity, philosophical writing does not support comparison\nwith its model: the rigor and exactitude of a purely formal language. Valery has\njust recalled the effort of the philosopher wearing himself out in making his\nthoughts speak: \"Today, in a number of truly remarkable cases, even the expression\nof things by means of discrete signs, arbitrarily chosen, has given way to lines\ntraced by the things themselves, or to transpositions or inscriptions directly\nderived from them. The great invention that consists in making the laws of\nscience visible to the eyes and, as it were, readable on sight has been incorporated\ninto knowledge; and it has in some sort doul;led the world of experience with a\nvisible world of curves, surfaces, and diagrams that translate properties into\nforms whose inflexions we can follow with our eyes, thus by our consciousness\nof this movement gaining an impression of values in\na\nthat cannot be rendered in speech, and it is superior\nto speech in\nUtat\nthe method to exist; doubtless it is now speech\nissigns a\nto\nthem; but it is no longer by speech that the act of\nmental possession is consummated.
