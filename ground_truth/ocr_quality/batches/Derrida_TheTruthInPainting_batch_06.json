And \nyet. From the moment the cartouche on \"surgery,\" on the first \npage, associates in a note-cartouche of the cartouche-the coffin \nand the matchbox, then this contiguity forms part of the serial \nwork. It belongs to that work at least as a parergon. \nFor what's a matchbox when all's said and done? \nA parellelepiped like the coffin and of about the same size (if \nit's designed for the kitchen), the matchbox has the peculiarity \nthat it does not open, like so many other caskets, along the ar\u00ad\nticulation of a hinge. See for example the role of the hinge in The \nUse of the Necessary. Here, for once, one box opens or shuts by \nsliding into another, which is none other than itself. A box open \non top fits into [s'emboite dans] another box, the same box, open \non two sides, at its last extremities. The hermetic closure com\u00ad\nposes the two openings, is composed by them both. The box \ndecomposes-into two independent boxes; and boxes itself in [se \nmet en boite] in this decomposition. Now sliding the coffin into \nthe catafalque involves a boxing-in of this type. This mise en \nboite of the box does indeed, in Funeral Rites, form one of the \nmany movements which induce the coup de theatre, after this \none, which prepared things from a greater distance: \n\"I wonder why Death, film stars, virtuosi abroad, queens in \nexile, banished kings, have a body, a face, hands. Fascination for \nthem comes from something other than a human charm, and \nSarah Bernhardt, without disappointing the enthusiasm of the \npeasant women who wanted to catch a glimpse of her at the door \nof her railway carriage, could have appeared in the form of a little \nbox of Swedish matches. We hadn't come to see a face but Jean \nD. dead . . . .  \" \n"

In his pocket, he has put the coffin in the place of the \"petit \ncalepin noir\" (little black notebook). \nTo what I said yesterday, add this: TlingIT sets off a palin\u00ad\ndrome, off to meet another more or less crucial T. In the I 5  Latin \nIncisions, under the article \"Lucretius,\" the name Titus was read \nbackwards as 2UTIT.

It sets up and dismantles [monte et de\u00ad\nmonte], breaks up and patches together [met en pieces et \nrapiece] around a hyphen with which he signs: this is the \nbody of my name. And my name has the same number of \nletters, again it's crucial, and it's framed by four consonants, \nof which the two central ones, around the hyphen, precisely, \nare the same (S-C), as those of JesUS Christ, (5 -6). And one \ncan also read 5 + 6 \n= \n1 1 or 5 - 6 \n= \n- I .  \nThe whole arithmetic of the coffin would be recapitulated \nhere. Just before: \"THAT BEING THE CASE, PUT THE MODEL IN ONE'S \nPOCKET\" (whose pocket, by the way?), his cartouche had invoked, \napparently apropos of something quite different, the Isenheim \nCrucifixion by Matthias Grunewald. \nIf I say that the hyphen is not only an emblem, a motto, a \ncoat of arms or an armorial crest but the symbol, this is so as to \nrecall that any symbol is, stricto sensu, a hyphen, bringing to\u00ad\ngether, according to the symballein, the two pieces of a body \ndivided in contract, pact, or alliance.
