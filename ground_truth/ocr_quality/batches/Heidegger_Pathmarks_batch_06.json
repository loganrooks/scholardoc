Of course, the placing and the appearance do not \nstand off by themselves; rather, it is only in a given being that they can be pointed \nout by addressing them. However, that which takes its stand from these (i.e., from \nthe order-able and from the placing) is certainly not \u2022pvou; itself, although it is a \n'?':,,.e:\u06aa-being - such as, for example, a human being.\" (193 b3-6) \nThese sentences do not simply recapitulate the already proven thesis, \nnamely, that tp\u2022)a`c; can be spoken of in two ways. Much more important is \nthe emphasis given to the crucial thought that tp(\u2022o`c;, spoken of in two ways, \nis not a being but a manner of being. Therefore, Aristotle again presses home \nthe point: the appearance and the placing into the appearance must not be \ntaken Platonically as standing apart unto themselves, but as the being [Sein] \nin which an individual being stands at any given moment - for example, \nthis person here. To be sure, this individual being is from UA'IJ and !JOptpf;, \nbut precisely for this reason it is a being and not a way of being - not tpvo`c;, \nas are !JOptpf; and OAlJ in their inherent togetherness. In other words, it now \nbecomes clear to what extent Aristotle's [352] distinction between OAlJ and \nf!Optpf; is not simply another formula for Antiphon's distinction between \nlippv6!J`o\u2022ov and pv6!J6c;. These latter terms are intended to define tpvo`c;. \nbut they only designate beings - the stable as distinct from the unstable. \nThey do not grasp, much less conceptualize, tpuo`c; as being, i.e., as what \nmakes up the stability or standing-on-its-own of tpvoe:` llv'ta. Such being can \nbe understood only if we use Myoc; as our clue. But addressing things shows \nthat the appearance and the placedness into the appearance are primary, and \nfrom them what we call OAlJ is then determined as the orderable. But with \nthat, yet another issue already gets decided, but one that prompts the next \nstep in the demonstration that tpuo`c; is !JOptpf;. Although OAlJ and !Joptpf; \nboth constitute the essence of tpuo`c;, they do not carry equal weight. Moptpf; \nhas priority. With that we are saying that the coune of the demonstration as \ncarried out so far now lifts the task of the demonstration one level higher. \nAnd Aristotle loses no time in saying so: \nXV. \"\\\\!hat is more, this (namely, !JOp\u2022;rf, as the placing into the appearance) is '?')mx \nto a gnattT degree than the orderable is. For each individual thing is addressed [as \nproperly being) when it 'is' in the mode of having-itself-in-its-end rather than when \nit is (only) in the state of appropriatenes for . . .  \" (193 b6-8) \nWhy is it that !JOptpf; is tp\u2022)a`c; not only on a par with ijl-lj but \"to a greater \ndegree\"?

Earlier still it was established that 'P'JOEL ovtCI are XLVO'J!lEVCI: their \nbeing is movedness. \nWe now have to grasp movedness as ol)o(CI; i.e., we must say what moved\u00ad\nness is. Only in this way do we clarify what 'P'JOLc; is as apxt, XLv\u0017otwc;, and \nonly from the thus clarified essence of 'P'JOLc; will we see why lloprp\u0017 more \nfulfills what ol')otCI is and therefore why it is rpuoLc; to a greater degree. \nWhat is movedness, taken as the being - i.e., the presencing - of a mov\u00ad\ning being? Aristotle gives the answer in Physics r 1-3. It would be pre\u00ad\nsumptuous to try to capture in a few sentences an essential insight into \nAristotle's interpretation of movedness, the most difficult thing Western \nmetaphysics has had to ponder in the course of its history. Still we must try \nto do so, at least to a degree that will allow us to follow the demonstration \nof the !JOptp\u0490-character of tp,)mc;. The reason for the difficulty in Aristotle's \ndefinition of the essence [of movedness1 lies in the strange simplicity of the \nessential insight. It is a simplicity we seldom achieve because even now we \nhardly have an inkling of the Greek concept of being, and likewise, in re\u00ad\nflecting on the Greek experience of movedness, we forget what is decisive, \nnamely, that the Greeks conceive of movedness in terms of rest. [3541 At \nthis point we must distinguish between movedness and movement, as well \nas between rest and repose. Movedness means the essence from which both \nmovement and rest are determined. Rest is then the \"cessation\" (r.CI'JEO'aCIL, \nMetaphysics 0 6, 1048 bz6) of movement. The lack of movement can be cal\u00ad\nculated as its limit-case (= o).

Thus the assertion, \"Clearly actuality is prior to potentiality\" seems to \nbe evidently in error, for the contrary is more plausible. Surely in order for \nsomething to be \"actual\" and to be able to be \"actual,\" it must first be possi\u00ad\nble. Thus, potentiality is prior to actuality. But if we reason this way, we are \nnot thinking either with Aristotle or with the Greeks in general.

No, quite the contrary, he conceives of rp\u2022)oLc; \nas self-production. But is not \"production\" the same as \"making\"? It is \nfor us so long as we wander thoughtlessly among worn-out ideas instead \nof holding on to what was already pointed out. But what if we should find \nour way back to the realm of being as understood by the Greeks? Then we \nsee that making, \u0511o(lJoLc;, is one kind of production, whereas \"growing\" (the \ngoing back into itself and emerging out of itself), rpuoLc;, is another. Here \"to \npro-duce\" cannot mean \"to make\" but rather: to place something into the \nunhiddenness of its appearance; to let something become present; presenc\u00ad\ning. From this notion of pro-duction the essence of generation [Ent-stehen] \nand of its various kinds may be determined. Instead of \"generation\" we \nshould have to say \"derivation\" [Ent-steOung], which is not to be taken in its \nusual sense but rather as meaning: to derive from one appearance that ap\u00ad\npearance into which something pro-duced (in any given instance) is placed \nand thus is. Now there are different kinds of such \"derivation.\" Something \ngenerated (say, a table) can be derived from one appearance (the appearance \nof \"table\") and placed forth into the same kind of appearance without the \nfirst appearance, from which [36o] the table is derived, itself performing the \nplacing into the appearance. The first appearance (e:l8oc;), \"table,\" remains \nonly a \u0512ilpa8e:LY!.lil, something that certainly shows up in the production but \ndoes nothing more than that and therefore requires something else that can \nfirst place the orderable wood, as something appropriate for appearing as \na table, into that appearance. In those cases where the appearance merely \nshows up, and in showing up only guides a !mow-how in the producing \nof it and plays an accompanying role rather than actually peifurming the \nproduction - there production is a making. \nThis way of showing up is cenainly one kind of presencing, but it is not \nthe only kind. It is also possible that an appearance - without showing up \nspecifically as a ;;CLpa8e:LY!.lil, namely, in and for a 'tEX\"\"'i - can directly present \nitself as what takes over the placing into itself. The appearance places itself \nforth. Here we have the placing of an appearance.

The zeal\u00ad\nous pursuit of \"types\" and \"countertypes\" of\"feelings\" and of varieties and \nsubspecies of these \"types\" will never run out of prey.

So as to indicate that \"logic\" is only one interpretation of \nthe essence of thinking, indeed the one that, as its very name shows, rests \nupon the experience of being attained in Greek thought. The suspicion \nregarding \"logic,\" whose consequential development degenerates into lo\u00ad\ngistics, springs from a knowledge belonging to that thinking which finds its \nsource in the experience of the truth of being, but not in contemplating the \nobjectivity of beings. Exact thinking is never the most rigorous thinking, if \nrigor indeed receives its essence from the kind of rigorous effort whereby \nknowledge in each case maintains itself within a relation to what is essential \nin beings. Exact thinking merely binds itself to the calculation of beings \nand serves this end exclusively. \nAl calculation lets what is countable be resolved into something count\u00ad\ned that can then be used for subsequent counting. Calculation refuses to \nlet anything appear except what is countable. Everything is only whatever \nit counts. \\Vhat has been counted in each instance secures the continu\u00ad\nation of counting. Such counting progressively consumes numbers, and \nis itself a continual self-consumption. The calculative process of resolv\u00ad\ning beings into what has been counted counts as the explanation of their \nbeing. Calculation uses all beings in advance as that which is countable, \nand uses up what is counted for the purpose of counting. This use of be\u00ad\nings that consumes them betrays the consuming character of calculation. \nOnly because number can be infinitely multiplied, irrespective of whether \nthis occurs in the direction of the large or the small, can the consum\u00ad\ning essence of calculation hide behind its products and lend to calculative \nthinking the semblance of productivity - whereas already in its anticipa\u00ad\ntory grasping, and not primarily in its subsequent results, such thinking lets \nall beings count only in the form of what can be set at our disposal and \nconsumed. Calculative thinking compels itself into a compulsion to master \neverything on the basis of the consequential correctness of its procedure. It \nis unable to foresee that everything calculable by calculation - prior to the \nsum-totals and products that it produces by calculation in each case - is al\u00ad\nready a whole, a whole whose unity indeed [ 105] belongs to the incalculable \nthat withdraws itself and its uncanniness from the claws of calculation.

Of course, our words mijg/ich \n[possible] and JHijg/ichkeit [possibility], under the dominance of\"logic\" and \n\"metaphysics,\" are thought solely in contrast to \"actuality\"; that is, they \nare thought on the basis of a definite - the metaphysical - interpretation \nof being as actus and potentia, a distinction identified with that between \ne:ristentin and essentia) When I speak of the \"quiet power of the possible\" \nI do not mean the possibile of a merely represented possibilitas, nor potentia \nas the essentia of an actus of existentia; rather, I mean being itself, which in \nits favoring presides over thinking and hence over the essence of humanity, \nand that means over its relation to being. To enable something here means \nto preserve it in its essence, to maintain it in its element. \nWhen thinking comes to an end by slipping out of its element it replaces \nthis loss by procuring a validity for itself as -ctxvr,, as an instrument of educa\u00ad\ntion and therefore as a classroom matter [149] and later a cultural concern. \nBy and by philosophy becomes a technique for explaining from highest \ncauses.

The dominance of such terms is \nnot accidental. It rests above all in the modem age upon the peculiar dic\u00ad\ntatorship of the public realm. However, so-called \"private existence\" is not \nreally essential, that is to say free, human being. It simply ossifies in a denial \nof the public realm. It remains an offshoot that depends upon the public \nand nourishes itself by a mere withdrawal from it. Hence it testifies, against \nits own will, to its subservience to the public realm. But because it stems \nfrom the dominance of subjectivity the public realm itself is the metaphysi\u00ad\ncally conditioned establishment and authorization of the openness of beings \nin the unconditional objectification of everything. Language thereby falls \ninto the service of expediting communication along routes where objectifi\u00ad\ncation - the uniform accessibility of everything to everyone - branches out \nand disregards all limits. In this way language comes under the dictatorship \nof the public realm, which decides in advance what is intelligible and what \nmust be rejected as unintelligible. \\Vhat is said in Being and Time (1927), \nsections 2 7 and 35, about the \"they\" in no way means to furnish an inciden\u00ad\ntal contribution to sociology.

This relation remains concealed amid the dominance of subjectivity \nthat presents itself as the public realm. But if the truth of being has become \nthought-provoking for thinking, then reflection on the essence oflanguage \nmust also attain a different rank. It can no longer be a mere philosophy of \nlanguage. [ 150] That is the only reason Being and Time (section 34) contains \na reference to the essential dimension of language and touches upon the \nsimple question as to what mode of being language as language in any given \ncase has. The widely and rapidly spreading devastation of language not only \nundermines aesthetic and moral responsibility in every use of language; it \narises from a threat to the essence of hwnanity. A merely cultivated use \nof language is still no proof that we have as yet escaped this danger to our \nessence. These days, in fact, such usage might sooner testify that we have \nnot yet seen and cannot see the danger because we have never yet placed \nourselves in view of it. Much bemoaned of late, and much too lately, the \ndecline of language is, however, not the grounds for, but already a conse\u00ad\nquence of, the state of affairs in which language under the dominance of the \nmodem metaphysics of subjectivity almost irremediably falls out of its ele\u00ad\nment. Language still denies us its essence: that it is the house of the truth of \nbeing. Instead, language surrenders itself to our mere willing and traffick\u00ad\ning as an instrument of domination over beings. Beings themselves appear \nas actualities in the interaction of cause and effect. We encounter beings as \nactualities in a calculative businesslike way, but also scientifically and by way \nof philosophy, with explanations and proofs. Even the assurance that some\u00ad\nthing is inexplicable belongs to these explanations and proofs. With such \nstatements we believe that we confront the mystery. As if it were already \ndecided that the truth of being lets itself at all be established in causes and ex\u00ad\nplanatory grounds or, what comes to the same, in their incomprehensibility. \nBut if the human being is to find his way once again into the nearness of \nbeing he must first learn to exist in the nameless. In the same way he must \nrecognize the seductions of the public realm as well as the impotence of the \nprivate. Before he speaks the human being must first let himself be claimed \nagain by being, taking the risk that under this claim he will seldom have \nmuch to say. Only thus will [ 151] the pricelessness of its essence be once \nmore bestowed upon the word, and upon humans a home for dwelling in \nthe truth of being. \nBut in the claim upon human beings, in the attempt to make humans \nready for this claim, is there not implied a concern about human beings? \n\\Vherc else does \"care\" tend but in the direction of bringing the human \nbeing back to his essence?

For this is humanism: meditating and caring, \nthat human beings be human and not inhumane, \"inhuman,\" that is, outside \ntheir essence. But in what does the humanity of the human being consist? \nIt lies in his essence. \nBut whence and how is the essence of the human being determined? \nMarx demands that \"the human being's humanity\" be recognized and ac\u00ad\nknowledged. He finds it in \"society.\" The \"social\" human is for him the \n\"natural\" human. In \"society\" human \"nature,\" that is, the totality of \"nat\u00ad\nural needs\" (food, clothing, reproduction, economic sufficiency), is equably \nsecured. The Christian sees the humanity of man, the humanitas of homo, \nin contradistinction to Deitas. He is the human being of the history of re\u00ad\ndemption who as a \"child of God\" hears and accepts the call of the Father \nin Christ. The human being is not of this world, since the \"world,\" thought \nin terms of Platonic theory, is only a temporary passage to the beyond. \nHumanitas, explicidy so called, was first considered and striven for in the \nage of the Roman Republic. Homo humanus was opposed to homo barbarus. \nHomo humanus here means the Romans, who exalted and honored Roman \nvirtus through the \"embodiment\" of the ltaLIIEta [education] taken over from \nthe Greeks. These were the Greeks of the Hellenistic age, whose culture \nwas acquired in the [ 1 52] schools of philosophy. It was concerned with \nenuiitio et institutio in bonas artes [scholarship and training in good conduct). \nIlaLIIEta thus understood was translated as humanitas. The genuine roman\u00ad\nitas of homo romanus consisted in such humanitas. We encounter the first \nhumanism in Rome: it therefore remains in essence a specifically Roman \nphenomenon, which emerges from the encounter of Roman civilization \nwith the culture of late Greek civilization. The so-called Renaissance of \nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Italy is a renascentia romanitatis. Be\u00ad\ncause romanitas is what matters, it is concerned with humanitas and therefore \nwith Greek r.clLIIE[a. But Greek civilization is always seen in its later form \nand this itself is seen from a Roman point of view. The homo romantiS of \nthe Renaissance also stands in opposition to homo barbarus. But now the \nin-humane is the supposed barbarism of Gothic Scholasticism in the Mid\u00ad\ndle Ages. Therefore a muJium humanitatis, which in a certain way reaches \nback to the ancients and thus also becomes a revival of Greek civiliza\u00ad\ntion, always adheres to historically understood humanism. For Germans \nthis is apparent in the humanism of the eighteenth century supported by \nWinckelmann, Goethe, and Schiller. On the other hand, Holderlin does \nnot belong to \"humanism,\" precisely because he thought the destiny of the \nessence of the human being in a more original way than \"humanism\" could. \n"

In Being and Ti11e (p. 42) this sentence is italicized: \n\"The 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence.\" However, here the opposi\u00ad\ntion between existentia and essentia is not what is at issue, because neither \nof these metaphysical determinations of being, let alone their relationship, \nis yet in question. Still less does the sentence contain a universal statement \n[ 1 57] about Dasein, in the sense in which this word came into fashion in \nthe eighteenth century, as a name for \"object,\" intending to express the \nmetaphysical concept of the actuality of the actual. On the contrary, the \nsentence says: the human being occurs essentially in such a way that he is \nthe \"there\" [das \"Daj, that is, the clearing of being. The \"being\" of the \nDa, and only it, has the fundamental character of ek-sistence, that is, of an \necstatic inherence in the truth of being. The ecstatic essence of the human \nbeing consists in ek-sistence, which is different from the metaphysically \nconceived existentia. Medieval philosophy conceives the latter as actuali\u00ad\ntas. Kant represents existentia as actuality in the sense of the objectivity \nof experience. Hegel defines existentia as the self-knowing Idea of abso\u00ad\nlute subjectivity. Nietzsche grasps existentia as the eternal recurrence of the \nsame. Here it remains an open question whether through existentia - in \nthese explanations of it as actuality that at first seem quite different - the \nbeing of a stone or even life as the being of plants and animals is adequately \nthought. In any case living creatures are as they are without standing out\u00ad\nside their being as such and within the truth of being, preserving in such \nstanding the essential nature of their being. Of all the beings that are, pre\u00ad\nsumably the most difficult to think about are living creatures, because on \nthe one hand they are in a certain way most closely akin to us, and on the \nother they are at the same time separated from our ek-sistent essence by \nan abyss. However, it might also seem as though the essence of divinity is \ncloser to us than what is so alien in other living creatures, closer, namely, \nin an essential distance that, however distant, is nonetheless more familiar \nto our ek-sistent essence than is our scarcely conceivable, abysmal bodily \nkinship with the beast. Such reflections cast a strange light upon the cur\u00ad\nrent and therefore always still premature designation of the human being as \na11imaJ 1\u00b7ationa/e.
