The possibility of \nproceeding towards Dasein's Being by going along with it and following \nit up [Mit- und Nachgehen] Interpretatively with an understanding and \nthe state-of-mind that goes with it, is the greater, the more primordial is \nthat phenomenon which functions methodologically as a disclosive state\u00ad\nof-mind. It might be contended that anxiety performs some such function. \nWe are not entirely unprepared for the analysis of anxiety. Of course it \nstill remains obscure how this is connected ontologically with fear. \nObviously these are kindred phenomena. This is betokened by the fact \nthat for the most part they have not been distinguished from one another: \nthat which is fear, gets designated as \"anxiety\", while that which has the \ncharacter of anxiety, gets called \"fear\". We shall try to proceed towards \nthe phenomenon of anxiety step by step. \nDasein's falling into the \"they\" and the 'world' of its concern, is what \nwe have called a 'fleeing' in the face of itself. But one is not necessarily \nfleeing whenever one shrinks back in the face of something or turns away \nfrom it. Shrinking back in the face of what fear discloses-in the face of \nsomething threatening-is founded upon fear; and this shrinking back has \nthe character of fleeing. Our Interpretation of fear as a state-of-mind has \nshown that in each case that in the face of which we fear is a detrimental \nentity within-the-world which comes from some definite region but is \nclose by and is bringing itself close, and yet might stay away. In falling, \nDasein turns away from itself. That in the face of which it thus shrinks \nback must, in any case, be an entity with the character of threatening; yet \nthis entity has the same kind of Being as the one that shrinks back: it is \nDasein itself. That in the face of which it thus shrinks back cannot be \ntaken as something 'fearsome', for anything 'fearsome' is always encoun\u00ad\ntered as an entity within-the-world. The only threatening which can be \nx86 \n'fearsome' and which gets discovered in fear, always comes from entities \nwithin-the-world. \nThus the turning-away offalling is not a fleeing that is founded upon a \nfear of entities within-the-world. Fleeing that is so grounded is still less \na character of this turning-away, when what this turning-away does is \nprecisely to tum thither towards entities within-the-world by absorbing \nitself in them. The turning-away of falling is grounded rather in anxiety, which in \nturn is what first makes fear possible. \nTo understand this talk about Dasein's fleeing in the face of itself in \nfalling, we must recall that Being-in-the-world is a basic state of Dasein. \nThat in the face of which one has anxiety [ das Wovor der Angst] is Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld as such.

Anxiety \nthus takes away from Dasein the possibility of understanding itself, as it \nfalls, in terms of the 'world' and the way things have been publicly inter\u00ad\npreted. Anxiety throws Dasein back upon that which it is anxious about \n-its authentic potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world.

Anxiety brings Dasein face to face with its Being\u00ad\nfree for (propensio in \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ) the authenticity of its Being, and for this authen\u00ad\nticity as a possibility which it always is. 2 But at the same time, this is the \n1 'Allein dieses Nichts von Zuhandenem, das die alltiigliche umsichtige Rede einzig \nversteht, ist kein totales Nichts.'

This levelling off of Dasein's possibilities to what is \nproximally at its everyday disposal also results in a dimming down of the \n195 \npossible as such. The average everydayness of concern becomes blind to \nits possibilities, and tranquillizes itself with that which is merely 'actual'. \nThis tranquillizing does not rule out a high degree of diligence in one's \nconcern, but arouses it. In this case no positive new possibilities are willed, \nbut that which is at one's disposal becomes 'tactically' altered in such a \nway that there is a semblance of something happening. \nAl the same, this tranquillized 'willing' under the guidance of the \n\"they\", does not signify that one's Being towards one's potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing has been extinguished, but only that it has been modified. In such \na case, one's Being towards possibilities shows itself for the most part as \nmere wishing. In the wish Dasein projects its Being upon possibilities which \nnot only have not been taken hold of in concern, but whose fulfilment has \nnot even been pondered over and expected. On the contrary, in the mode \nof mere wishing, the ascendancy of Being-ahead-of-oneself brings with it \na lack of understanding' for the factical possibilities. When the world has \nbeen primarily projected as a wish-world, Being-in-the-world has lost \nitselfinertly in what is at its disposal ; but it has done so in such a way \nthat, in the light of what is wished for, that which is at its disposal (and \nthis is all that is ready-to-hand) is never enough.

Ontologically, wishing \npresupposes care. \nIn hankering, Being-already-alongside . . .  takes priority. The \"ahead\u00ad\nof-itself-in-Being-already-in \n\u2022\n.\n.\n \" is correspondingly modified. Dasein's \nhankering as it falls makes manifest its addiction to becoming 'lived' by \nwhatever world it is in. This addiction shows the character of Being out \nfor something [Ausseins auf . . .  ]. Being-ahead-of-oneself has lost itself in \na 1ust-always-already-alongside'. 2 What one is addicted 'towards' [Das \n\"Hin-zu\" des Ranges] is to let oneself be drawn by the sort of thing for \nwhich the addiction hankers. IfDasein, as it were, sinks into an addiction \nthen there is not merely an addiction present-at-hand, but the entire \nstructure of care has been modified. Dasein has become blind, and puts \nall possibilities into the service of the addiction. \nOn the other hand, the urge 'to live' is something 'towards' which one \nis impelled, and it brings the impulsion along with it of its own accord. 3 \nIt is 'towards this at any price'. The urge seeks to crowd out [verdrangen] \nother possibilities. Here too the Being-ahead-of-oneself is one that is \ninauthentic, even if one is assailed by an urge coming from the very thing \nthat is urging one on. The urge can outrun one's current state-of-mind \nI g6 \nand one's understanding. But then Dasein is not-and never is-a 'mere \nurge' to which other kinds of controlling or guiding behaviour are added \nfrom time to time; rather, as a modification of the entirety of Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world, it is always care already. \nIn pure urge, care has not yet become free, though care first makes it \nontologically possible for Dasein to be urged on by itself.' In addiction, \nhowever, care has always been bound. Addiction and urge are possibilities \nrooted in the thrownness of Dasein. The urge 'to live' is not to be annihi\u00ad\nlated; the addiction to becoming 'lived' by the world is not to be rooted \nout. But because these are both grounded ontologically in care, and only \nbecause of this, they are both to be modified in an ontical and existentiell \nmanner by care-by care as something authentic. \nWith the expression 'care' we have in mind a basic existential-onto\u00ad\nlogical phenomenon, which all the same is not simple in its structure.

'Being-in-the-world' has the stamp of 'care', which \naccords with its Being. It gets the name \"homo\" not in consideration of its \nBeing but in relation to that of which it consists (humus). The decision as \nto wherein the 'primordial' Being of this creature is to be seen, is left to \nSaturn, 'Time'.vl Thus the pre-ontological characterization of man's \n199 \nessence expressed in this fable, has brought to view in advance the kind \nof Being which dominates his temporal sojourn in the world, and does so \nthrough and through. \nThe history of the signification of the ontical concept of 'care' permits \nus to see still further basic structures ofDasein. Burdach vu calls attention \nto a double meaning of the term 'cura' according to which it signifies not \nonly 'anxious exertion' but also 'carefulness' and 'devotedness' [\"Sorg\u00ad\nfalt\", \"Hingabe\"]. Thus Seneca writes in his last epistle (Ep. 124) : \n'Among the four existent Natures (trees, beasts, man, and God), the latter \ntwo, which alone are endowed with reason, are distinguished in that God \nis immortal while man is mortal. Now when it comes to these, the good \nof the one, namely God, is fulfilled by his Nature; but that of the other, \nman, is fulfilled by care (cura) : \"unius bonum natura perjicit, dei scilicet, \nalterius cura, hominis.\" \nMan's perfectio-his transformation into that which he can be in Being\u00ad\nfree for his ownmost possibilities (projection)-is 'accomplished' by 'care'. \nBut with equal primordiality 'care' determines what is basically specific \nin this entity, according to which it has been surrendered to the world \nof its concern (thrownness). In the 'double meaning' of 'care', what we \nhave in view is a single basic state in its essentially twofold structure of \nthrown projection. \nAs compared with this ontical interpretation, the existential-ontological \nInterpretation is not, let us say, merely an ontical generalization which is \ntheoretical in character. That would just mean that ontically all man's \nways of behaving are 'full of care' and are guided by his 'devotedness' to \ncorrespond strictly to the double quotation marks in Heidegger's version; some of these \nare not found in Burdach's translation, which, except for two entirely trivial changes, \nHeidegger has otherwise reproduced very accurately. (On Biicheler and Burdach, see \nHeidegger's note v, ad Joe.) Our translation is a compromise between Burdach and the \noriginal Latin. \n"

Our analysis ofDasein's disclosedness showed further that, with \nthis disclosedness, Dasein, in its basic state of Being-in-the-world, has been \nrevealed equiprimordially with regard to the world, Being-in, and the \nSelf. Furthermore, in the factical disclosedness of the world, entities \nwithin-the-world are discovered too. This implies that the Being of these \nentities is always understood in a certain manner, even if it is not conceived \nin a way which is appropriately ontological. To be sure, the pre-onto-\n201 \nlogical understanding of Being embraces all entities which are essentially \ndisclosed in Dasein ; but the understanding of Being has not yet Arti\u00ad\nculated itself in a way which corresponds to the various modes of Being. \nAt the same time our interpretation of understanding has shown that, \nin accordance with its falling kind ofBeing,-it has, proximally and for the \nmost part, diverted itself [sich \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n verlegt] into an understanding of the \n'world'. Even where the issue is not only one of ontical experience but \nalso one of ontological understanding, the interpretation of Being takes its \norientation in the first instance from the Being of entities within-the\u00ad\nworld. Thereby the Being of what is proximally ready-to-hand gets passed \nover, and entities are first conceived as a context ofThings (res) which are \npresent-at-hand. \"Being\" acquires the meaning of \"Realiry\".v111 Sub\u00ad\nstantiality becomes the basic characteristic of Being. Corresponding to this \nway in which the understanding of Being' has been diverted, even the \nontological understanding of Dasein moves into the horizon of this con\u00ad\nception of Being. Like any other entity, Dasein too is present-at-hand as Real. \nIn this way \"Being in general\" acquires the meaning of\"Realiry\". Accord\u00ad\ningly the concept of Reality has a peculiar priority in the ontological \nproblematic. By this priority the route to a genuine existential analytic \nofDasein gets diverted, and so too does our very view of the Being of what \nis proximally ready-to-hand within-the-world. It finally forces the general \nproblematic of Being into a direction that lies off the course. The other \nmodes of Being become defined negatively and privatively with regard to \nReality. \nThus not only the analytic ofDasein but the working-out of the question \nof the meaning of Being in general must be turned away from a one-sided \norientation with regard to Being in the sense of Reality. We must demon\u00ad\nstrate that Reality is not only one kind of Being among others, but that onto\u00ad\nlogically it has a definite connection in its foundations with Dasein, the \nworld, and readiness-to-hand. To demonstrate this we must discuss in \nprinciple the problem of Realiry, its conditions and its limits. \nUnder the heading 'problem of Reality' various questions are clustered : \n(I) whether any entities which supposedly 'transcend our consciousness' \n"

Our investigation requires a new approach. \nOur analysis takes its departure from the traditional conception of truth, \nand attempts to lay bare the ontological foundations of that conception \n(a). In terms of these foundations the primordial phenomenon of truth \nbecomes visible. We can then exhibit the way in which the traditional \nconception of truth has been derived from this phenomenon (b). Qur \ninvestigation will make it plain that to the question of the 'essence' 'of \ntruth, there belongs necessarily the question of the kind of Being which \ntruth possesses. Together with this we must clarify the ontological meaning \nof the kind of talk in which we say that 'there is truth', and we must \nalso clarify the kind of necessity with which 'we must presuppose' that \n'there is' truth (c). \n(a) The Traditional Conception of Truth, and its Ontological Foundations \nThere are three theses which characterize the way in which the essence \nof truth has been traditionally taken and the way it is supposed to have \nbeen first defined: (1) that the 'locus' of truth is assertion (judgment) ; \n(2) that the essence of truth lies in the 'agreement' of thV judgment with \nits object; (3) that Aristotle, the father of logic, not only has assigned \ntruth to the judgment as its primordial locus but has set going the defini\u00ad\ntion of \"truth\" as 'agreement' . 1  \nHere it is not our aim to provide a history of the concept of truth, which \ncould be presented only on the basis of a history of ontology. We shall \nintroduce our analytical discussions by alluding to some familiar matters. \nAristotle says that the 7TaO\u011fp,ara Tfj!; ifivxfj!; are TWV 7Tpayp,arwv op,oulJ\u00ad\np.araXXix_that the soul's 'Experiences', its vo\u011fp,ara ('representations'), \nare likenings of Things. This assertion, which is by no means proposed as \nan explicit definition of the essence of truth, has also given occasion for \ndeveloping the later formulation of the essence of truth ' as adaequatio \nintellectus et rei. 2 Thomas Aquinas,xxx who refers this definition to Avicenna \n(who, in turn, has taken it over from Isaac Israeli's tenth-century 'Book of \nDefinitions') also uses for \"adaequatio\" (likening) the terms \"correspondentia\" \n(\"correspondence\") and \"convenientia\" (\" coming together\"). \n1 Here we follow the older editions in reading ' . . .  hat sowohl die Wahrheit dem Urteil \nals ihrem urspriinglichen Ort zugewiesen als auch die Definition der Wahrheit als \n\"Ubereinstimmung\" in Gang gebracht.' The newer editions read ' .\n.\n\u2022\n hat sowohl \u2022\n.\n.\n \nzugewiesen, er hat auch . .  \n.' \n2 This is usually translated as 'adequation of the intellect and the thing'. Heidegger \nmakes the connection seem closer by translating both the Latin adaequatio and the Greek \nOJLolwp.a by the word 'Angleichung', which we have somewhat arbitrarily translated as \n'likening'. \n"

But Kant too adhered to this conception of truth, so much so \nthat he did not even bring it up for discussion; this has been overlooked, \nthough Brentano has already called our attenti<.n to it. 'The old and \ncelebrated question with which it was supposed that one might drive the \nlogicians into a corner is this: \"what is truth?\" The explanation of the \nname of truth-namely, that it is the agreement of knowledge with its \nobject-will here be granted and presupposed . .  ;xxt. \n'If truth consists in the agreement ofknowledge with its object, then this \nobject must thus be distinguished from others; for knowledge is false if it \ndoes not agree with the object to which it is related, even if it should \ncontain something which might well be valid for other objects.'xxU And \nin the introduction to the \"Transcendental Dialectic\" Kant states : 'Truth \nand illusion are not in the object so far as it is intuited, but in the judg\u00ad\nment about it so far as it is thought. \u2022xxtu \nOf course this characterization of truth as 'agreement', adaequatio, \nOJLolwcns, is very general and empty. Yet it will still have some justifica\u00ad\ntion if it can hold its own without prejudice to any of the most various \nInterpretations which that distinctive predicate \"knowledge\" will support. \nWe are now inquiring into the foundations of this 'relation'. What else is \ntacit(\u00bb posited in this relational totaliry of the adaequatio intellectus et rei? \nAnd what ontological character does that which is thus posited have itself? \nWhat in general does one have in view when one uses the term 'agree\u00ad\nment' ? The agreement of something with something has the formal \ncharacter of.a relation of something to something. Every agreement, and \ntherefore 'truth' as well, is a relation. But not every relation is an agree\u00ad\nment. A sign points at what is indicated.1 Such indicating is a relation, \nbut not an agreement of the sign with what is indicated. Yet manifestly \nnot every agreement is a convenientia of the kind that is fixed upon in the \ndefinition of \"truth\". The number \"6\" agrees with \"16 minus 10\". These \n2 16 \nnumbers agree; they are equal with regard to the question of \"how \nmuch ?\" Equality is one way of agreeing. Its structure is such that something \nlike a 'with-regard-to' belongs to it. In the adaequatio something gets \nrelated; what is that with regard to which it agrees ? In clarifying the \n'truth-relation' we must notice also what is peculiar to the terms of this \nrelation. With regard to what do intellectus and res agree ? In their kind of \nBeing and their essential content do they give us anything at all with \n1 'Ein Zeichen zeigt auf das Gezeigte.' \n"

Circumspective \nconcern, or even that concern in which we tarry and look at something, \nuncovers entities within-the-world. These entities become that which has \nbeen uncovered. They are 'true' in a second sense. What is primarily \n'true'-that is, uncovering-is Dasein. \"Truth\" in the second sense does \nnot mean Being-uncovering* (uncovering), but Being-uncovered (un\u00ad\ncoveredness). \nOur earlier analysis of the worldhood of the world and of entities within\u00ad\nthe-world has shown, however, that the uncoveredness of entities within\u00ad\nthe-world is grounrled in the world's disclosedness. But disclosedness is that \nbasic character ofDasein according to which it is its \"there\". Disclosedness \nis constituted by state-of-mind, understanding, and discourse, and pertains \nequiprimordially to the world, to Being-in, and to the Self. In its very \nstructure, care is . ahead of itself-Being already in a world-as Being \nalongside entities within-the-world; and in this structure the disclosedness \nof Dasein lies hidden. With and through it is uncoveredness;1 hence only \nwith Dasein's disclosedness is the most primordial phenomenon of truth \n22 1 \nattained. What we have pointed out earlier with regard to the existential \nConstitution of the \"there\"xxvii and in relation to the everyday Being \nof the \"there\" ,xxvm pertains to the most primordial phenomenon of \ntruth, nothing less. In so far as Dasein is its disclosedness essentially, and \ndiscloses and uncovers as something disclosed to this extent it is essen-\ntially 'true'. Dasein is 'in the truth'. This assertion has meaning ontologically. \nIt does not purport to say that ontically Dasein is introduced 'to all the \ntruth' either always or just in every case, but rather that the disclosedness \nof its ownmost Being belongs to its existential constitution. \nIf we accept the results we have obtained earlier, the full existential \nmeaning of the principle that 'Dasein is in the truth' can be restored by \nthe following considerations: \n1 'Mit und durch sie ist Entdecktheit . .  .' Our version reflects the ambiguity of the \nGerman, which leaves the grammatical function of the pronoun 'sie' obscure and permits \nit to refer either to 'the disclosedness of Dasein', to 'care', or-perhaps most likely-to \n'the structure of care'. \n"

To care belongs not only Being\u00ad\nin-the-world but also Being alongside entities within-the-world. The \nuncoveredness of such entities is equiprimordial with the Being of Dasein \nand its disclosedness. \n(2) To Dasein's state ofBeing belongs thrownness; indeed it is constitutive \nfor Dasein's disclosedness. In thrownness is revealed that in each case \nDasein, as my Dasein and this Dasein, is already in a definite world and \nalongside a definite range of definite entities within-the-world.1 Dis\u00ad\nclosedness is essentially factical. \n(3) To Dasein's state of Being belongs projection-disclosive Being to\u00ad\nwards its potentiality-for-Being. As something that understands, Dasein \ncan understand itself in terms of the 'world' and Others or in terms of its \nownmost potentiality-for-Being. 2 The possibility just mentioned means \nthat Dasein discloses itself to itself in and as its ownmost potentiality-for \nBeing. This authentic disclosedness shows the phenomenon of the most \nprimordial truth in the mode of authenticity. The most primordial, and \nindeed the most authentic, disclosedness in which Dasein, as a potent\u00ad\niality-for-Being, can be, is the truth of existence. This becomes existentially \nand ontologically definite only in connection with the analysis of Dasein's \nauthenticity. \n' \n(4) To Dasein's state of Being belongs falling. Proximally and for the \n222 \nmost part Dasein is lost in its 'world'. Its understanding, as a projection \nupon possibilities of Being, has diverted itself thither. Its absorption in the \n\"they\" signifies that it is dominated by the way things are publicly \ninterpreted. That which has been uncovered and disclosed stands in a \nmode in which it has been disguised and closed off by idle talk, curiosity, \nand ambiguity. Being towards entities has not been extinguished, but it \nhas been uprooted. Entities have not been completely hidden ; they are \nprecisely the sort of thing that has been uncovered, but at the same time \nthey have been disguised. They show themselves, but in the mode of \nsemblance. Likewise what has formerly been uncovered sinks back again, \nhidden and disguised. Because Dasein is essentially falling, its state of Being is \nsuch that it is in 'untruth'. This term, like the expression 'falling', is here \nused ontologically. If we are to use it in existential analysis, we must \n1 'In ihr enthiillt sich, dass Dasein je schon a1s meines und dieses in einer bestimmten \nWelt und bei einem bestimmten Umkreis von bestimmten innerweltlichen Seienden ist.' \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n der Entwurf: das erschliessende Sein zu seinem Seinkonnen. Dasein kann sich als \nverstehendes aus der \"Welt\" und den Anderen her verstehen oder aus seinem eigensten \nSeinkonnen.' The earlier editions have a full stop after 'Entwurf' rather than a colon, and \nintroduce 'das' with a capital. The grammatical function of 'als versteheodes' seems \nambiguous. \n"

In its full existential-ontological \nmeaning, the proposition that 'Dasein is in the truth' states equiprim\u00ad\nordially that 'Dasein is in untruth'. But only in so far as Dasein'has been \ndisclosed has it also been closed off; and only in so far as entities within\u00ad\nthe-world have been uncovered along with Dasein, have such entities, \nas possibly encounterable within-the-world, been covered up (hidden) or \ndisguised. \nIt is therefore essential that Dasein should explicitly appropriate what \nhas already been uncovered, defend it against semblance and disguise, and \nassure itself of its uncoveredness again and again. The uncovering of \nanything new is never done on the basis of having something completely \nhidden, but takes its departure rather from untoveredness in the mode of \nsemblance. Entities look as if \u2022\n.\n.\n That is, they have, in a certain way, \nbeen uncovered already, and yet they are still disguised. \nTruth (uncoveredness) is something that must always first be wrested \nfrom entities.
