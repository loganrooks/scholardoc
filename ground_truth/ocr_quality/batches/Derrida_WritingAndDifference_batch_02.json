And less so its force.\nYet: \u201cThe structural fact thus described\u2014the double register\u2014appears\nas a constant. . . . At the same time [my italics] it corresponds to the\nknowledge that Marivauldian man has of himself: a \u2018heart\u2019 without\nvision, caught in the \ufb01eld of a consciousness which itself is only\nvision\u201d (p. 64). But how can a \u201cstructural fact,\u201d traditional during this\nera (assuming that as it is de\ufb01ned, it is determined and original enough\nto belong to an era) \u201ccorrespond\u201d to the consciousness of\n\u201cMarivauldian man\u201d? Does the structure correspond to Marivaux\u2019s\nmost singular intention? Is Marivaux not, rather, a good example\u2014and it\nwould have to be demonstrated why he is a good example\u2014of a literary\nstructure of the times and, through it, an example of a structure of the\nera itself? Are there not here a thousand unresolved methodological\nproblems that are the prerequisites for a single structural study, a\nmonograph on an author or a work?\nIf geometrism is especially apparent in the essays on Corneille and\nMarivaux, preformationism triumphs \u00e0 propos of Proust and Claudel.\nAnd this time in a form that is more organicist than topographical. It is\nhere too, that preformationism is most fruitful and convincing. First,\nbecause it permits the mastering of a richer subject matter, penetrated\nmore from within. (May we be permitted to remark that we feel that\nwhat is best about this book is not due to its method, but to the quality\nof the attention given to its objects?) Further, because Proust\u2019s and\nClaudel\u2019s aesthetics are profoundly aligned with Rousset\u2019s.\nFor Proust himself and the demonstration given leaves no doubt on\nthis subject, if one still had any\u2014the demands of structure were con-\nstant and conscious, manifesting themselves through marvels of (nei-\nther true nor false) symmetry, recurrence, circularity, light thrown\nbackward, superimposition (without adequation) of the \ufb01rst and the\nlast, etc. Teleology here is not a product of the critic\u2019s projection, but is\nthe author\u2019s own theme. The implication of the end in the beginning,\nthe strange relationships between the subject who writes the book and\nthe subject of this book, between the consciousness of the narrator and\nthat of the hero\u2014all this recalls the style of becoming and the dialectic\nof the \u201cwe\u201d in the Phenomenology of the Mind.50 We are indeed concerned\nforce and signification\n25\n"

For example: after having\nbrought to light the necessity of repetition in Proustian composition,\nRousset writes: \u201cWhatever one thinks of the device which introduces\nUn amour de Swann, it is quickly forgotten, so tight and organic is the\nliaison that connects the part to the whole. Once one has \ufb01nished\nreading the Recherche, one perceives that the episode is not at all isolable;\nwithout it, the ensemble would be unintelligible. Un amour de Swann is a\nnovel within a novel, a painting within a painting . . ., it brings to mind,\nnot the stories within stories that so many seventeenth- or eighteenth-\ncentury novelists encase in their narratives, but rather the inner stories\nthat can be read the Vie de Marianne, in Balzac or Gide. At one of the\nentryways to his novel, Proust places a small convex mirror which\nre\ufb02ects the novel in abbreviated form\u201d (p. 146). The metaphor and\noperation of encasement impose themselves, even if they are \ufb01nally\nreplaced by a \ufb01ner, more adequate image which, at bottom, signi\ufb01es\nthe same relationship of implication. A re\ufb02ecting and representative\nkind of implication, this time.\nIt is for these same reasons that Rousset\u2019s aesthetic is aligned with\nClaudel\u2019s. Moreover, Proust\u2019s aesthetic is de\ufb01ned at the beginning of\nthe essay on Claudel. And the a\ufb03nities are evident, above and beyond\nall the di\ufb00erences. These a\ufb03nities are assembled in the theme of\n\u201cstructural monotony\u201d: \u201c\u2018And thinking once more about the mon-\notony of Vinteuil\u2019s works, I explained to Albertine that great writers\nhave created only a single work, or rather have refracted the same\nbeauty that they bring to the world through diverse elements\u2019\u201d\n(p. 171). Claudel: \u201c\u2018Le soulier de satin is T\u00eate d\u2019or in another form. It\nsummarizes both T\u00eate d\u2019or and Partage de midi. It is even the conclusion\nof Partage de midi . . . \u2019\u201d \u201c\u2018A poet does hardly anything but develop a\npreestablished plan\u2019\u201d (p. 172).\nThis aesthetic which neutralizes duration and force as the di\ufb00erence\nbetween the acorn and the oak, is not autonomously Proust\u2019s or\nClaudel\u2019s. It translates a metaphysics. Proust also calls \u201ctime in its pure\nstate\u201d the \u201catemporal\u201d or the \u201ceternal.\u201d The truth of time is not tem-\nporal. Analogously (analogously only), time as irreversible succession,\nis, according to Claudel, only the phenomenon, the epidermis, the\nsurface image of the essential truth of the universe as it is conceived\nforce and signification\n27\n"

That the aesthetics they govern can be\nlegitimately and fruitfully applied to the reading of Proust or Claudel is\nevident, for these are their aesthetics, daughter (or mother) of their\nmetaphysics. It is also readily demonstrable that what is in question is\nthe metaphysics implicit in all structuralism, or in every structuralist\nproposition. In particular, a structuralist reading, by its own activity,\nalways presupposes and appeals to the theological simultaneity of the\nbook, and considers itself deprived of the essential when this simul-\ntaneity is not accessible. Rousset: \u201cIn any event, reading, which is\ndeveloped in duration, will have to make the work simultaneously\npresent in all its parts in order to be global. . . . Similar to a \u2018painting in\nmovement,\u2019 the book is revealed only in successive fragments. The task\nof the demanding reader consists in overturning this natural tendency\nof the book, so that it may present itself in its entirety to the mind\u2019s\nscrutiny. The only complete reading is the one which transforms the\nbook into a simultaneous network of reciprocal relationships: it is then\nthat surprises emerge\u201d (p. xiii). (What surprises? How can simul-\ntaneity hold surprises in store? Rather, it neutralizes the surprises of\nnonsimultaneity. Surprises emerge from the dialogue between the\nsimultaneous and the nonsimultaneous. Which su\ufb03ces to say that\nstructural simultaneity itself serves to reassure.) Jean-Pierre Richard:\n\u201cThe di\ufb03culty of every structural account resides in that it must\ndescribe sequentially, successively, that which in fact exists all at once,\nsimultaneously\u201d (L\u2019univers imaginaire de Mallarm\u00e9, p. 28). Thus, Rousset\ninvokes the di\ufb03culty of gaining access to the simultaneity which is\ntruth within reading, and Richard the di\ufb03culty of accounting for it\nwriting and difference\n28\n"

But by\nsaying \u201csimultaneity\u201d instead of space, one attempts to concentrate time\ninstead of forgetting it. \u201cDuration thus takes on the illusory form of a\nhomogeneous milieu, and the union between these two terms, space and\nduration, is simultaneity, which could be de\ufb01ned as the intersection of\ntime with space.\u201d52 In this demand for the \ufb02at and the horizontal, what\nis intolerable for structuralism is indeed the richness implied by the\nvolume, every element of signi\ufb01cation that cannot be spread out into\nthe simultaneity of a form. But is it by chance that the book is, \ufb01rst and\nforemost, volume?53 And that the meaning of meaning (in the general\nsense of meaning and not in the sense of signalization) is in\ufb01nite\nimplication, the inde\ufb01nite referral of signi\ufb01er to signi\ufb01er?

To comprehend the\nstructure of a becoming, the form of a force, is to lose meaning by\n\ufb01nding it. The meaning of becoming and of force, by virtue of their\npure, intrinsic characteristics, is the repose of the beginning and the\nend, the peacefulness of a spectacle, horizon or face.56 Within this\npeace and repose the character of becoming and of force is disturbed\nby meaning itself. The meaning of meaning is Apollonian by virtue of\neverything within it that can be seen.57\nTo say that force is the origin of the phenomenon is to say nothing.\nBy its very articulation force becomes a phenomenon. Hegel demon-\nstrated convincingly that the explication of a phenomenon by a force is\na tautology.58 But in saying this, one must refer to language\u2019s peculiar\ninability to emerge from itself in order to articulate its origin, and not\nto the thought of force. Force is the other of language without which\nlanguage would not be what it is.\nIn order to respect this strange movement within language, in order\nnot to reduce it in turn, we would have to attempt a return to the\nmetaphor of darkness and light (of self-revelation and self-\nconcealment), the founding metaphor of Western philosophy as meta-\nphysics. The founding metaphor not only because it is a photological\none\u2014and in this respect the entire history of our philosophy is a pho-\ntology, the name given to a history of, or treatise on, light\u2014but because\nit is a metaphor.

In this passage madness, folly, dementia,\ninsanity seem, I emphasize seem, dismissed, excluded, and ostracized\nfrom the circle of philosophical dignity, denied entry to the philo-\nsopher\u2019s city, denied the right to philosophical consideration, ordered\naway from the bench as soon as summoned to it by Descartes\u2014this last\ntribunal of a Cogito that, by its essence, could not possibly be mad.\nIn alleging\u2014correctly or incorrectly, as will be determined\u2014that the\nsense of Foucault\u2019s entire project can be pinpointed in these few allu-\nsive and somewhat enigmatic pages, and that the reading of Descartes\nand the Cartesian Cogito proposed to us engages in its problematic the\ntotality of this History of Madness as regards both its intention and its\nfeasibility, I shall therefore be asking myself, in two series of questions,\nthe following:\n1. First, and in some ways this is a prejudicial question: is the inter-\npretation of Descartes\u2019s intention that is proposed to us justi\ufb01able? What\ncogito and the history of madness\n37\n"

Perhaps it does not su\ufb03ce to\nimprison or to exile the delegate, or to sti\ufb02e him; and perhaps it does\nnot su\ufb03ce to deny oneself the conceptual material of psychiatry in\norder to exculpate one\u2019s own language.

I would\nprefer dissension, to underline that in question is a self-dividing action, a\ncleavage and torment interior to meaning in general, interior to logos in\ngeneral, a divison within the very act of sentire. As always, the dissension\nis internal. The exterior (is) the interior, is the \ufb01ssion that produces and\ndivides it along the lines of the Hegelian Entzweiung.\nIt thus seems that the project of convoking the \ufb01rst dissension of\nlogos against itself is quite another project than the archaeology of\nsilence, and raises di\ufb00erent questions. This time it would be necessary\nto exhume the virgin and unitary ground upon which the decisive act\nlinking and separating madness and reason obscurely took root. The\nreason and madness of the classical age had a common root. But this\ncommon root, which is a logos, this unitary foundation is much more\nancient than the medieval period, brilliantly but brie\ufb02y evoked by\nFoucault in his very \ufb01ne opening chapter. There must be a founding\nunity that already carries within it the \u201cfree trade\u201d of the Middle Ages,\nand this unity is already the unity of a logos, that is, of a reason; an\nalready historical reason certainly, but a reason much less determined\nthan it will be in its so-called classical form, having not yet received the\ndeterminations of the \u201cclassical age.\u201d It is within the element of this\narchaic reason that the dissection, the dissension, will present itself as a\nmodi\ufb01cation or, if you will, as an overturning, that is, a revolution but\nan internal revolution, a revolution a\ufb00ecting the self, occurring within\nthe self.

In order to account simultaneously for the origin (or the\npossibility) of the decision and for the origin (or the possibility) of its\nnarration, it might have been necessary to start by re\ufb02ecting this ori-\nginal logos in which the violence of the classical era played itself out.\nThis history of logos before the Middle Ages and before the classical\nage is not, if this need be said at all, a nocturnal and mute prehistory.\nwriting and difference\n46\n"

It is bothersome because at the outset Foucault makes a some-\nwhat enigmatic allusion to the Greek logos, saying that, unlike classical\nreason, it \u201chad no contrary.\u201d To cite Foucault: \u201cThe Greeks had a\nrelation to something that they called hybris. This relation was not\nmerely one of condemnation; the existence of Thrasymacus or of Cal-\nlicles su\ufb03ces to prove it, even if their language has reached us already\nenveloped in the reassuring dialectic of Socrates. But the Greek Logos\nhad no contrary.\u201d8\n[One would have to assume, then, that the Greek logos had no\ncontrary, which is to say, brie\ufb02y, that the Greeks were in the greatest\nproximity to the elementary, primordial, and undivided Logos with\nrespect to which contradiction in general, all wars or polemics, could\nonly be ulterior developments. This hypothesis forces us to admit, as\nFoucault above all does not, that the history and lineage of the \u201creassur-\ning dialectic of Socrates\u201d in their totality had already fallen outside and\nbeen exiled from this Greek logos that had no contrary. For if the\nSocratic dialectic is reassuring, in the sense understood by Foucault, it\nis so only in that it has already expulsed, excluded, objecti\ufb01ed or (curi-\nously amounting to the same thing) assimilated and mastered as one of\nits moments, \u201cenveloped\u201d the contrary of reason; and also only in that\nit has tranquilized and reassured itself into a pre-Cartesian certainty, a\nsophrosyne, a wisdom, a reasonable good sense and prudence.\nConsequently, it must be either (a) that the Socratic moment and its\nentire posterity immediately partake in the Greek logos that has no\ncontrary; and that consequently, the Socratic dialectic could not be\nreassuring (we may soon have occasion to show that it is no more\nreassuring than the Cartesian cogito). In this case, in this hypothesis,\nthe fascination with the pre-Socratics to which we have been provoked\nby Nietzsche, then by Heidegger and several others, would carry with\nit a share of mysti\ufb01cation whose historico-philosophical motivations\ncogito and the history of madness\n47\n"

It would be essential\nto the entirety of the history of philosophy and of reason. In this\nregard, the classical age could have neither speci\ufb01city nor privilege.\nAnd all the signs assembled by Foucault under the chapter heading\nStultifera navis would play themselves out only on the surface of a chronic\ndissension. The free circulation of the mad, besides the fact that it is not\nas simply free as all that, would only be a socioeconomic epiphenom-\nenon on the surface of a reason divided against itself since the dawn of\nits Greek origin. What seems to me sure in any case, regardless of the\nhypothesis one chooses concerning what is doubtless only a false prob-\nlem and a false alternative, is that Foucault cannot simultaneously save the\na\ufb03rmation of a reassuring dialectic of Socrates and his postulation of a\nspeci\ufb01city of the classical age whose reason would reassure itself by\nexcluding its contrary, that is, by constituting its contrary as an object in\norder to be protected from it and be rid of it.

This is the heart of the matter. Permit\nme to hold o\ufb00 on this question.\nHowever one interprets the situation of classical reason, notably as\nregards the Greek logos (and whether or not this latter experienced\ndissension) in all cases a doctrine of tradition, of the tradition of logos (is\nthere any other?) seems to be the prerequisite implied by Foucault\u2019s\nenterprise.

The determination of their di\ufb00erence sup-\nposes a hazardous linguistic transition. The frequent imprudence of\ntranslators in this respect should make us very wary. I am thinking in\nparticular, and in passing, of what is translated by madness and fury in\nthe Philebus (45e).9 Further, if madness has an invariable meaning, what\nis the relation of this meaning to the a posteriori events which govern\nFoucault\u2019s analysis? For, despite everything, even if his method is not\nempiricist, Foucault proceeds by inquiry and inquest. What he is writ-\ning is a history, and the recourse to events, in the last resort, is\nindispensable and determining, at least in principle. Now, is not the\nconcept of madness\u2014never submitted to a thematic scrutiny by\nFoucault\u2014today a false and disintegrated concept, outside current and\npopular language which always lags longer than it should behind its\nsubversion by science and philosophy? Foucault, in rejecting the psy-\nchiatric or philosophical material that has always emprisoned the mad,\nwinds up employing\u2014inevitably\u2014a popular and equivocal notion of\nmadness, taken from an unveri\ufb01able source. This would not be serious\nif Foucault used the word only in quotation marks, as if it were the\nlanguage of others, of those who, during the period under study, used\nit as a historical instrument. But everything transpires as if Foucault\nknew what \u201cmadness\u201d means. Everything transpires as if, in a continu-\nous and underlying way, an assured and rigorous precomprehension of\nthe concept of madness, or at least of its nominal de\ufb01nition, were\npossible and acquired. In fact, however, it could be demonstrated that\nas Foucault intends it, if not as intended by the historical current he is\nstudying, the concept of madness overlaps everything that can be put\nunder the rubric of negativity. One can imagine the kind of problems\nposed by such a usage of the notion of madness. The same kind of\nquestions could be posed concerning the notion of truth that runs\nthroughout the book . . .

Let me cite the\npassage from Descartes that concerns us here:\nFor, as a matter of fact, painters, even when they study with the great-\nest skill to represent sirens and satyrs by forms the most strange and\nextraordinary, cannot give them natures which are entirely new, but\nmerely make a certain medley of the members of different animals; or\nif their imagination is extravagant enough to invent something so\nnovel that nothing similar has ever before been seen, and that then\ntheir work represents a thing purely \ufb01ctitious and absolutely false, it is\ncertain all the same that the colours of which this is composed are\nnecessarily real. And for the same reason, although these general\nthings, to wit, a body, eyes, a head, hands, and such like, may be\nimaginary, we are bound at the same time to confess that there are at\nleast some other objects yet more simple and more universal, which\nare real and true; and of these just in the same way as with certain real\ncolours, all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts,\nwhether true and real or false and fantastic, are formed.\nTo such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general, and\nits extension, the \ufb01gure of extended things, their quantity or magni-\ntude and number, as also the place in which they are, the time which\nmeasures their duration, and so on.\nThat is possibly why our reasoning is not unjust when we conclude\nfrom this that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine and all other sciences\nwhich have as their end the consideration of composite things, are\nvery dubious and uncertain; but that Arithmetic, Geometry and other\nsciences of that kind which only treat of things that are very simple and\nvery general, without taking great trouble to ascertain whether they are\nactually existent or not, contain some measure of certainty and an\nelement of the indubitable. For whether I am awake or asleep, two and\nthree together always form \ufb01ve, and the square can never have more\nthan four sides, and it does not seem possible that truths so clear and\napparent can be suspected of any falsity.13\ncogito and the history of madness\n59\n"

It is the \u201cbut perhaps\u201d of the feigned objection.\nDescartes has just said that all knowledge of sensory origin could\ndeceive him. He pretends to put to himself the astonished objection of\nan imaginary nonphilosopher who is frightened by such audacity and\nsays: no, not all sensory knowledge, for then you would be mad and it\nwould be unreasonable to follow the example of madmen, to put forth\nthe ideas of madmen. Descartes echoes this objection: since I am here,\nwriting, and you understand me, I am not mad, nor are you, and we\nare all sane. The example of madness is therefore not indicative of the\nfragility of the sensory idea. So be it. Descartes acquiesces to this nat-\nural point of view, or rather he feigns to rest in this natural comfort in\norder better, more radically and more de\ufb01nitively, to unsettle himself\nfrom it and to discomfort his interlocutor. So be it, he says, you think\nthat I would be mad to doubt that I am sitting near the \ufb01re, etc., that I\nwould be insane to follow the example of madmen. I will therefore\npropose a hypothesis which will seem much more natural to you, will\nnot disorient you, because it concerns a more common, and more\nuniversal experience than that of madness: the experience of sleep and\ndreams. Descartes then elaborates the hypothesis that will ruin all the\nsensory foundations of knowledge and will lay bare only the intellectual\nfoundations of certainty. This hypothesis above all will not run from\nthe possibility of an insanity\u2014an epistemological one\u2014much more\nserious than madness.\nThe reference to dreams is therefore not put o\ufb00 to one side\u2014quite\nthe contrary\u2014in relation to a madness potentially respected or even\nexcluded by Descartes. It constitutes, in the methodical order which\nhere is ours, the hyperbolical exasperation of the hypothesis of mad-\nness. This latter a\ufb00ected only certain areas of sensory perception, and in\na contingent and partial way. Moreover, Descartes is concerned here\nnot with determining the concept of madness but with utilizing the\npopular notion of insanity for juridical and methodological ends, in\norder to ask questions of principle regarding only the truth of ideas.15\nWhat must be grasped here is that from this point of view the sleeper, or the\ndreamer, is madder than the madman.

He would\neven, in the long run, be condemned to construe it, like all errors, not\nonly as an epistemological de\ufb01ciency but also as a moral failure linked\nto a precipitation of the will; for will alone can consecrate the intel-\nlectual \ufb01nitude of perception as error. It is only one step from here to\nmaking madness a sin, a step that was soon after cheerfully taken, as\nFoucault convincingly demonstrates in other chapters.\nFoucault would be perfectly correct in recalling these two truths to\nus if we were to remain at the na\u00efve, natural, and premetaphysical stage\nof Descartes\u2019s itinerary, the stage marked by natural doubt as it inter-\nvenes in the passage that Foucault cites. However, it seems that these\ntwo truths become vulnerable in turn, as soon as we come to the\nproperly philosophical, metaphysical, and critical phase of doubt.16\nLet us \ufb01rst notice how, in the rhetoric of the \ufb01rst Meditation, the \ufb01rst\ntoutefois [at the same time] which announced the \u201cnatural\u201d hyperbole of\ndreams (just after Descartes says, \u201cBut they are mad, and I should not\nbe any the less insane,\u201d etc.) is succeeded by a second toutefois [never-\ntheless] at the beginning of the next paragraph.17 To \u201cat the same\ntime,\u201d marking the hyperbolical moment within natural doubt, will correspond\na \u201cnevertheless,\u201d marking the absolutely hyperbolical moment which gets us\nout of natural doubt and leads to the hypothesis of the evil genius.\nDescartes has just admitted that arithmetic, geometry, and simple\nnotions escape the \ufb01rst doubt, and he writes, \u201cNevertheless I have long\nhad \ufb01xed in my mind the belief that an all-powerful God existed by\nwhom I have been created such as I am.\u201d18 This is the onset of the\nwell-known movement leading to the \ufb01ction of the evil genius.\nNow, the recourse to the \ufb01ction of the evil genius will evoke,\nconjure up, the possibility of a total madness, a total derangement over\nwhich I could have no control because it is in\ufb02icted upon me\u2014\nhypothetically\u2014leaving me no responsibility for it.

A menace to all knowledge, insanity\u2014the hypothesis of\ninsanity\u2014is not an internal modi\ufb01cation of knowledge. At no point will\nknowledge alone be able to dominate madness, to master it in order to\nobjectify it\u2014at least for as long as doubt remains unresolved. For the\nend of doubt poses a problem to which we shall return in a moment.\nThe act of the Cogito and the certainty of existing indeed escape\nmadness the \ufb01rst time; but aside from the fact that for the \ufb01rst time, it is\nno longer a question of objective, representative knowledge, it can no\nlonger literally be said that the Cogito would escape madness because it\nkeeps itself beyond the grasp of madness, or because, as Foucault says,\n\u201cI who think, I cannot be mad\u201d; the Cogito escapes madness only\nbecause at its own moment, under its own authority, it is valid even if I\nam mad, even if my thoughts are completely mad. There is a value and a\nmeaning of the Cogito, as of existence, which escape the alternative of\na determined madness or a determined reason. Confronted with the\ncritical experience of the Cogito, insanity, as stated in the Discourse on\nMethod, is irremediably on a plane with scepticism. Thought no longer\nfears madness: \u201c . . . remarking that this truth \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019 was\nso certain and so assured that all the most extravagant suppositions\nbrought forward by the sceptics were incapable of shaking it.\u201d23 The\ncertainty thus attained need not be sheltered from an emprisoned\nmadness, for it is attained and ascertained within madness itself. It is\nvalid even if I am mad\u2014a supreme self-con\ufb01dence that seems to require\nneither the exclusion nor the circumventing of madness. Descartes\nnever interns madness, neither at the stage of natural doubt nor at the\nstage of metaphysical doubt. He only claims to exclude it during the \ufb01rst phase of\nthe \ufb01rst stage, during the nonhyperbolical moment of natural doubt.\nThe hyperbolical audacity of the Cartesian Cogito, its mad audacity,\nwhich we perhaps no longer perceive as such because, unlike Des-\ncartes\u2019s contemporary, we are too well assured of ourselves and too\nwell accustomed to the framework of the Cogito, rather than to the\ncritical experience of it\u2014its mad audacity would consist in the return to\ncogito and the history of madness\n67\n"

This identi\ufb01cation inter-\nvenes from the moment when Descartes determines natural light (which in\nits undetermined source should be valid even for the mad), from the\nmoment when he pulls himself out of madness by determining natural\nlight through a series of principles and axioms (axiom of causality\naccording to which there must be at least as much reality in the cause\nas in the e\ufb00ect; then, after this axiom permits the proof of the existence\nof God, the axioms that \u201cthe light of nature teaches us that fraud and\ndeception necessarily proceed from some defect\u201d).29 These dogmatic-\nally determined axioms escape doubt, are never even submitted to its\nscrutiny, are established only reciprocally, on the basis of the existence\nand truthfulness of God. Due to this fact, they fall within the province\nof the history of knowledge and the determined structures of phil-\nosophy.

And philosophy is perhaps the\nreassurance given against the anguish of being mad at the point of\ngreatest proximity to madness. This silent and speci\ufb01c moment could\nbe called pathetic. As for the functioning of the hyperbole in the struc-\nture of Descartes\u2019s discourse and in the order of reasons, our reading is\ntherefore, despite all appearances to the contrary, profoundly aligned\nwith Foucault\u2019s.

And in truth,\nHusserl increasingly associated the theme of normality with the theme\nof the transcendental reduction.
