It goes: \n[If I consider the sequence of representations as onlyb a process in the subject, in \naccordance with laws of association, then] all that I could say would be: Ifl support \na body, I feel an impression of weight; I could not say: It, the body, is heavy. Thus \u00b7 \nto say that the body is heavy is not merely to state that the two representations have \nbeen conjoined in my perception (however often that perception be repeated), but \nto say that these two representations are connected in the object, i.e., irrespective \nof the state of the subject. \nAccording to Kant's interpretation of the \"is,\" there speaks in it a con\u00ad\nnecting of subject and predicate of the sentence in the object. Every con\u00ad\nnecting brings with itself a unity with which and into which it connects \nthe given manifold. If, however, the unity cannot first arise from the con\u00ad\nnecting, because the connecting remains dependent from the outset upon \nthe unity, then where does the unity come from? According to Kant it is \n\"to be sought higher up,\" above the positing that connects by way of the \nunderstanding. It is that fv (uniting unity) which lets all the o\u2022)v (together) \nof every Oto\nc:; (positing) arise in the first place. [z88] Kant therefore cals \nit \"the originally synthetic unity.\" From the outset it is already present \n(adest) in all representation, in perception. It is the unity of the original \nsynthesis of apperception. Because it makes possible the being of beings, \nor in Kantian terms, the objectivity of the object, it lies higher, beyond the \nobject. Because it makes possible the object [Gegenstand] as such, it is called \n\"transcendental apperception.\" At the end of \u00a7 1 5 (B 1 3 1) Kant says of it \nthat it \nitself contains the ground of the unity of diverse concepts in judgment, and therefore \n[the ground) of the possibility of the understanding, even as regards its logical \nemployment. \nWhile Kant in his precritical work is still content with the view that \nbeing and existence cannot be further explained in their relationship to the \n\u2022 First edition, 1 963: Unthought: propriating usage [bratKhmJ)s Eignm). \nh First edition, 1963: \"Only\": the subjective as initially given. \n"

This A6yoc; holds \"al \nlogic\" in its custody. \nKant gives the name transcendental philosophy to the ontology that, as a \nresult of the transformation effected by the Critique ofPure Reason, considers \nthe being of beings as the objectivity of the [290] object of experience. \nTranscendental philosophy has its ground in logic. The logic, however, is no \nlonger formal logic, but the logic determined by the original synthetic unity \nof transcendental apperception. In such logic ontology is grounded. This \nconfirms what we have already said: Being and existence are determined by \ntheir relationship to the use of the understanding. \nEven now the main title for the interpretation of the being of beings is \nstill: \"Being and Thought.\" But the legitimate use of the understanding \ndepends on the following: that thinking continues to be specified as repre\u00ad\nsentational thinking that posits and judges - i.e., as positing and proposition \nby virtue of transcendental apperception, and that thinking remains related \nto affection by the senses. Thinking is ensconced in human subjectivity, \nwhich is affected by sensibility, i.e., is finite. \"I think\" means: I connect \na sensuously given manifold of representations by virtue of a prior glance \ntoward the unity of apperception, which articulates itself into the limited \nmultiplicity of pure concepts of the understanding, i.e., categories. \nAt one with the critical unfolding of the essence of the understanding \nis the limitation of its use, namely, its being limited to the determination \nof that which is given through sensuous intuition and its pure forms. Con\u00ad\nversely, the restriction of the use of the understanding to experience opens \nthe way at the same time to a more primordial determination of the essence \nof the understanding itself. What is posited in positing is what is posited \nof a given, which, for its part, becomes for the positing, by means of such \npositing and placing, something placed opposite and standing over against \nus, something thrown over against us [Entgegengewoifenen], i.e., an object \n(Oijekt]. The positedness (positing), i.e., being, changes into objecmess \n[Gegenstiindigkeit]. Even though Kant still speaks of\"things\" in the Critique \nof Pure Reason, as, for example, in the affirmative assertion of his thesis on \nbeing, \"thing\" always means: Gegen-stand, ob-ject in the broadest sense of \nsomething represented, of an \"X.\" Accordingly, Kant says in the Preface to \nthe second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (B XXVI) that the critique \n[291] \"teaches that the object is to be taken in a twofold sense, namely as \nappearance and as thing in itself.\" \n350 \n"

Whatever in general the pure understand\u00ad\ning, i.e., without relation to sensibility, represents, but does not and canot \nknow, serves as the X that is only thought of as underlying the appearing \nobject. The noumenon in the positive sense, i.e., the nonsensuous object \nintended as in itself, e.g., God, remains closed to our theoretical cognition \nsince we have at our disposal no nonsensuous intuition for which the object \nin itself could be immediately present. \nThe Critique does not abandon the detennination of being as posit\u00ad\ning nor even the concept of being in general. It is therefore an error of \nNeo-K.antianism, still being felt today, to say that through Kant's philoso\u00ad\nphy the concept of being is, as one says, \"resolved.\" The age-old prevailing \nmeaning of being (constant presence) not only is preserved in Kant's crit\u00ad\nical interpretation of being as the abjectness of the object of experience, \nbut even reappears in an exceptional form in the definition of \"abjectnes,\" \nwhile the interpretation of being as the substantiality of substance, which \notherwise prevails in the history of philosophy, virtually covers it up or \neven disguises it. Kant, however, defines \"substantial\" entirely in the sense \nof the critical interpretation of being as objeCbless: The substantial means \nnothing other \nthan the concept of object in general, which subsists in so far as we think in it merely \nthe transcendental subject apan from all predicates. (A 414.

Nevertheless, we are already \nprepared for a first understanding, and this, indeed, by means of that which \nKant explains about being in the negative assertion of his thesis: \"Being \nis obviously not a real predicate.\" This means: Being, and therefore also \nthe modes of being - being possible, being actual, being necessary - do not \nsay anything about what the Gegenstand, the object, is, but rather about \nbow the object is related to the subject. With respect to this \"how\" the \nso-called concepts of being are called \"modalities.\" Kant himself begins his \nclarification of the \"postulates\" with the following statement: \nThe categories of modality have the peculiarity that, in determining an object, they \ndo not in the least enlarge the concept [namely, that of the subject of the sentence] \nto which they are attached as predicates. They only express the relation to our \nfaculty of cognition. (A 219, B z66) \nOnce again let us note: Kant now no longer explains being and exis\u00ad\ntence in terms of the relation to the faculty of urulermJing but rather \nin terms of the relationship to the faculty of cognition, i.e., of course, to \nthe understanding, to the power of judgment, but in such a way that this \nlatter gets its determination through its relation to experience (sensation). \nBeing, to be sure, remains position, but drawn into the relationship to affec\u00ad\ntion. In the predicates of being possible, being actual, and being necesary \nthere lies a \"determination of the object\" - only, however, a \"certain\" de\u00ad\ntermination, insofar as something is stated about the object in itself, about \nit as object - namely, with regard to its objectivity, i.e., its standing-over\u00ad\nagainst-ness [Gegmrtindigkeit], with regard to the existence peculiar to it, \nbut not with regard to its reality, i.e., its substantiality [Sacbbeit]. For the \ncritical-transcendental interpretation of the being of beings, the precritical \nthesis that being is \"not a predicate at all\" is no longer valid. Being, as be\u00ad\ning possible, being actual, being necessary, is not, to be sure, a real (ontic) \npredicate, but it is a transcendental (ontological) predicate. \n[295] Now for the first time we understand the initially strange word\u00ad\ning that Kant uses in the affirmative assertion of his thesis in the text of \nthe Critique of Pure Reason: \"Being . . . is merely the positing of a thing \nor of cenain determinations in and of themselves.\" \"Thing\" means now, \naccording to the language of the Critique, object or Gegenstand.

The \ntitle \"Being_a_n\u04a0_Thought\" s_!tys1 being and thought are i\u04a1entical. As if it \nwere decided what identical means, as if the sense of identity lay at hand, \nand in particular, lay at hand right here in this distinctive \"case\" in respect \nof the relation between being and thought. Both are obviously nothing \nlike things or objects between which one might, unchallenged, calculate \nthis way or that. In no case does \"identical\" mean the same as \"equal.\" \nBeing and thought: [305] in this \"and\" lies concealed that which is worthy \nof thought, both for philosophy up to now and for present-day thinking. \nBut the presentation of the Kantian thesis has shown that being as posit\u00ad\ning is determined in terms of its relationship to the empirical use of the \nunderstanding. The \"and\" in the tide suggests this relationship, which, \naccording to Kant, has its foothold in thinking, i.e., in an activity of the \nhuman subject. \nOf what sort is this relationship? The characterization of thinking as \nreflection of reflection gives us a hint, even if only an approximate, not \nto say misleading, one. Thought plays a double role: in the first place as \nreflection and then as reflection of reflection. But what does all this mean? \nGiven the assumption that the characterization of thinking as reflection \nsuffices to specify the relation to being, then this means that thinking as \nsimple positing provides the horizon within which such qualities as posit\u00ad\nedness and objectivity can be seen. The function of thought is to provide a \nhorizon for the elucidation of being and of its modalities as positing. \nThinking as reflection of reflection means, on the other hand, the pro\u00ad\ncess whereby, and also the instrument and organon wherewith, being as \nglimpsed in the horiwn of positedness is interpreted. Thinking as re\u00ad\nflection means the horiwn, thinking as reflection of reflection means the \norganon for the interpretation of the being of beings. In the tide \"Being and \nThought,\" thinking remains essentially ambiguous in the indicated sense, \nand this holds for the entire history of Western thought. \nBut how would it be, now, if we take being in the sense of originary Greek \nthought, as the self-clearing and enduring presence of that which is for a \nwhile, not only and not in the first instance as positedness in being posited \n"

One thrives \non the erroneous opinion that ontology as the question concerning the be\u00ad\ning of beings means a \"realistic\" (naive or critical) \"attitude\" as opposed to an \n\"idealistic\" one. Ontological problematic has so little to do with \"realism\" that \nprecisely Kant, in and through his transcendental way of questioning, was able \nto accomplish the first decisive step since Plato and Aristotle toward explicitly \nlaying the ground for ontology. Defending the \"reality of the outer world\" is \nnot yet an ontological orientation. \"Ontological\" - taken in its popular philo\u00ad\nsophical meaning - means, however (and this betrays the hopeless confusion), \n, t something that must instead be called ontic, i.e., a stance that lets beings in \n\u00b7 themselves be what and how they are.

(z) In what manner \nmust the essence of Weltanschauung be delimited in general and grounded in \nterms of its intrinsic possibility with respect to the transcendence of Dasein? \n(3) How, in accordance with its transcendental character, does Weltanschauung \nrelate to philosophy? \n59 If indeed one identifies the ontic contexture of items of utility, or equipment, \nwith world and interprets being-in-the-world as dealing with items of utility, \nthen there is certainly no prospect of any understanding of transcendence as \nbeing-in-the-world in the sense of a \"fundamental constitution of Dasein.\" \nThe ontological structure of beings in our \"environing world\" - insofar as \nthey are discovered as equipment - does, however, have the advantage, in terms \nof an initial charaaerization of the phenomenon of world, of leading over into \nan analysis of this phenomenon3 and of preparing the transcendental problem \nof world. And this is also the sole intent - an intent indicated clearly enough \nin the structuring and layout of\u00a7\u00a7 14-24 of Being and T111e - of the analysis of \nthe environing world, an analysis that as a whole, and considered with regard \nto the leading goal, remains of subordinate significance. \nYet if nature is apparently missing - not only nature as an object of natural \nscience, but also nature in an originary sense (cf. Being and T111e, p. 65 below) -\nin this orientation of the analytic of Dasein, then there are reasons for this. \nThe decisive reason lies in the fact that nature does not let itself be encoun\u00ad\ntered either within the sphere of the environing world, nor in general primarily \nas something tuward which we co1nport ourselves. Nature is originarily mani\u00ad\nfest in Dasein through Dasein's existing as finding itself attuned in the 1nidst of \nbeings. But insofar as finding oneself [Befindlichluit] (thrownness) belongs to \nthe essence of Dasein, and comes to be expressed in the unity of the full con\u00ad\ncept of care, it is only here that the basis for the problem of nature can first be \nattained. \n6o The German zeitigm is used in Being and Ti11e to designate the \"temporalizing\" \nof Dasein as ecstatic temporality. Its more conventional usage implies mat\u00ad\nuration, flourishing, arising. Thus, the present usage suggests that Dasein's \nselfhood first comes into being in and through a temporalizing.

Presumably, \nhowever, the elucidation of transcendence first achieves an athquate conetpt of \nDastin, and with respect to this being it can then be oslred how things stand \nontologically concerning the relation of Dasein to God. \n63 Republic VI, 509 B. \n64 This parenthetical addition is not found in the first edition of Wtgm-lren. \n(Ii\u00b7ans.) \n6; Ibid., 509 A. \n66 Here we may be permitted to point out that what has been published so far \nof the investigations on \"Being and Time\" has no other task than that of a \nconcrete projection unveiling transctndmce (cf. \u00a7\u00a7 1 2.-83; especially \u00a769). This \nin tum occurs for the purpose of enabling the sole guiding intention, clearly \nindicated in the title of the wholt of Part I, of attaining the \"trtmScrndmtal hori\u00ad\nzon of the question concerning being.\" All concrete interpretations, above all \nthat of time, are to be evaluated solely in the perspective of rnobling the question \nof being. They have as little to do with modem \"dialectical theology\" as with \nmedieval Scholasticism. \nIf Dasein is here interpreted as that being that in general can pose such a \nthing as a problem of being as belonging to its existence, then this does not mean \nthat this being, which os Dosein can exist authentically and inauthentically, is the \n\"authentic\" being in general among all other beings, so that the latter would be \nonly a shadow of the former. Quite on the contrary, the illumination of tran\u00ad\nscendence is meant to attain that horizon within which the concept of being -\nincluding the \"natural\" concept that is often appealed to - can first be philo\u00ad\nsophically grounded os a concept. Ontological interpretation of being in and \nfrom out of the transcendence of Dasein does not, however, mean on tic deriva\u00ad\ntion of the sum-total of non-Dasein-like beings from this being qua Dasein. \nAs regards the reproach - which is connected with such misinterpretation -\nof an \"anthropocentric standpoint\" in Being and Ttme, this objection that is now \npassed all too readily from hand to hand says nothing so long as one omits to \nthink through the approach, the entire thrust, and the goal of the development \nof the problem in Being and Ttme and to comprehend how, precisely through \nthe elaboration of the transcendence of Dasein, \"the human being\" comes into \nthe \"center\" in such a way that his nothingness amid beings as a whole can and \nmust become a problem in the first place. \\Vhat dangers are entailed, then, by \nan \"anthropocentric standpoint\" that precisely puts its entire effort solely into \nshowing that the eSJence of Dasein that there stands \"at the center\" is ecstatic, \ni.e., \"excentric, \" yet that therefore, in addition, the alleged freedom from any \nstandpoint, which is contrary to the entire meaning of philosophizing as an es\u00ad\nsentially ji11itt possibility of existing, is a delusion? Cf. here the interpretation \nof the ecstaric-horizonal structure of time as temporality in Bei11g a11d Time, \nPart I, pp. J I6-4Jtl. \n67 In the present investigation, the Temporal (temporale] interpretation of tran\u00ad\nscendence is intentionally set aside throughout. \nfill The first edition of WegmarJ:m simpl}' reads: \"as a being\" (als Seimdes), rather \nthan \"as the heing that it is\" (tlls das Seimde, dns es ist).

Because \nmodem usage often employs \"work\" and \"labor\" indiscriminately, however, \nespecially with regard to the factory \"worker,\" I have retained the latter tenn \nthroughout. (Trans.) \n4 The German Wesm, generally rendered as \"esence,\" traditionally has the nom\u00ad\ninal sense of essmtil, referring to the fundamental \"whatness\" or primary \"sub\u00ad\nstance\" of something. For Heidegger, the word Wesm carries the verbal and \ntemporal sense of being (Sem) as the essential unfolding and enduring presenc\u00ad\ning (An-wesm) of something. (Trans.) \n5 \nGe-SteD (sometimes written GesteO) is the tenn by which Heidegger designates \nthe \"essence\" of modem technology. It is often translated as \"en framing.\" See \nthe essay \"Die Frage nach der Tecbnik\" for further details (Vortrage tmd Aufiatu \n[5th ed.] [Pfullingen: Neske, 1985], pp. 9-40). [Translated as \"The Question \nconcerning Technology,\" in Martin Heidegger: The Question concerning Technol\u00ad\nogy and Other Esays, trans. William Lovitt (New York: Harper & Row, 1977), \nPP\u00b7 3-35.] (Trans.) \n6 The phrase Verwmdung der Metlpbysik is difficult to render into English. \nHeidegger uses the word Verwmdung to suggest something other than a straight\u00ad\nforward \"overcoming\" (Uberwindung) that would be accomplished by human \nbeings (or by human thinking as subjectivity), and that would simply leave \nbehind it whatever is \"overcome.\" Verwindung implies recovery in the sense \nthat metaphysics itself, in its \"essence,\" recovers from the oblivion of its own \nessence. As Heidegger goes on to clarify, it is not therefore to be taken as \nimplying that human beings recover from metaphysics; nor is it human beings \nin the first instance who \"recover\" metaphysics in the sense of \"retrieving\" \nits essence. In the phrase \"recovery of metaphysics,\" metaphysics is itself the \n\"subject\" of the genitive. Elsewhere, Heidegger explains that the Verwindung \nof the \"essence of technology\" in the direction of its as yet concealed truth \"is \nsimilar to what happens when, in the human realm, one recovers from grief \nor pain.\" See Die Kehre (1949), Gesamtausgahe, vol. 79, p. 69 (translated by \nWilliam Lovitt as \"The Turning,\" in The Question concerning Tecbnowgy, p. 39). \nVerwmdung does, therefore, imply an \"overcoming,\" but what is overcome is \nnot left behind or escaped. (Trans.) \n7 The first edition of Wegmarkm simply reads: \"a surpassing of beings as such,\" \n(der Uberstieg iiher das Seiende als sokhes). (Trans.) \n8 \nIn what follows, Heidegger plays on the literal sense of the German es gibt, \"it \ngives.\" The phrase also carries its ordinary meaning, \"there is.\" (Trans.) \nHegel a11d the Greelts \nEdited and revised by John Sallis and William McNeill. \nz \nThe phrase \"through which the latter reaches completion\" (durr:h welches dims \nsich voOmdet) does not appear in the first edition of Wegmarken.

In this regard, cf. \nthe Foreword to the third edition (1915) of Jaspers's Psychology of Worldviws, \nwhich without naming names provides a response to Heidegger's critical review: \nThis new edition is an unaltered reprint of the second edition. Allow me to make a few \npurely personal comments as to why a revised edition would be difficult. \nThe result would be a new bok. In representing worldviews as moments or di\u00ad\nmensions of the one true worldview, which comprehends the whole only vaguely and \nnever explicidy, I anempted at that time to formulate all this on the basis of intuition, \nand to communicate it to my readers without any second thoughts. The particulars \nof what was presented in this manner still seem to me today to be true. I would be \nunable to do it bener today. I could only do it differendy. Following this first endeavor \nthat used an immediate, intuitive approach, I have for quite some time been concerned \nwith the methodological issue of venturing the second step of providing a logically \nprecise elucidation of our modem consciousnes of existence. Therefore, allowing my \nyouthful undertaking to remain in its original form would seem to be the more natural \nthing to do. Without my being aware of it or wishing it at the time, my whole approach \nin the bok and my method of analysis expressed a hidden ideal. I fully acknowledge \nthis, now that I have become aware of it. However, the limits found in the nature of this \nkind of presentation demand that the same content should appear in different forms. I \nam presendy endeavoring to come up with a new form, and the wrong way to do this \nwould be to revise what has already been published. In my subsequent work, I have \nbecome a different person not in my cast of mind, but rather in the realm of knowledge \nand logical form. And I would rather leave m}' earlier work untouched in the hope that, \nafter this first anempt to provide a psychological explanation and foundation for philo\u00ad\nsophical existence, I will also be able to be present a logically systematic clarification \nand foundation. \nAnother possible result of a revised edition would be damage to the bok. Since \nthe hook has ce\"ain flaws (in its arrangement, methodical comments, and historical \ndigressions, i.e., in maners that should be considered unessential with rt.'spect to the \npurpose of the bok), I would want to correct these in a revised edition, taking advantage \nof my present insights into the bok. Pages and sentences that are weak could be deleted, \na lnt of the terminology could be altered, and above all lacunae could be filled and the \nsystemati<.'S of the whole bok could be rearranged without affecting the particulars. \n379 \n"

Here it takes the early form of the question concerning the \nmeaning of the being of the \"I am\" (existence, Dasein) as distinct from the \nmeaning of being found in the \"something is something\" that belongs to \nobjectifying thinking. \nThe essays have been newly ordered in accordance with the chronolog\u00ad\nical principle of when they were written.

      "full_text": "EDITOR'S POSTSCRIPT TO THE GERMAN EDITION \nwhich Heidegger earlier had designated using the Kantian term \"overturn\u00ad\ning\" [UmkippungJ. These notes often grant us a sudden insight into the \nmovement of a thinking that turns. In a third group of marginal remarks, \nHeidegger looks back from his later position at what was thought at an \nearlier stop on t'he same path, in order to point to the substantive connec\u00ad\ntion between his current and his earlier positions. All marginalia that speak \nfrom the perspective of the \"event\" [EreignisJ arose only after 1936, when \nthis word became for Heidegger the guiding word of his thinking. \nMy sincere thanks are due to Hartmut Tietjen (cand. phil.) and to \nMurray Miles (cand. phil.) for their careful assistance with corrections. \nFriedrich-Wilhelm von Htrm11n \nFreiburg im Breisgau, July 1976 \n"
