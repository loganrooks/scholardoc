To say: this (this painting or these shoes) is due to [revient \nd] X, comes down to [revient d] saying: it is due to me, via the \ndetour of the \"it is due to (a) me.\" Not only: it is properly due to \nsuch -and -such, man or woman, to the male or female wearer (\" Die \nBauerin auf dem Acker tragt die Schuhe . . . .

A demonstration to be \nfollowed up, for let us have no doubt about this, in this restitution \ntrial, it's also a question of the shoes, or even the clogs, and going \nonly a little further back for the moment, of the feet of two \nillustrious Western professors, neither more nor less. \n- It's certainly a question of feet and of many other things, \nalways supposing that feet are something, and something iden\u00ad\ntifiable with itself.

The picture dates from 1 887 (F. 333). \n- Let's go back to before the allusion to the \"famous picture,\" \nto the point where the chapter \"Thing and Work\" names \"the \nfundamental Greek experience of the Being of beings in general.\" \nI emphasize fundamental (Grunderfahrung). The interpretation \nof the thing as hypokeimenon and then as subjectum does not \nonly produce (itself as) a slight linguistic phenomenon. The trans\u00ad\nforming translation of hypokeimenon as subjectum corresponds, \naccording to Heidegger, to another \"mode of thought\" and of being\u00ad\nthere. It translates, transports, transfers (Heidegger emphasizes \nthe passage implied in iiber) over and beyond the aforementioned \nfundamental Greek experience: \"Roman thought takes over \n(iibernimmt) the Greek words ( Warter) without the corresponding \nco-originary experience of what they say, without the Greek word \n"

A fair number of difficulties arise from \nwhat is translated by illustration. In his protocol, Schapiro uses \nthis word which also translates [into French] \"bildliche Darstel\u00ad\nlung\" (\"For this purpose an illustration suffices. We choose for \nthis a famous picture by Van Gogh . . .  \n/ 1) . Schapiro opens his text\u00ad\nand The Origin- at this point (by what right? )  and he writes: \"In \nhis essay on The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger \ninterprets a painting by Van Gogh to illustrate the nature of art \nas a disclosure of truth. \n\"He comes to this picture in the course of distinguishing three \nmodes of being: of useful artifacts [products], of natural things, \nand of works of fine art. He proposes to describe first, 'without \nany philosophical theory . . .  a familiar sort of equipment [Zeug: \nproduct]-a pair of peasant shoes'; and 'to facilitate the visual \nrealization [translating Veranschaulichung, intuitive sensory pre\u00ad\nsentation] of them' he chooses 'a well-known painting by Van \nGogh, who painted such shoes several times.' But to grasp the \n'equipmental being of equipment,' we must know 'how shoes \nactually serve.' For the peasant woman they serve without her \nthinking about them or even looking at them. Standing and walk\u00ad\ning in the shoes, the peasant woman knows the serviceability \n[Dienlichkeit] in which 'the equipmental being of equipment con\u00ad\nsists.'

They have effects on everything \nthat follows. He simplifies matters by saying that Heidegger \ninterprets a painting to illustrate the nature of art as the un\u00ad\nveiling of truth. To prove this, one has no need to refer to what \nthe following page says, i.e., (in translation first): lithe work in \nno way served (diente gar nicht), as it may have seemed at first, \nto illustrate more clearly what a product is.\" What has here been \ntranslated as lIillustrate\" is Veranschaulichung this time, and \nnot Darstellung, which was also translated above as illustration. \nVeranschaulichung, intuitive presentation, as it were, is what \nhad to be facilitated by invoking the example of the picture. \nBut it is also what was not done, although it seemed as though \nthat's what was happening. Heidegger makes this quite clear: \nthe work did not serve us to do that, did not do us this service \nwhich, all in all, we pretended to expect from it. It did better \nthan illustrating or presenting something to sensory intuition\u00ad\nor worse, depending on the point of view- it showed, it made \nappear. Heidegger has just recalled that the work did not \"serve\" \nas Veranschaulichung or Darstellung, and he goes on to specify: \n\"Much more is it the being-product of the product which arrives, \nproperly (eigens) and only through the work, at its appearing.\" \nThis appearing of the being-product does not, according to Hei\u00ad\ndegger, take place in an elsewhere which the work of art could \nillustrate by referring to it. It takes place properly (and only) in \nthe work. In its very truth. This might seem to aggravate the \nillusion denounced by Schapiro and to place under the heading \nof presentation what was marked down only in the name of \nrepresentation, as if Heidegger thought he could see still more \ndirectly what Schapiro reproaches him for inferring too hastily. \nBut things are not yet so simple and we shall have to return to \nthis. \nFirst of all: it is not as peasant shoes, but as product (Zeug) \nor as shoes-as-product that the being-product manifested itself. \nThe manifestation is that of the being-product of the product and \nnot of this or that species of product, such as shoes. Such was the \nfunction of the Darstellung. It must be carefully demarcated in \nthis passage and its stages differentiated. Heidegger is not simply, \nas Schapiro claims, in the process of distinguishing between three \nmodes of being of the thing. \n"

I pick out and em\u00ad\nphasize a few words: \"The product (Zeug), for example the shoe\u00ad\nproduct (Schuhzeug) rests, as ready (fertig, finished) in itself as \nthe thing pure and simple, but it does not have, as does the block \nof granite, this Eigenwiichsige [difficult to translate: not \"spon\u00ad\ntaneity,\" as the French translation has it, but compact self\u00ad\nsufficiency, dense propriety referring only to itself, stubborn]. On \nthe other hand the product also shows an affinity (Verwandtschaft) \nwith the work of art, inasmuch as it is produced (hervorgebracht) \nby the hand of man. In spite of this, the work of art in its turn, \nby its self-sufficient presence (in seinem selbstgeniigsamen An\u00ad\nwesen), resembles (gleicht) the thing pure and simple, referring \nonly to itself (eigenwichsige) and constrained to nothing (zu nichts \ngedriingten)] [ . . .  ]. Thus the product is half a thing, because de\u00ad\ntermined by thingliness, and yet more than that; at the same time \nit is half work of art, and yet less than that \n- so a work like the shoe picture represents half of itself and \nyet less than that \n- and yet less than that, because it lacks the self-sufficiency \nof the work of art. \n- so a work like the shoe-picture exhibits what something \nlacks in order to be a work, it exhibits-in shoes-its lack of itself, \none could almost say its own lack. And that is how it's supposed \nto be self-sufficient? Accomplished? Does it complete itself then? \nUnless it overflows (itself), into inadequation, excess, the \nsupplement? \n- Heidegger continues. \"The product thus has its proper in\u00ad\ntermediate place (Zwischenstellung) between the thing and the \nwork, always supposing that it is permissible to give in to such \nan accountant-like classification.\" \nWhat, to Heidegger's own eyes, limits the legitimacy of this \narithmetical triplicity (the one by which Schapiro boldly sums \nup the whole context: \"in the course of distinguishing three modes \nof things . . .  \"), is that if thing 2 (the product) is between thing I \n"
