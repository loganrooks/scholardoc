The \ndivision in question was held back because thinking failed in the adequate \nsayingh of this turning [Kehre] and did not succeed with the help of the \nlanguage of metaphysics. The lecture \"On the Essence of Truth,\" thought \nout and delivered in 1930 but not printed until 1943, provides a certain \ninsight into the thinking of the turning from \"Being and Time\" to \"Time \nand Being.\" This turning is not a change of standpoinf from Being tmd \nTime, but in it the thinking that was sought first arrives at the locality of \nthat dimension out of which Being and Time is experienced, that is to say, \nexperienced in 10 the fundamental experience of the oblivion of being. d \n.... By way of contrast, Sartre expresses the basic tenet of existentialism in \nthis way: Existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking existentia \nand essentia according to their metaphysical meaning, which from Plato's \ntime on has said that essentia precedes existentia. Sartre reverses this state\u00ad\nment. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical \nstatemeni] With it he stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of \nbeing. For even if philosophy wishes to detennine the relation of esen\u00ad\ntin and existentia in the sense it had in medieval controversies, in Leibniz's \nsense, or in some other way, it still [16o) remains to ask first of all from \nwhat destiny of being this differentiationc in being as ese essentiae and ese \nexistentiae comes to appear to thinking. We have yet to consider why the \nquestion about the destiny of being was never asked and why it could never \nbe thought. Or is the fact that this is how it is with the differentiation of \nessentia and existentia not a sign of forgetfulness of being? We must presume \nthat this destiny does not rest upon a mere failure of human thinking, let \nalone upon a lesser capacity of early Western thinking. Concealed in its es\u00ad\nsential provenance, the differentiation of essentia (essentiality) and existentia \n(actuality) completely dominates the destiny of Western history and of all \nhistory determined by Europe. \nSartre's key proposition about the priority of existentia over essentia does, \nhowever, justify using the name \"existentialism\" as an appropriate title for a \nphilosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of \"existentialism\" has nothing \nat all in common with the statement from Being and Time - apart from the \n;I First edition, 1 949: In tenns of the \"what\" and \"how\" of that which is thought-worthy and \nof thinking. \nh First edition, 1 949: Letting itself show. \n,.

Whatever stems from it cannot be \ncountered or even cast aside by refutations. It can only be taken up in such \na way that its truth is more primordially sheltered in being itself [167] and \nremoved from the domain of mere human opinion. All refutation in the \nfield of essential thinking is foolish. Strife among thinkers is the \"lovers' \nquarrel\" concerning the matter itself. It assists them mutually toward a sim\u00ad\nple belonging to the Same, from which they find what is fitting for them in \nthe destiny of being. \nAssuming that in the future the human being will be able to think the \ntruth of being, he will think from ek-sistence. The human being stands \nek-sistingly in the destiny of being. The ek-sistence of the human being \nis historical as such, but not only or primarily because so much happens \nto the human being and to things human in the course of time. Because \nit must think the ek-sistence of Da-sein, the thinking of Being and Time is \nessentially concerned that the historicity of Dasein be experienced. \nBut does not Being and Time say on p. 2 1 2, where the \"there is I it gives\" \ncomes to language, \"Only so long as Dasein is, is there (gibt es] being\"? To \nbe sure. It means that only so long as the clearing of being propriates does \nbeing convey itself to human beings. But the fact that the Da, the clearing \nas the truth of being itself, propriates is the dispensation of being itself. \nThis is the destiny of the clearing. But the sentence does not mean that the \nDasein of the human being in the traditional sense of existentia, and thought \nin modem philosophy as the actuality of the ego cogito, is that entity through \nwhich being is first fashioned. The sentence does not say that being is the \nproduct of the human being. The Introduction to Being and Time (p. 38) \nsays simply and clearly, even in italics, \"Being is the transcendens pure and \nsimple.\" just as the openness of spatial nearness seen from the perspective \nof a particular thing exceeds all things near and far, so is being essentially \nbroader than all beings, because it is the clearing itself. For all that, being \nis thought on the basis of beings, a consequence of the approach - at first \nunavoidable - within a metaphysics that is still dominant. Only from such \na perspective does being show itself in and as a transcending. \n[168] The introductory definition, \"Being is the transcendens pure and \nsimple,\" articulates in one simple sentence the way the essence of being \nhitherto has been cleared for the human being.

That is why we also say (p. 2 30) that how being is, is to be understood \nchiefly from its \"meaning\" [Sinn], that is, from the truth of being. Being \nis cleared for the human being in ecstatic projection [Entwu1). But this \nprojection does not create being. \nMoreover, the projection is essentially a thrown projection. \\Vhatthrows \nin such projection is not the human being but being itself, which sends the \nhuman being into the ek-sistence of Da-sein that is his essence. This des\u00ad\ntiny propriates as the clearing of being -which it is. The clearing grants \nnearness to being. In this nearness, in the clearing of the Da, the human \nbeing dwells as the ek-sisting one without yet being able properly to ex\u00ad\nperience and take over this dwelling today. In the lecture on Holderlin's \nelegy \"Homecoming\" (1943) this nearness \"of\" being, which the Da of \nDasein is, is thought on the basis of Being and Time; it is perceived as spo\u00ad\nken from the minstrel's poem; from the experience of the oblivion of being \nit is called the \"homeland.\" The word is thought here in an essential sense, \nnot patriotically or nationalistically, but in terms of the history of being. \nThe essence of the homeland, however, is also mentioned with the inten\u00ad\ntion of thinking the homelessness of contemporary human beings from the \nessence of being's history. Nietzsche was the last to experience this home\u00ad\nlessness. [169) From within metaphysics he was unable to find any other \nway out than a reversal of metaphysics. But that is the height of futility. \nOn the other hand, when Holderlin composes \"Homecoming\" he is con\u00ad\ncerned that his \"countrymen\" find their essence. He does not at all seek \nthat essence in an egoism of his people. He sees it rather in the context of a \nbelongingness to the destiny of the West. But even the West is not thought \nregionally as the Occident in contrast to the Orient, nor merely as Europe, \nhut rather world-historically out of nearness to the source. We have still \nscarcely begun to think the mysterious relations to the East that have come \nto Ymrd in Holderlin's poetry (cf. \"The lster\"; also \"The Journey,\" third \nstrophe ff.). \"German\" is not spoken to the world so that the world might \nbe reformed through the German essence; rather, it is spoken to the Ger\u00ad\nmans so that from a destinal belongingness to other peoples they might be\u00ad\ncome world-historical along with them (see remarks on Holderlin's poem \n257 \n"

Homelessness is the symptom of oblivion of being. Because of it the \ntruth of being remains unthought. The oblivion of being makes itselflmown \nindirectly through the fact that the ( 170] human being always observes \nand handles only beings.

That is what is essentially - that is, from being itself- at \nissue here, insofar as being appropriates the human being as ek-sisting for \nguardianship over the truth of being into this truth itself. \"Humanism\" now \nmeans, in case we decide to retain the word, that the essence of the human \nbeing is essential for the truth of being, specifically in such a way that what \nmatters is not the human being simply as such. So we are thinking a curious \nkind of\"humanism.\" The word results in a name that is a Iucus a non /ucendo \n[literally, a grove where no light penetrates]. \nShould we still keep the name \"humanism\" for a \"humanism\" that contra\u00ad\ndicts all previous humanism - although it in no way advocates the inhuman? \nAnd keep it just so that by sharing in the use of the name we might perhaps \nswim in the predominant currents, stifled in metaphysical subjectivism and \nsubmerged in oblivion of being?

Should \nwe not rather suffer a little while longer those inevitable misinterpretations \nto which the path of thinking in the element of being and time has hitherto \nbeen exposed and let them slowly dissipate? These misinterpretations are \nnatural reinterpretations of what was read, or simply mirrorings of what \none believes he knows already before he reads.

He stands out into the openness of being. \nBeing itself, which as the throw has projected the essence of the hwnan \nbeing into \"care,\" is as this openness. Thrown in such fashion, the hu\u00ad\nman being stands \"in\" the openness of being. \"World\" is the clearing of \nbeing into which the human being stands out on the basis of his thrown \nessence. \"Being-in-the-world\" designates the essence of ek-sistence with \nregard to the cleared dimension out of which the \"ek-\" of ek-sistence es\u00ad\nsentially unfolds.

However, this \nthinking is not ethics in the first instance because it is ontology. For on\u00ad\ntology always thinks solely the being (ov) in its being. But as long as the \nrruth of being is not thought aU ontology remains without its foundation. \nTherefore the thinking that in Being and Time tries to advance thought in a \npreliminary way into the truth of being characterizes itself as \"fundamental \nontology.\" It strives to reach back into the essential ground from which \nthought concerning the truth of being emerges. By initiating another in\u00ad\nquiry this thinking is already removed from the \"ontology\" of metaphysics \n(even that of Kant). \"Ontology\" itself, however, whether transcendental or \nprecritical, is subject to critique, not because it thinks the being of beings \nand in so doing reduces being to a concept, but because it does not think the \ntruth of being and so fails to recognize that there is a thinking more rigor\u00ad\nous than conceptual thinking. In the poverty of its first breakthrough, the \nthinking that tries to advance thought into the truth of being brings only a \nsmall pan of that wholly other dimension to language. This language even \nfalsifies itself, for it does not yet succeed in retaining the essential help of \nphenomenological seeing while dispensing with the inappropriate concern \nwith \"science\" and \"research.\" But in order to make the attempt at thinking \nrecognizable and at the same time understandable for existing philosophy, \nit could at first be expressed only within the horizon of [I 88] that existing \nphilosophy and the use of its current terms. \nIn the meantime I have learned to see that these very terms were bound \nto lead immediately and inevitably into error. For the terms and the con\u00ad\nceptual language corresponding to them were not rethought by readers \nfrom the matter particularly to be thought; rather, the matter was con\u00ad\nceived according to the established terminology in its customary meaning. \nThe thinking that inquires into the truth of being and so defines the hu\u00ad\nman being's essential abode from being and toward being is neither ethics \nnor ontology. Thus the question about the relation of each to the other no \nlonger has any basis in this sphere. Nonetheless, your question, thought in \na more original way, retains a meaning and an essential importance. \nFor it must be asked: If the thinking that ponders the truth of being \ndefines the essence of lmma11itas as ek-sistence from the latter's belonging\u00ad\nness to being, then does thinking remain only a theoretical representation \n"

Because ruhtlanon occurs essennally \nin being itself we can never discern it as something in beings. Reference \nto this impossibility never in any way proves that the origin of the not is \nno-saying. This proof appears to carry weight only if one posits beings as \nwhat is objective for subjectivity. From this alternative it follows that every \n\"not,\" because it never appears as something objective, must inevitably be \nthe product of a subjective act. But whether no-saying first posits the \"not\" \nas something merely thought, or whether nihilation first requires the \"no\" \nas what is to be said in the letting-be of beings - this can never be decided at \nall by a subjective reflection of a thinking already posited as subjectivity. In \nsuch a reflection we have not yet reached the dimension where the question \ncan be appropriately formulated.

Being nihilates - as being. Therefore the \"not\" \nappears in the absolute Idealism of Hegel and Schelling as the negativ\u00ad\nity of negation in the essence of being. But there being is thought in the \nsense of absolute actuality as the unconditioned will that wills itself and \ndoes so as the will of knowledge and of love. In this willing being as will \nto power is still concealed.

Being has already \nbeen destined to thinking. Being is as the destiny of thinking. But destiny \nis in itself historical. Its history has already come to language in the saying \nof thinkers. \nTo bring to language ever and again this advent of being that remains, \nand in its remaining waits for human beings, is the sole matter of thinking. \nFor this reason essential thinkers always say the Same.

The term \"Dasein\" neither takes \nthe place of the term \"consciousness,\" nor does the \"matter\" designated as \n\"Dasein\" take the place of what we represent to ourselves when we speak \nof \"consciousness.\" Rather, \"Dasein\" names that which is first of all to be \nexperienced, and subsequently thought accordingly, as a placeb - namely, \nas the locality of the truth of Being. \nWhat the term \"Dasein\" means throughout the treatise Being and Time \nis indicated already by the guiding thesis: \"The 'essence' of Dasein lies in its \nexistence\" (Being and Time, p. 42). \nTo be sure, in the language of metaphysics the word \"existence\" is a \nsynonym of \"Dasein\": both refer to the actuality of anything at all that \nis actual, from God to a grain of sand. As long, therefore, as the quoted \nsentence is understood only superficially, [203] the difficulty of what is \nto be thought is merely transferred from the word \"Dasein\" to the word \n\"existence.\" In Being and T111e, the term \"existence\" is used exclusively for \nthe Being of the human being. Once \"existence\" is understood correctly, \nthe \"essence\" of Dasein can be thought, in whose openness Being itself \nannounces and conceals itself, grants itself and withdraws; at the same \ntime, this truth of Being does not exhaust itself in Dasein, nor can it by \nanr means simply be identified with it after the fashion of the metaphysical \nproposition that all objectivity is as such also subjectivity. \n\\\\bat does \"existence\" mean in Being and Time?

Beings \nas a whole, however, show themselves to you in the light and shadow of the \nmetaphysics of the will to power, which Nietzsche interprets in the form of \na doctrine of values. \nIn the winter of 1939-40 I discussed The Worker among a small circle \nof university teachers. People were astonished that such a dear-sighted \nbook had been available for years, and that they themselves had not yet \nlearned even to venture the attempt to let their view of the present move \nwithin the optics of The Worker and to think in planetary terms. One could \nsense that even a universal, historiographical consideration of world history \nwas inadequate for such a task. At that time, people read enthusiastically \nThe Marble Cli.fi [Die Ma771W1\"klippen], but, as it seemed to me, without \na sufficiently broad, i.e., planetary, horizon. And we were not surprised, \neither, that an attempt to elucidate The Worker was kept under surveillance \nand eventually prohibited. For it belongs to the essence of the will to power \nnot to let the actual that it gains power over appear in that actuality which \nprevails as the will to power itself. \nYou will permit me to reproduce a note that I made during this attempt \nto elucidate your book. I do so in the hope that I can say some things more \nclearly and freely in the present letter. The note reads: \nErnst Junger's text The Worker is important because, in a different way from \nSpengler, it achieves what all Nietzsche literature thus far has been unable to achieve, \nnamely, to impart an experience of beings and the way in which they are, in the light \nof Nietzsche's projection of beings as will to power. Nietzsche's metaphysics, how\u00ad\never, is by no means comprehended thoughtfully; not even the ways to do so are \nindicated; on the contrary: instead of being worthy of question in a genuine sense, \nthis metaphysics becomes self-evident and seemingly superfluous. \n[2 19] As you can see, the critical question thinks in a direction that \nadmittedly does not belong to the sphere of tasks to be pursued by the \ndescriptions undertaken in The Worker. Much of what your descriptions \nbrought into view and brought to language for the first time is now seen and \nstated by everyone. Moreover, \"The Question concerning Technology\" \nowes a lasting debt to the descriptions in The Worker. It is appropriate to \nnote that your \"descriptions\" do not merely depict something actual that is \nal ready familiar, but make accessible a \"new actuality,\" in which it is \"not so \nrnuch a rnatter of new thoughts or a new system . . .  \" (Preface to The Worker). \nEven today the fruitful aspect of what you say is gathered within \"de\u00ad\nscription\" properly understood - and how should it not be? Yet the optics \n295 \n"
