But \nthis in turn resides in the plenitude of an essential being of the \nproduct. We call it Verliisslichkeit. \" This nomination, this giving \nof the name is also a complex \"act\": it presupposes, in its very \nperformance, a reliability of language and discoursej but it pro\u00ad\nduces it at the same time, it commits itself to it. We cannot \nanalyze this structure here but it would be necessary to do so. It \nis a \"work\" and a \"product\" at the same time, the only space in \nwhich discourse on the picture and the discourse of the picture \ncan let themselves be understood. The least one could say is that \nSchapiro did not go there [ne s 'y est pas rendu], to that space. \nAlong with the shoes he claimed authority over a domain (dis\u00ad\ncourse on painting, a specialism) whose frontiers he thought were \ndeterminable: beyond these frontiers lies, for example, the \"phil\u00ad\nosophical\" con text \n- But precisely not. \n- of The Origin, a more or less chatty philosophical context. \nThe competences are divided up. On this side, on the side of \npainting (\"we all know what that is\"), are the shoes of Van Gogh. \nSecond: in the logic of this procedure, \"reliability\" is the first \nor ultimate condition of concrete possibility of any reattachment: \nof the product to its usefulness, to its use, to its subject whether \nwearer or borne, to its belonging in genera1. These reattachments \nare attached to Verliisslichkeit, to this preoriginary gift [don] or \nabandon-\n- to THE-MOTHER then, or from THE-MOTHER, and the two\u00ad\nshoes are-\n- how can you go past what is said with these words without \nthinking first, in its approach, VerliisslichkeiU Then don't be in \na hurry to recognize schemas that are too useful.

To the possibility of a lure constituted by \nthe mirror play of the world, its Spiegelspiel. \nFourth: the possibility of tightening in general is illuminated \nhere by a translation difficulty which cannot be treated as inci\u00ad\ndental. I have not yet translated Verldsslichkeit. Reliability is a \nmore or less strict, more or less loose approximation. The French \ntranslator of Holzwege proposes a word which is both unaccept\u00ad\nable and yet pertinent in a subterranean way. Unacceptable at first \nsight: solidity. Verldsslichkeit as the solidity of the product, here \nof the shoes, because one can \"have confidence in them,\" says a \ntranslator's footnote; the shoe \"will not slip off,\" \"one can put \none's weight\" on it. \n- This seems in conformity with the idea of making a binding \ncontract with the shoes, a contract that binds and is bound with \ntheir very laces, passed off as a kind of deal [marche], to the letter \n[au pied de la lettre] or avant la lettre. \n- But in common usage, the solidity of a product comes above \nall from its qualities of physical resistance, the resistance of the \nmaterials from which it is made, the resistance of its forms to \nwearing out, etc. The idea of confidence, of credit, of faith, or of \nreliability seems rather to be absent from this. On the other hand, \nwhen the French translator (but without explaining himself, and \nwhether deliberately or not) sets \"solid\" in play, in the following \nsentence, with \"soldered\" (another unacceptable translation, for \ngewiss), he restitutes strangely a movement that is legible in the \ntext as I interpret it here. The chain which links solid to solidarity \nand to solder is indeed that of tightening up, the one that is at \nwork here. Here is the French translation from Holzwege. On first \nreading and because of the word \"solidity,\" it runs the risk of \ndefinitively obscuring the German version. And yet: \"the latter \n[usefulness] in its turn resides in the plenitude of an essential \nbeing of the product. We call it solidity (die Verldsslichkeit). Thanks \nto it (Kraft ihrer), the peasant woman is entrusted (eingelassen) \nby this product to the silent call (schweigenden Zuruf: the call \nis silent but is heard and understood, it is not mute; likewise the \npainting speaks while keeping silent); thanks to the solidity of \nthe product, she is soldered to her world (ist sie ihrer Welt gewiss). \n"

This alleged obviousness cannot be produced by \nthe form of the shoes, by some internal reading of the picture, \neven supposing that you can get in a single step from an internal \ndescription to an inference of the type: therefore the painted shoes \nbelong in reality to X, they represent the real shoes belonging in \nreality to X.

It does not only consist in the large number of \npeasants and peasant women, of peasant shoes (untied or not, and \nwhether or not they are named, declared, or entitled accordingly) \nwhich Van Gogh painted, before and after 1886; in the large num\u00ad\nber of scenes and objects from peasant life which he stubbornly \nwanted to restitute in painting and in truth (\"that it should be a \ntrue painting of peasants. I know that is it. . .\n. By such paintings, \nthey learn something useful.\" From letters to his brother Theo, \n1883-8 5 ;  these letters are full of invective against the \"city \ndwellers\"). No. It consists in this: the \"ideology\" which Heidegger \nis accused of projecting, an \"ideology\" which to save time we \ncould call rural, of the soil, earthy, artisanal, this \"heavy pathos \nof the native and the countryman\"-is it so alien to Van Gogh? \nTo the Van Gogh who said, \"When I say that I am a painter of \npeasants, it is indeed truly so and you will get a better idea from \n"

Let \nus not abuse this argument, but let us recognize that Heidegger's \nhallucinatory projection, if there is one, is motivated by this iden\u00ad\ntificatory support. One must, of course, explain why Heidegger \nneeded to choose a particular type of object (a product said to be \nfluseful\" as a garment, and this particular garment), a particular \ntype of picture, this particular painter, in order to say what he \nintended to. He couldn't have said the same thing just as easily \nwith other objects, with other painters, with other shoes, those \nof Van Eyck, Miro, Magritte, or Adami. Of course you have to \nanalyze the choice, and the limits, of the exemplary model for \nsuch a discourse on The Origin of the Work of Art. And you have \nto ask analogous questions about Heidegger's poetic models. But \nstill what remains is that the risks of projection were more lim\u00ad\nited. The flprojection\" is at work in the choice of the model rather \nthan in the analysis of it, once the exemplary corpus is that of \nVan Gogh. A certain analogy between Heidegger and Van Gogh, \nwhatever its limits from other points of view, a certain com\u00ad\nmunity of flpathos\" paradoxically provided a support for identi\u00ad\nfication which reduced by so much the risks of flprojection,\" of \nhallucinatory delirium. The \"pathetic\" paragraph on the silent \ncall of the earth is consonant, in another correspondence, with \nthis or that letter of Van Gogh. \n- I should like to go further. No longer in order to shield \nHeidegger from Schapiro's verdict or to find flattenuating circum\u00ad\nstances\" for him. But to bring out, beyond Schapiro's three de\u00ad\nmands, a wave of supplementary identification. Supplementary \nsince identification, like attribution, has a supplementary or par\u00ad\nergonal structure. And supplementary because this demand for \nreattachment is by definition insatiable, unsatisfied, always mak\u00ad\ning a higher bid. It always starts out again, it puts more on each \ntime. After having, in a defensive and critical mode, contested \nthe right of agricultural property claimed by Heidegger, Schapiro \npasses over to the general Dffensive. The offensive is unleashed \n"

Let us imagine \na painting of a peasant woman's shoes by Van Gogh. Would it not \nhave made manifest just those qualities and that sphere of being \ndescribed by Heidegger with such pathos? Heidegger would have \nmissed an important aspect of the painting: the artist's presence \nin the work.\" From this moment, the reappropriation of the shoes \nby his own Van Gogh will have no more limits, for Schapiro. At \nthe end of the offensive, we will no longer be dealing with a \ndetachable personal object la personal item or a piece of the body), \nan object in short which would belong to Van Gogh without being \nconfused with him, even if it were a phantom member.

Notably when Hamsun \nwrites: \"They lmy shoes) affected me like the ghost of my other \nI-a living part of my own self.\" To conclude from this, as he \nseems to do and as Schapiro in any case hastens to decide, that \n\"my other I\" is myself, is I, and especially that its ghost is I, you \nreally have to have your fingers stuck in your ears. What is \"my \nghost\"? What does the phrase \"the ghost of my other I\" say? My \nother I, is that myself or an other I, an other who says \"I\"? Or a \n\"myself\" which is itself only divided by the phantom of its dou\u00ad\nble? Once there is phantom or double as revenant, the logic of \nidentification-is there any need to insist on this?-is not so \neasily appeased as Schapiro seems to think. If I say: these shoes \nare the ghost of Van Gogh, of the other ghostly I of Van Gogh, the \noscillation of the genitive translates all by itself the malaise, the \nUnheimlichkeit of the thing: the ghost of Van Gogh as the one \nwho he is or as the one whom he has in him or in front of him \nand who is haunting him-an other, therefore: the phantom lwho \nis an other) in himself as the ghost of an other, etc . . . .  \n- But then what about the haunting of these shoes? Are they \na ghost la piece of ghost, a phantom member)? In that case are \nthey the ghost of Van Gogh or the ghost of the other I of Van \nGogh, and what does the other I mean then? Or else, without \nbeing a ghost themselves, do they have the ghost, are they the \npropi tious place for having, bringing back, taking, or keeping the \nghost, and which one? His own or the ghost of the I detachable) \nother? Of the unconscious of the other? \n- We will not answer that question here but we must see \nhow it is linked to that of the pair which for a while now you \nhaven't wanted to listen to. A spectral analysis of the two of the \nshoes should tell us how they go: whether they go together and \nin that case how, and whether they go on to the feet and in that \ncase how. To go with in the first case, to go on to in the second, \nbut to go on to doesn't mean to render themselves to lsuch-and\u00ad\nsuch a place).

What is then \nthe spectrum of possibilities of the possibility of specters?23 The \nshoes can be unpaired, each of them can belong to another pair \nby which they continue to let themselves be haunted. But in this \nfirst case of unmatchedness, things can still function [aller] or at \nleast walk [marcher] if the shoe size and the double orientation \n(right and left) permit. That is a first possibility, almost \"normal,\" \nalthough the unpairedness, indicated by other traits, makes limp \nor squint the disturbed experience that we have in this case. The \nsecond possibility: one single shoe. We've already spoken about \nit. Is it a pair that's had part of it amputated? Is it one shoe \namputated from the pair to which it belongs? Is it haunted by the \nother one? Triumphant and sovereign, alone at last, and capturing \nfor itself the whole of the fetishist investiture? Or the narcissistic \ninvestiture? Is it the better-collected double of the dead man or \nthe dead woman? The erection of the limp? The elimination of \nthe double? The misery or monumental sovereignty of the un\u00ad\nusable? All these investitures are possible, they remain, open to \nthe syntax of all the specters. The third possibility (I'm sure I'm \ngoing to forget some): two right shoes or two left shoes. They \ncannot be put on, or used, in principle. In any case they do not \ngo together without injuring the wearer, unless he has the feet of \na monster. But the two shoes, now detached from wearing and \nuse, reflect each other better. Each one is strangely the double of \nthe other. The accumulation of haunting here finds a supplemen\u00ad\ntary benefit, for it can combine the preceding possibilities, prop \nthem up, augment them. This third possibility divides in two: ( I )  \nthe two right shoes or two left shoes can belong to two different \npairs, and thus to an origin that continues to inhabit them even \nif they are detached from it. Each one of these pairs is separated \nfrom itself but leaves its mark on each shoe. It is recognizable, \nand this difference between the two right shoes or the two left \nshoes manages to break up, a little, their air of being superim\u00ad\nposable and therefore disturbing, limping, and suspicious; it ini\u00ad\ntiates a repairing which is very quickly inhibited. (2) The two \nright or left shoes are exactly alike, for they belong to two pairs \n(separated one from the other and from themselves) which have \nno difference between them except a numerical one. You would \nthink you were seeing double: two perfectly identical unique \n23 . Le spectre means both \"spectrum\" and \"specter.\" \n"
