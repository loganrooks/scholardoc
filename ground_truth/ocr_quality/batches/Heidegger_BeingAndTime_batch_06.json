Only because the Being of the \"there\" \nreceives its Constitution through understanding and through the char\u00ad\nacter of understanding as projection, only because it is what it becomes (or \nalternatively, does not become), can it say to itself'Become what you are', \nand say this with understanding. \n146 \nProjection always pertains to the full disclosedness of Being-in-the-\nworld ; as potentiality-for-Being, understanding has itself possibilities, \nwhich are sketched out beforehand within the range of what is essentially \ndisclosable in it. Understanding can devote itself primarily to the dis\u00ad\nclosedness of the world; that is, Dasein can, proximally and for the most \npart, understand itself in terms of its world. Or else understanding throws \nitself primarily into the \"for-the-sake-of-which\" ; that is, Dasein exists as \nitself. Understanding is either authentic, arising out of one's own Self as \nsuch, or inauthentic. The 'in-' of \"inauthentic\" does not mean that \nDasein cuts itself off from its Self and understands 'only' the world. The \nworld belongs to Being-one's-Self as Being-in-the-world. On the other \nhand, authentic understanding, no less than that which is inauthentic, \ncan be either genuine or not genuine. As potentiality-for-Being, under\u00ad\nstanding is altogether permeated with possibility. When one is diverted \ninto [Sichverlegen in] one of these basic possibilities of understanding, the \nother is not laid aside [legt . . .  nicht ab]. Because understanding, in every case, \npertains rather to Dasein' s full disclosedness as Being-in-the-world, this diversion \nof the understanding is an existential modification of projection as a whole. In under\u00ad\nstanding the world, Being-in is always understood along with it, while \nunderstanding of existence as such is always an understanding of the world. \nAs factical Dasein, any Dasein has already diverted its potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing into a possibility of understanding. \nIn its projective character, understanding goes to make up existentially \nwhat we call Dasein's \"sight\" [Sicht] . With the disclosedness of the \"there\", \nthis sight is existentially [existenzial seiende] ; and Dasein is this sight \nequiprimordially in each of those basic ways of its Being which we have \nalready noted : as the circumspection [Umsicht] of concern, as the con\u00ad\nsiderateness [Rucksicht] of solicitude, and as that sight which is directed \nupon Being as such [Sicht auf das Sein als solches], for the sake of which \nany Dasein is as it is. The sight which is related primarily and on the whole \nto existence we call \"transparency\" [Durchsichtigkeit]. We choose this term \nto designate 'knowledge of the Self'1 in a sense which is well understood, \n1 '  \"Selbsterkenntnis\" '. This should be carefully distinguished from the 'Sichkennen' \ndiscussed on H. 124\u00b71 25. Perhaps this distinction can be expresed-though rather crudely \n-by pointing out that we are here concerned with a full and sophisticated knowledge of \nthe Self in all its implications, while in the earlier passage we were concerned with the \nkind of 'self-knowledge' which one loses when one 'forgets oneself' or does something so \nout of character that one 'no longer knows oneself'. \n"

In existing, \nentities sight 'themselves' [sichtet \"sich\"] only in so far as they have \nbecome transparent to themselves with equal primordiality in those items \nwhich are constitutive for their existence : their Being-alongside the \nworld and their Being-with Others. \nOn the other hand, Dasein's opaqueness [Undurchsichtigkeit] is not \nrooted primarily and solely in 'egocentric' self-deceptions ; it is rooted just \nas much in lack of acquaintance with the world. \nWe must, to be sure, guard against a misunderstanding of the expression \n147 \n'sight'. It corresponds to the \"clearedness\" [Gelichtetheit] which we took \nas characterizing the disclosedness of the \"there\".

Of course, every 'sense' \ndoes this within that domain of discovery which is genuinely its own. But \nfrom the beginning onwards the tradition of philosophy has been oriented \nprimarily towards 'seeing' as a way of access to entities and to Being. To \nkeep the connection with this tradition, we may formalize \"sight\" and \n\"seeing\" enough to obtain therewith a universal term for characterizing \nany access to entities or to Being, as access in general. \nBy showing how all sight is grounded primarily in understanding (the \ncircumspection of concern is understanding as common sense [ Verstiindig\u00ad\nkeit]), we have deprived pure intuition [Anschauen] of its priority, which \ncorresponds noetically to the priority of the present-at-hand in traditional \nontology. 'Intuition' and 'thinking' are both derivatives of understanding, \nand already rather remote ones. Even the phenomenological 'intuition of \nessences' [\"Wesensschau\"] is grounded in existential understanding. We \ncan decide about this kind of seeing only if we have obtained explicit \nconceptions ofBeing and of the structure of Being, such as only phenomena \nin the phenomenological sense can become. \nThe disclosedness of the \"there\" in understanding is itself a way of \nDasein's potentiality-for-Being. In the way in which its Being is projected \nboth upon the \"for-the-sake-of-which\" and upon significance (the world), \nthere lies the disclosedness of Being in general.

The ready-to-hand \ncomes explicitly into the sight which understands. Al preparing, putting to \nrights, repairing, improving, rounding-out, are accomplished in the \nfollowing way : we take apart2 in its \"in-order-to\" that which is circum-\n149 \nspectively ready-to-hand, and we concern ourselves with it in accordance \nwith what becomes visible through this process. That which has been \ncircumspectively taken apart with regard to its \"in-order-to\", and taken \napart as such-that which is explicitly understood-has the structure of \nsomething as something. The circumspective question as to what this particu-\nlar thing that is ready-to-hand may be, receives the circumspectively \ninterpretative answer that it is for such and such a purpose [ es ist zum . . .  ] . \nIf we tell what it is for [des Wozu], we are not simply designating some\u00ad\nthing; but that which is designated is understood as that as which we are \nto take the thing in question. That which is disclosed in understanding-\nthat which is understood-is already accessible in such a way that its 'as \nwhich' can be made to stand out explicitly. The 'as' makes up the struc-\nture of the explicitness of something that is understood. It constitutes the \ninterpretation. In dealing with what is environmentally ready-to-hand \nby interpreting it circumspectively, we 'see' it as a table, a door, a car-\nriage, or a bridge ; but what we have thus interpreted [Ausgelegte] need \nnot necessarily be also taken apart [auseinander zu legen] by making an \nassertion which definitely characterizes it. Any mere pre-predicative seeing \nof the ready-to-hand is, in itself, something which already understands \nand interprets. But does not the absence of such an 'as' make up the \nmereness of any pure perception of something? Whenever we see with this \nkind of sight, we already do so understandingly and interpretatively. In \nthe mere encountering of something, it is understood in terms of a totality \nof involvements ; and such seeing hides in itself the explicitness of the \nassignment-relations (of the \"in-order-to\") which belong to that totality. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n gibt sich \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n zu verstehen, welche Bewandtnis es je mit dem Begegnenden haben \nkann.' \n2 'auseinandergelegt'.

In such an assertion the 'as' does not \nturn up for the first time ; it just gets expressed for the first time, and this \nis possible only in that it lies before us as something expressible.1 The fact \nthat when we look at something, the explicitness of assertion can be absent, \ndoes not justify our denying that there is any Articulative interpretation \nin such mere seeing, and hence that there is any as-structure in it. When \nwe have to do with anything, the mere seeing of the Things which are \nclosest to us bears in itself the structure of interpretation, and in so primor\u00ad\ndial a manner that just to grasp something free, as it were, of the \"as\", \nrequires a certain readjustment. When we merely stare at something, our \njust-having-it-before-us lies before us as a failure to understand it any more. \nThis grasping which is free of the \"as\", is a privation ofthe kind of seeing \nin which one merelJ understands. It is not more primordial than that kind \nof seeing, but is derived from it. If the 'as' is ontically unexpressed, this \nmust not seduce us into overlooking it as a constitutive state for under\u00ad\nstanding, existential and a priori. \nBut if we never perceive equipment that is ready-to-hand without \nalready understanding and interpreting it, and if such perception lets us \nI 50 \ncircumspectively encounter something as something, does this not mean \nthat in the first instance we have experienced something purely present\u00ad\nat-hand, and then taken it as a door, as a house ? This would be a \nmisunderstanding of the specific way in which interpretation functions as \ndisclosure. In interpreting, we do not, so to speak, throw a 'signification' \nover some naked thing which is present-at-hand, we do not stick a value \non it; but when something within-the-world is encountered as such, the \n1 ' \u2022\n.\n.\n was allein so moglich ist, dass es als Aussprechbares vor-Iiegt.' Here we follow the \nreading of the earlier editions. The hyphen in 'vor-liegt' comes at the end of the line in the \nlater editions, but is undoubtedly meant to suggest (like the italicization of the 'vor' in \nthe previous sentence) that this verb is to be interpreted with unusual literalness. \nThis paragraph is noteworthy for an exploitation of the prefix 'aus' ('out'), which fails \nto \u01a4how up in our translation. Literally an 'Aussage' ('assertion') is something which is \n'srud out' ; an 'Auslegung' ('interpretation'} is a 'laying-out' ; that which is 'ausdriicklich' \n('explicit') is something that has been 'pressed out' ; that which is 'aussprechbar' (our \n'expressible') is something that can be 'spoken out'. \nThe verbs 'ausdriicken' and 'aussprechen' are roughly synonymous; but 'aussprechen' \noften has the more specific connotations of 'pronunciation', 'pronouncing oneself', 'speak\u00ad\ning one's mind', 'finishing what one has to say', etc. While it would be possible to reserve \n'express' for 'ausdricken' and translate 'aussprechen' by some such phrase as 'speak out', \nit is more convenient to use 'express' for both verbs, especially since 'aussprechen' and its \nderivatives have occurred very seldom before the present chapter, in which 'ausdriicken' \nrarely appears. On the other hand, we can easily distinguish between the more frequent \n'ausdriicklich' and 'ausgesprochen' by translating the latter as 'expressed' or 'expressly', \nand reserving 'explicit' for both 'ausdriicklich' and 'explizit'. \n"

In an interpretative approach there lies such an assumption, \nas that which has been 'taken for granted' [\"gesetzt\"] with the interpre\u00ad\ntation as such-that is to say, as that which has been presented in our \nfore-having, our fore-sight, and our fore-conception. \nHow are we to conceive the character of this 'fore' ? Have we done so if \nwe say foqnally that this is something 'a priori' ? Why does understanding, \nwhich we have designated as a fundamental existentiale of Dasein, have \nI 5 I \nthis structure as its own ? Anything interpreted, as something interpreted, \nhas the 'as'-structure as its own; and how is this related to the 'fore' \nstructure ? The phenomenon of the 'as' -structure is manifestly not to be \ndissolved or broken up 'into pieces'. But is a primordial analytic for it \nthus ruled out? Are we to concede that such phenomena are 'ultimates' ? \nThen there would still remain the question, \"why ?\" Or do the fore\u00ad\nstructure of understanding and the as-structure of interpretation show an \nexistential-ontological connection with the phenomenon of projection? \nAnd does this phenomenon point back to a primordial state of Dasein's \nBeing? \nBefore we answer these questions, for which the preparation up till now \nhas been far from sufficient, we must investigate whether what has become \nvisible as the fore-structure of understanding and the as-structure of \ninterpretation, does not itself already present us with a unitary phenome\u00ad\nnon-one of which copious use is made in philosophical problematics, \nthough what is used so universally falls short of the primordiality of \nontological explication. \nIn the projecting of the understanding, entities are disclosed in their \npossibility. The character of the possibility corresponds, on each occasion, \nwith the kind of Being of the entity which is understood. Entities within\u00ad\nthe-world generally are projected upon the world-that is, upon a whole \nof significance, to whose reference-relations concern, as Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, has been tied up in advance.

Meaning is an existentiale of Dasein, not a property \nattaching to entities, lying 'behind' them, or floating somewhere as an \n'intermediate domain'. Dasein only 'has' meaning, so far as the \ndisclosedness of Being-in-the-world can be 'filled in' by the entities dis\u00ad\n\u0207overable in that disclosedness. 2 Hence only Dasein can be meaningful [sinn\u00ad\nJOlt] or meaningless [sinnlos]. That is to say, its own Being and the entities \n:lisclosed with its Being can be appropriated in understanding, or can \n:emain relegated to non-understanding. \nThis Interpretation of the concept of 'meaning' is one which is onto-\n152 \ntogico-cxistential in principle; if we adhere to it, then all entities whose \nkind of Being is of a character other than Dasein's must be conceived as \nunmeaning [unsinniges], essentially devoid of any meaning at all. Here \n'unmeaning' does not signify that we are saying anything about the \nvalue of such entities, but it gives expression to an ontological \ncharacteristic. And only that which is unmeaning can be absurd [ widersinnig]. \nThe present-at-hand, as Dasein encounters it, can, as it were, assault \nDasein's Being; natural events, for instance, can break in upon us and \ndestroy us. \nAnd if we are inquiring about the meaning of Being, our investigation \ndoes not then become a \"deep\" one [tiefsinnig], nor does it puzzle out \nwhat stands behind Being. It asks about Being itself in so far as Being \nenters into the intelligibility ofDasein.

The point of this puzzling and ambiguous \nsentence may become somewhat clearer if the reader recalls that here as elsewhere (see \nH. 75 above) the verb 'erschliessen' ('disclose') is used in the sense of 'opening something \n!JP' so that its contents can be 'discovered'. What thus gets 'opened up' will then be 'filled \nIn' as more and more of its contents get discovered. \nG \n"

Mathematics is not more rigorous than his\u00ad\ntoriology, but only narrower, because the existential foundations relevant \nfor it lie within a narrower range. \nThe 'circle' in understanding belongs to the structure of meaning, and \nthe latter phenomenon is rooted in the existential constitution ofDasein\u00ad\nthat is, in the understanding which interprets. An entity for which, as \nBeing-in-the-world, its Being is itself an issue, has, ontologically, a \ncircular structure. If, however, we note that 'circularity' belongs onto\u00ad\nlogically to a kind of Being which is present-at-hand (namely, to subsist\u00ad\nence [Bestand]), we must altogether avoid using this phenomenon to \ncharacterize anything like Dasein ontologically. \n] 33\u00b7 Assertion as a Derivative Morfe of Interpretation \nAll interpretation is grounded on understanding. That which has been \narticulated 1 as such in interpretation and sketched out beforehand in the \nunderstanding in general as something articulable, is the meaning. In so \nfar as assertion (\u0150udgment') 2 is grounded on understanding and presents \n154 \nus with a derivative form in which an interpretation has been carried out, \nit too 'has' a meaning. Yet this meaning cannot be defined as something \nwhich occurs 'in' [\"an\"] a judgment along with the judging itself. In our \n1 'Gegliederte'.

It remains to ask with what justification we have \ntaken assertion as a mode of interpretation at all. If it is something of \nthis sort, then the essential structures of interpretation must recur in it. \nThe pointing-out which assertion does is performed on the basis of what \nhas already been disclosed in understanding or discovered circumspec\u00ad\ntively. Assertion is not a free-floating kind of behaviour which, in its own \nright, might be capable of disclosing entities in general in a primary way : \non the contrary it always maintains itself on the basis of Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld. What we have shown earlierlx in relation to knowing the world, \nholds just as well as assertion. Any assertion requires a fore-having of \nr 57 \nwhatever has been disclosed ; and this is what it points out by way of \ngiving something a definite character. Furthermore, in any approach \nwhen one gives something a definite character, one is already taking a \nlook directionally at what is to be put forward in the assertion. When an \nentity which has been presented is given a definite character, the function \nof giving it such a character is taken over by that with regard to which we \nset our sights towards the entity.1 Thus any assertion requires a fore-sight; \nin this the predicate which we are to assign [zuzuweisende] and make \nstand out, gets loosened, so to speak, from its unexpressed inclusion in the \nentity itself. To any assertion as a communication which gives something \na definite character there belongs, moreover, an Articulation of what is \npointed out, and this Articulation is in accordance with significations. \nSuch an assertion will operate with a definite way of conceiving : \"The \nhammer is heavy\", \"Heaviness belongs to the hammer\", \"The hammer \nhas the property of heaviness\". When an assertion is made, some fore\u00ad\nconception is always implied ; but it remains for the most part incon\u00ad\nspicuous, because the language already hides in itself a developed way \nof conceiving. Like any interpretation whatever, assertion necessarily has \na fore-having, a fore-sight, and a fore-conception as its existential founda-\ntions. \n1 'Woraufhin das vorgegebene Seiende anvisiert wird, das iibernimmt im Bestimmungs\u00ad\nvollzug die Funktion des Bestimmenden.' \n"

Prior to all \nanalysis, logic has already understood 'logically' what it takes as a theme \nunder the heading of the \"categorical statement\"-for instance, 'The \nhammer is heavy'. The unexplained presupposition is that the 'meaning' \nof this sentence is to be taken as: \"This Thing-a hammer-has the \nproperty of heaviness\". In concernful circumspection there are no such \nassertions 'at first'. But such circumspection has of course its specific ways \nof interpreting, and these, as .compared with the 'theoretical judgment' \njust mentioned, may take some such form as 'The hammer is too heavy', \nor rather just 'Too heavy !', 'Hand me the other hammer !' Interpretation \nis carried out primordially not in a theoretical statement but in an action \nof circumspective concern-laying aside the unsuitable tool, or exchanging \nit, 'without wasting words'. From the fact that words are absent, it may \nnot be concluded that interpretation is absent. On the other hand, \nthe kind of interpretation which is circumspectively expressed is not \nnecessarily already an assertion in the sense we have defined. By what \nexistential-ontological modifications does assertion arise from circumspective inter\u00ad\npretation? \nThe entity which is held in our fore-having-for instance, the hammer \n-is proximally ready-to-hand as equipment. If this entity becomes the \n'object' of an assertion, then as soon as we begin this assertion, there is \nalready a change-over in the fore-having. Something ready-to-hand with \nwhich we have to do or perform something, turns into something 'about \nwhich' the assertion that points it out is made. Our fore-sight is aimed at \nsomething present-at-hand in what is ready-to-hand. Both by andfor this \nway of looking at it [Hin-sicht], the ready-to-hand becomes veiled as \nready-to-hand. Within this discovering of presence-at-hand, which is at \nthe same time a covering-up of readiness-to-hand, something present-at\u00ad\nhand which we encounter is given a definite character in its Being-present\u00ad\nat-hand-in-such-and-such-a-manner. Only now are we given any access \nto properties or the like. When an assertion has given a definite character \nto something present-at-hand, it says something about it as a \"what\" ; \nand this \"what\" is drawnfrom that which is present-at-hand as such. The \nas-structure of interpretation has undergone a modification. In its func\u00ad\ntion of appropriating what is understood, the 'as' no longer reaches out \ninto a totality of involvements. As regards its possibilities for Articulating \nreference-relations, it has been cut off from that significance which, as \nsuch, constitutes environmentality. The 'as' gets pushed back into the \n"

The fact that language now becomes our \ntheme for the first time will indicate that this phenomenon has its roots in \nthe existential constitution of Dasein's disclosedness. The existential\u00ad\nontological foundation of language is discourse or talk.1 This phenomenon is \n161 \none of which we have been making constant use already in our foregoing \nInterpretation of state-of-mind, understanding, interpretation, and asser-\ntion; but we have, as it were, kept it suppressed in our thematic analysis. \nDiscourse is existentially equiprimordial with state-of-mind and understanding. \nThe intelligibility of something has always been articulated, even before \nthere is any appropriative interpretation of it. Discourse is the Articulation \n1 '&de'. As we have pointed out earlier (see our note 3, p. 47, H. 25 above) , we have \n\u0229anslated this word either as 'discourse' or 'talk', as the context seems to demand, some\u00ad\ntimes compromising with the hendiadys 'discourse or talk'. But in some contexts 'dis\u00ad\ncourse' is too formal while 'talk' is too colloquial ; the reader must remember that there is \nno good English equivalent for 'Rede'.

The items constitutive for discourse \nare : what the discourse is about (what is talked about) ; what is said-in\u00ad\nthe-talk, as such ; the communication; and the making-known. These are \nnot properties which can just be raked up empirically from language. \nThey are existential characteristics rooted in the state of Dasein's Being, \nr63 \nand it is they that first make anything like language ontologically possible. \nIn the factical linguistic form of any definite case of discourse, some of \nthese items may be lacking, or may remain unnoticed. The fact that they \noften do not receive 'verbal' expression, is merely an index of some definite \nkind of discourse which, in so far as it is discourse, must in every case lie \nwithin the totality of the structures we have mentioned. \nAttempts to grasp the 'essence of language' have always taken their \norientation from one or another of these items; and the clues to their \nconceptions of language have been the ideas of 'expression', of 'symbolic \nform', of communication as 'assertion', 1 of the 'making-knoWn' of experi\u00ad\nences, of the 'patterning' of life. Even if one were to put these various \nfragmentary definitions together in syncretistic fashion, nothing would be \nachieved in the way of a fully adequate definition of \"language\". We \nwould still have to do what is decisive here-to work out in advance the \nontologico-existential whole of the structure of discourse on the basis of the \nanalytic of Dasein. \nWe can make clear the connection of discourse with understanding and \nintelligibility by considering an existential possibility which belongs to \ntalking itself-hearing. If we have not heard 'aright', it is not by accident \nthat we say we have not 'understood'. Hearing is constitutive for discourse. \nAnd just as linguistic utterance is based on discourse, so is acoustic \nperception on hearing. Listening to . . .  is Dasein's existential way of \nBeing-open as Being-with for Others. Indeed, hearing constitutes the \nprimary and authentic way in which Dasein is open for its ownmost \npotentiality-for-Being-as in hearing the voice of the friend whom every \nDasein carries with it. Dasein hears, because it understands. As a Being\u00ad\nin-the-world with Others, a Being which understands, Dasein is 'in thrall' \nto Dasein-with and to itself; and in this thraldom it \"belongs\" to these. 2 \nBeing-with develops in listening to one another [Aufeinander-horen], \nwhich can be done in several possible ways : following, 3 going along with, \n1 ' .\n\u2022\n.\n der Mitteilung als \"Aussage\" .\n\u2022\n .'

In this sentence Heidegger uses some \ncognates of 'hi:iren' ('hearing') whose interrelations disappear in our version. \n3 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  des Folgens . .  .'

Speaking at length [Viel-sprechen] about \nsomething does not offer the slightest guarantee that thereby under\u00ad\nstanding is advanced. On the contrary, talking extensively about some\u00ad\nthing, covers it up and brings what is understood to a sham clarity-the \nunintelligibility of the trivial. But to keep silent does not mean to be \ndumb. On the contrary, if a man is dumb, he still has a tendency to \n165 \n'speak'. Such a person has not proved that he can keep silence; indeed, \nhe entirely lacks the possibility of proving anything of the sort. And the \nperson who is accustomed by Nature to speak little is no better able to \nshow that he is keeping silent or that he is the sort of person who can do \nso. He who never says anything cannot keep silent at any given moment. \nKeeping silent authentically is possible only in genuine discoursing. To be \nable to keep silent, Dasein must have something to say-that is, it must \nhave at its disposal an authentic and rich disclosedness of itself. In that \ncase one's reticence [Verschwiegenheit] makes something manifest, and \ndoes away with 'idle talk' [\"Gerede\"]. As a mode of discoursing, reticence \nArticulates the intelligibility ofDasein in so primordial a manner that it \ngives rise to a potentiality-for-hearing which is genuine, and to a Being\u00ad\nwith-one-another which is transparent. \nBecause discourse is constititutive for the Being of the \"there\" (that is, \nfor states-of-mind and understanding), while \"Dasein\" means Being-in\u00ad\nthe-world, Dasein as discursive Being-in, has already expressed itsel\u00a3 \nDasein has language.

Terminologically, it signifies a positive pheno\u00ad\nmenon which constitutes the kind of Being of everyday Dasein's under\u00ad\nstanding and interpreting. For the most part, discourse is expressed by \nbeing spoken out, and has always been so expressed ; it is language. 2 But \nin that case understanding and interpretation already lie in what has thus \nbeen expressed. In language, as a way things have been expressed or \nspoken out [Ausgesprochenheit], there is hidden a way in which the under\u00ad\nstanding of Dasein has been interpreted. This way of interpreting it is no \nmore just present-at-hand than language is ; on the contrary, its Being is \nitself of the character of Dasein.

But now we must go beyond a bare allusion \nto the Fact of this interpretedness of Dasein, and must inquire about the \nexistential kind of Being of that discourse which is expressed and which \nexpresses itself.

Idle talk is the possibility of understanding every\u00ad\nthing without previously making the thing one's own. If this were done, idle \ntalk would founder; and it already guards against such a danger. Idle talk \nis something which anyone can rake up ; it not only releases one from the \ntask of genuinely understanding, but develops an undifferentiated kind of \nintelligibility, for which nothing is closed off any longer. \nDiscourse, which belongs to the essential state of Dasein's Being and has a \nshare in constituting Dasein's disclosedness, has the possibility of becoming \nidle talk. And when it does so, it serves not so much to keep Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld open for us in an articulated understanding, as rather to close it \noff, and cover up the entities within-the-world. To do this, one need not \naim to deceive. Idle talk does not have the kind of Being which belongs to \nconsciously passing of something as something else. The fact that something \nhas been said groundlessly, and then gets passed along in further retelling, \namounts to perverting the act of disclosing [Erchliessen] into an act of \nclosing off [Verschliessen] . For what is said is always understood proxim\u00ad\nally as 'saying' something-that is, an uncovering something. Thus, by \nits very nature, idle talk is a closing-off, since to go back to the ground of \nwhat is talked about is something which it leaves undone. \nThis closing-off is aggravated afresh by the fact that an understanding \nof what is talked about is supposedly reached in idle talk. Because of this, \nidle talk discourages any new inquiry and any disputation, and in a \npeculiar way suppresses them and holds them back. \nThis way in which things have been interpreted in idle talk has already \nestablished itself in Dasein. There are many things with which we first \nbecome acquainted in this way, and there is not a little which never gets \nbeyond such an average understanding. This everyday way in which \nthings have been interpreted is one into which Dasein has grown in the \nfirst instance, with never a possibility of extrication. In it, out of it, and \nagainst it, all genuine understanding, interpreting, and communicating, \nall re-discovering and appropriating anew, are performed. In no case is a \nDasein, untouched and unseduced by this way in which things have been \ninterpreted, set before the open country of a 'world-in-itself, so that it just \nbeholds what it encounters. The dominance of the public way in which \nthings have been interpreted has already been decisive even for the \npossibilities of having a mood-that is, for the basic way in which Dasein \n1 70 \nlets the world \"matter\" to it.1 The \"they\" prescribes one's state-of-mind, \nand determines what and how one 'sees'. \n1 \u2022. \n\u2022 \n\u2022 tiber die Moglichkeiten des Gestimmtseins entschieden, das heisst tiber die \nGrundart, in der sich das Dasein von der Welt angehen liisst.'

Curiosity is everywhere and nowhere. This mode of \nBeing-in-the-world reveals a new kind of Being of everyday Dasein-a \nkind in \u018fhich Dasein is constantly uprooting itself. \nIdle talk controls even the ways in which one may be curious.

These two everyday modes of \nBeing for discourse and sight are not just present-at-hand side by side in \ntheir tendency to uproot, but either of these ways-to-be drags the other one \nwith it. Curiosity, for which nothing is closed off, and idle talk, for which \nthere is nothing that is not understood, provide themselves (that is, the \nDasein which is in this manner [dem so seienden Dasein]) with the guar\u00ad\nantee of a 'life' which, supposedly, is genuinely 'lively'.

Ambiguity not only affects the way we \navail ourselves of what is accessible for use and enjoyment, and the way \nwe manage it; ambiguity has already established itself in the under\u00ad\nstanding as a potentiality-for-Being, and in the way Dasein projects itself \nand presents itself with possibilities.1 Everyone is acquainted with what \nis up for discussion and what occurs,2 and everyone discusses it; but \neveryone also knows already how to talk about what has to happen first\u00ad\nabout what is not yet up for discussion but 'really' must be done.

Indeed \nthis interest persists, in a kind of curiosity and idle talk, only so long as \nthere is a possibility of a non-committal just-surmising-with-someone-else. \nBeing \"in on it\" with someone [ das Mit-dabei-sein] when one is on the \nscent, and so long as one is on it, precludes one's allegiance when what \nhas been surmised gets carried out. For in such a case Dasein is in every \ncase forced back on itself. Idle talk and curiosity lose their power, and are \nalready exacting their penalty. 2 When confronted with the carrying\u00ad\nthrough of what \"they\" have surmised together, idle talk readily estab\u00ad\nlishes that \"they\" \"could have done that too\"-for \"they\" have indeed \nsurmised it together. In the end, idle talk is even indignant that what it \nhas surmised and constantly demanded now actualry happens. In that case, \nindeed, the opportunity to keep on surmising has been snatched away. \u00b7 \nBut when Dasein goes in for something in the reticence of carrying it \nthrough or even of genuinely breaking down on it, its time is a different \ntime and, as seen by the public, an essentially slower time than that of \nidle talk, which 'lives at a faster rate'. Idle talk will thus long since have \ngone on to something else which is currently the very newest thing. That \nwhich was earlier surmise and has now been carried through, has come too \nlate if one looks at that which is newest. Idle talk and curiosity take care \nin their ambiguity to ensure that what is genuinely and newly created is \nout of date as soon as it emerges before the public. Such a new creation \ncan become free in its positive possibilities only if the idle talk which covers \nit up has become ineffective, and if the 'common' interest has died away. \nIn the ambiguity of the way things have been publicly interpreted, \ntalking about things ahead of the game and making surmises about them \ncuriously, gets passed off as what is really happening, while taking action \nand carrying something through get stamped as something merely sub\u00ad\nsequent and unimportant. Thus Dasein's understanding in the \"they\" is \nconstantly going wrong [versieht sich] in its projects, as regards the genuine \npossibilities of Being.

This kind of not-Being has to be conceived as \nthat kind of Being which is closest to Dasein and in which Dasein main\u00ad\ntains itself for the most part. \nSo neither must we take the fallenness of Dasein as a 'fall' from a purer \nand higher 'primal status'. Not only do we lack any experience of this \nontically, but ontologically we lack any possibilities or clues for Inter\u00ad\npreting it. \nIn falling, Dasein itself as factical Being-in-the-world, is something from \nwhich it has already fallen away. And it has not fallen into some entity \nwhich it comes upon for the first time in the course of its Being, or even \none which it has not come upon at all ; it has fallen into the world, which \nitself belongs to its Being. Falling is a definite existential characteristic \nof Dasein itself. It makes no assertion about Dasein as something present\u00ad\nat-hand, or about present-at-hand relations to entities from which Dasein \n'is descended' or with which Dasein has subsequently wound up in some \nsort of commercium. \nWe would also misunderstand the ontologico-existential structure of \nfalling3 if we were to ascribe to it the sense of a bad and deplorable \nontical property of which, perhaps, more advanced stages of human \nculture might be able to rid themselves. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n und an die \"Welt\" verfallen.' While we shall follow English idioms by translating \n'an die \"Welt\" ' as 'into the \"world\" ' in contexts such as this, the preposition 'into' is \nhardly the correct one. The idea is rather that of falling at the world or collapsing against it. \n2 'Un- und nichteigentlich, bedeutet aber keineswegs \"eigentlich nicht\" \u2022\n.\n .' \n3 'Die ontologisch-existenziale Struktur des Verfallens \u2022\n.\n .' The words 'des Verfallens' \ndo not appear in the earlier editions. \n"

The alienation of \nfalling-at once tempting and tranquillizing-leads by its own movement, \nto Dasein's getting entangled [verjangt] in itself. \nThe phenomena we have pointed out-temptation, tranquillizing, \nalienation and self-entangling ( entanglement)-characterize the specific \nkind of Being which belongs to falling. This 'movement' of Dasein in its \nown Being, we call its \"downward plunge\" [Absturz]. Dasein plunges out \nof itself into itself, into the groundlessness and nullity of inauthentic \neverydayness. But this plunge remains hidden from Dasein by 'the way \nthings have been publicly interpreted, so much so, indeed, that it gets \ninterpreted as a way of 'ascending' and 'living concretely'. \nThis downward plunge into and within the groundlessness of the in\u00ad\nauthentic Being of the \"they\", has a kind of motion which constantly \ntears the understanding away from the projecting of authentic possibil\u00ad\nities, and into the tranquilized supposition that it possesses everything, \nor that everything is within its reach. Since the understanding is thus \nconstantly torn away from authenticity and into the \"they\" (though \nalways with a sham of authenticity), the movement of falling is charac\u00ad\nterized by turbulence [Wirbel]. \nFalling is not only existentially determinative for Being-in-the-world. \n1 79 \nAt the same time turbulence makes manifest that the thrownness which \ncan obtrude itself upon Dasein in its state-of-mind, has the character of \nthrowing and of movement. Thrownness is neither a 'fact that is finished' \nnor a Fact that is settled.1 Dasein's facticity is such that as long as it is \nwhat it is, Dasein remains in the throw, and is sucked into the turbulence \nof the \"they's\" inauthenticity. Thrownness, in which facticity lets itself \nbe seen phenomenally, belongs to Dasein, for which, in its Being, that very \nBeing is an issue. Dasein exists factically. \nBut now that falling has been exhibited, have we not set forth a phe\u00ad\nnomenon which speaks directly against the definition we have used in \nindicating the formal idea of existence? Can Dasein be conceived as an \nentity for which, in its Being, its potentiality-for-Being is an issue, if this \nentity, in its very everydayness, has lost itself, and, in falling, 'lives' away \nfrom itself? But falling into the world would be phenomenal 'evidence' \nagainst the existentiality of Dasein only if Dasein were regarded as an \nisolated \"I\" or subject, as a self-point from which it moves away. In that \ncase, the world would be an Object. Falling into the world would then \nhave to be re-Interpreted ontologically as Being-present-at-hand in the \nmanner of an entity within-the-world. If, however, we keep in mind \n1 'Die Geworfenheit ist nicht nur nicht eine \"fertige Tatsache\", sondem auch nicht ein \nabgeschlossenes Faktum.' \n"

      "full_text": "Being and Time \n1. 6 \nCan we succeed in grasping this structural whole of Dasein's every\u00ad\ndayness in its totality ? Can Dasein's Being be brought out in such a \nunitary manner that in terms of it the essential equiprimordiality of the \nstructures we have pointed out, as well as their existential possibilities of \nmodification, will become intelligible ? Does our present approach via \nthe existential analytic provide us an avenue for arriving at this Being \nphenomenally? \nTo put it negatively, it is beyond question that the totality of the \nstructural whole is not to be reached by building it up out of elements. \nFor this we would need an architect's plan. The Being of Dasein, upon \nwhich the structural whole as such is ontologically supported, becomes \naccessible to us when we look all the way through this whole to a single \nprimordially unitary phenomenon which is already in this whole in such \na way that it provides the ontological foundation for each structural item \nin its structural possibility. Thus we canot Interpret this 'comprehen\u00ad\nsively' by a process of gathering up what we have hitherto gained and \ntaking it all together. The question of Dasein's basic existeniial character \nis essentially different from that of the Being of something present-at\u00ad\nhand. Our everyday environmental experiencing [Erfahren], which \nremains directed both ontically and ontologically towards entities within\u00ad\nthe-world, is not the sort of thing which can present Dasein in an ontically \nprimordial manner for ontological analysis. Similarly our immanent per-\n182 \nception of Experiences [Erlebnissen] fails to provide a clue which is \nontologically adequate. On the other hand, Dasein's Being is not be to \ndeduced from an idea of man. Does the Interpretation ofDasein which we \nhave hitherto given permit us to infer what Dasein,from its own standpoint, \ndemands as the only appropriate ontico-ontological way of access to itself? \nAn understanding of Being belongs to Dasein's ontological structure. \nAs something that is [Seiend], it is disclosed to itself in its Being. The \nkind of Being which belongs to this disclosedness is constituted by state\u00ad\nof-mind and understanding. Is there in Dasein an understanding state\u00ad\nof-mind in which Dasein has been disclosed to itself in some distinctive \nway? \nIf the existential analytic of Dasein is to retain clarity in principle as to \nits function in fundamental ontology, then in order to master its provis\u00ad\nional task of exhibiting Dasein's Being, it must seek for one of the most far\u00ad\nreaching and most primordial possibilities of disclosure-me that lies in \nDasein itself. The way of disclosure in which Dasein brings itself before \nitself must be such that in it Dasein becomes accessible as simplified in a \ncertain manner. With what is thus disclosed, the structural totality of the \nBeing we seek must then come to light in an elemental way. \n"
