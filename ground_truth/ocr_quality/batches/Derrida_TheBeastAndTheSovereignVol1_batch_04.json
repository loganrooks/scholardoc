      "full_text": "110  \u2021  fourth session\nembryo a few weeks old, destined after birth to live a short life \u2014 one day, \nfor example \u2014 and a life of mental and physical handicap \u2014 saving such a \nlife without the slightest future ought to come before the lives of millions, \nor an in\ufb01 nite number of living animals in full health and with a full future. \nWho will say that this choice really is possible or easy? Whatever reply one \nreally gives to this question, whatever decision one takes (and these are not \nabstract and arti\ufb01 cial examples, as one could show, decisions such as this \nare taken every day), what is certain is that in the humanist logic deployed \nby Lacan, the putting to death of the newborn, abandoning the newborn \nto its death, the failure to assist a person in danger that that represents, will \nbe judged to be criminal and cruel, whereas the killing of billions of beasts \nwould not be. The frontier is here qualitative and essential; numbers and \ntime do not count. There is no \u201ccrime against animality\u201d nor crime of geno-\ncide against nonhuman living beings.\n2. In the second place, the second upping of the ante: it is not enough to \nsay that this unconditional ethical obligation, if there is one, binds me to \nthe life of any living being in general. It also binds me twice over to some-\nthing nonliving, namely to the present nonlife or the nonpresent life of \nthose who are not living, present living beings, living beings in the pres-\nent, contemporaries \u2014 i.e. dead living beings and living beings not yet born, \n nonpresent- living- beings or living beings that are not present. One must \ntherefore inscribe death in the concept of life. And you can imagine all the \nconsequences this would have. Moreover, it is not certain that even in the \noriginary history or \ufb01 ction of the murder of the primal father according to \nwhich the  brother- sons subject themselves to the law because, says Freud, \nthe shame of their crime compels them to do so, it is not certain that this \nshame does not signify, always already, in its possibility, the bond of obliga-\ntion or debt with respect to the dead.\nB. Second complication. There are indeed \u201canimal rights\u201d: some national \nlegislations proscribe some acts of violence, some forms of torture or violence \ntoward animals; and there are, as you know, all sorts of likable associations \nin the world that would like to do more, to publish universal declarations of \nthe rights of animals analogous to the declaration of the rights of man. But, \nto put it brie\ufb02 y, the texts of existing laws only forbid certain forms of cruelty \nor torture, but they do not forbid the killing of animals in general, be it for \nthe production of meat for food, or for experimentation and dissection. The \nstruggle against certain forms of hunting and against bull\ufb01 ghting is under \nway and has little chance of getting very far for the moment. Killing an ani-\nmal, at any rate, is not held to be cruel in itself. As for the declarations of the \nrights of animals called for by some people, beyond the fact that they never \n \n158\n"

This is a major failure of logic, the principle of which I merely point \nout, there being no need to say anymore about it here. I prefer, since it is a \nmatter of the determination of man as person and personal subject, to look \nmore closely at what is implied here by this concept of subject, including, \nas to the animal, what becomes of it after the transformation or subversion \nthat Lacan imprints on the concept of the subject. You will recall that it was \nby what he called a \u201crecourse [. . .] to the subject\u201d that Lacan concluded the \narticle we were reading. Let me read that sentence again:\nif we can provide a more justly rigorous truth, let us not forget that we owe \nit to the following privileged function: that of the recourse of the subject to \nthe subject, which inscribes our duties in the order of eternal fraternity: its \nrule is also the rule of every action allowed us.\nWould it suf\ufb01 ce for an ethics to remind the subject (as L\u00e9vinas will have \nattempted) of its  being- subject, its  being- host or hostage, and thus its being-\n subject to the other, the Wholly Other or to any other [au Tout- Autre ou \u00e0 \ntout autre]?19\nI do not believe so.

In \u201cSubversion of the Subject and \nDialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious\u201d (1960),21 a certain passage \nnames \u201cthe animal\u201d or \u201can animal\u201d \u2014 in the singular and without further \nspeci\ufb01 cation. It marks perhaps both a step beyond and a step backward \nfrom Freud as to the relation between man, the unconscious, and what I \ncall the animot.22 This remarkable page \ufb01 rst gives the impression, and the \nhope, that things are going to change, especially as to the concept of com-\nmunication or information that is assigned to what is called the animal, the \nanimal in general. This \u201canimal\u201d is supposedly only capable, so one thinks, \nof a coded message or a narrowly signaling signi\ufb01 cation, under strict con-\nstraint: \ufb01 xed in its programming. Lacan begins to take on the \u201cplatitude\u201d \nof \u201cmodern information theory.\u201d It is true that he is speaking here of the \nhuman subject and not the animal, but he writes this, which indeed names \nthe sovereign as absolute Master but which seems to announce, and even \nallow one to hope for, a different note:\nThe Other, as prior site of the pure subject of the signi\ufb01 er, holds the  master-\n position in it, even before coming to existence \u2014 to say it with and against \nHegel \u2014 as absolute Master. For what is omitted in the platitude of mod-\nern information theory, is that one cannot even speak of a code unless it be \nchine, like the animal, supposedly cannot do, is not to emit signs but, says the Discourse \non Method (part 5), to \u201crespond.\u201d Like animals, machines that had \u201cthe organs and the \nexternal shape of a monkey [. . .] could not use words or other signs by composing them \nas we do to declare our thoughts to others. For we may well conceive of a machine so \nconstructed that it proffers words, and even words relating to bodily actions that cause \nsome change in its organs; so that if touched in a particular place, it might ask what one \nwishes to say to it, or in another, it might cry out that one is hurting it, and other similar \nthings; but not that it could arrange them diversely to respond [my emphasis\u2014J.D.] to \nthe meaning of everything said in its presence, as the dullest of men can do.\u201d [Transla-\ntor\u2019s note: my translation of Descartes.] \n21.

But it \nwould be ridiculous primarily for Lacan himself, perhaps, since he writes: \n\u201cAt the time of propedeutics, one can illustrate the effect of the enunciation \nby asking the pupil if he can imagine the unconscious in an animal, unless \nit be some effect of language: of human language.\u201d25\nEach word in this sentence would merit a critical examination. The the-\nsis is clear: the animal has neither the unconscious nor language, it does not \nhave the other, it has no relation to the other as such, except by an effect of \nthe human order, by contagion, appropriation, domestication.\nNo doubt taking into account the sexualizing specularity of the animal\nis a remarkable advance, even if it captures the animot in the mirror, and \neven if it holds the female pigeon or the desert locust in captivity in the \nimaginary. Referring at this point to the effects of a Gestalt attested to by a \n\u201cbiological experimentation\u201d which does not \ufb01 t with the language of \u201cpsy-\nchic causality,\u201d Lacan praises this theory for nonetheless recognizing that \nthe \u201cmaturation of the gonad in the female pigeon\u201d presupposes \u201cthe sight \nof a congeneric\u201d and therefore another pigeon, whatever its sex. And that is \ntrue to the point that simple re\ufb02 ection in a mirror suf\ufb01 ces. A visual image \nalso suf\ufb01 ces for the desert locust to pass from solitude to gregariousness. \nLacan speaks, in a way that I think signi\ufb01 cant, of passage from the \u201csoli-\ntary\u201d form to the \u201cgregarious\u201d form, and not to the social and still less po-\nlitical form, of course, as though the difference between the gregarious and \nthe social were the difference between animal and man.26 This motif and \nthis word \u201cgregarious,\u201d and even \u201cgregarism,\u201d reappear in force around ten \nyears later, around animality, in \u201cRemarks on Psychic Causality\u201d (1946),27 a \ntext at the end of which, moreover, Lacan claims that one cannot get beyond \nDescartes. The analysis of the specular effect in the pigeon is more devel-\noped but goes in the same direction: the ovulation of the female pigeon, \naccording to then recent work by Harrison (1939),28 happens on mere sight \nof a form that suggests a congeneric pigeon, a re\ufb02 ecting sight, basically, \neven in the absence of a real male.

It happens after twelve \ndays when the couple is heterosexual, as it were, and after a period that can \nbe as long as two months for two females. A mirror is enough to make it \nhappen.29\nOne of the interesting things about this interpretation, is that, like Des-\ncartes basically, and according to this tried-and-true  biblico- Promethean \ntradition to which I keep returning, it puts in relation the \ufb01 xity of animal \ndeterminism, in the order of information or communication, with a certain \noriginary perfection of the animal.

The insect cannot respond to other characteristics, nor can it dismiss targets \nthat show characteristics incompatible with the expected function. It cannot abandon \nits \ufb02 ight when it \u2018perceives\u2019 that it is not following a female. This insect appears to have \nno means of evaluating how correct its own perceptions are. It therefore seems unduly \ngenerous to attribute to it an intentional capacity properly so called. It responds to signs, but \nthese signs are not characteristics of an independent object; they are characteristics of \nproximal stimulations. As Millikan says, it follows a \u2018proximal rule.\u2019 However, the pre-\nwired response has as its aim the fecundation of a female syrphid, i.e. an object existing \nin the world\u201d (pp. 228\u201329). I emphasize the words that, more than others, would call for \na vigilant reading. The critical or deconstructive reading that we are calling for would \nseek less to give back to the animal or to such and such an insect the powers here being \ndenied it (even though that sometimes seems possible) <than> to wonder if the same \ntype of analysis could not claim just as much relevance in the case of man, for example \nin the \u201cwiring\u201d of his sexual and reproductive behavior.

Finally, the point would be to elaborate another \u201clogic\u201d of decision, \nresponse, event \u2014 as I also try to deploy it elsewhere and which seems to \nme less incompatible with what Lacan himself, in \u201cSubversion of the Sub-\nject . . . ,\u201d says of the code as \u201ccode of the Other.\u201d Meaning that Other from \nwhom \u201cthe subject receives even the message he emits.\u201d39 This axiom ought \nto complicate any simple distinction between responsibility and reaction, with \nall its consequences. And so the point would be to reinscribe this diff\u00e9rance \nof reaction and response and thereby this historicity of ethical, juridical, \nor political responsibility, into another thinking of life, living beings, into \nanother relation of the living to their ipseity, and thereby to their supposed \nsovereignty, their autos, their own autokinesis and reactional automaticity, \nto death, to technique, or to the machinic.\nAfter this detour, if we come then to the later text entitled \u201cSubversion \nof the Subject and Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious,\u201d we \nwill, it is true, follow the same logic in it, and the same oppositions \u2014 espe-\ncially the opposition of imaginary and symbolic, of the specular capture of \nwhich the animal is capable and the symbolic order of the signi\ufb01 er to which \nit does not have access. At this juncture of the imaginary and the symbolic, \nthe whole question of the relation to self in general is played out, the posi-\ntion of the self, the ego and sovereign ipseity of course, but also the position \nof the theoretician or the institution in the history of which said theoreti-\ncian articulates and signs his discourse on that juncture: here Lacan\u2019s dis-\ncourse and its signature.

And, above all, in an entirely \nlegitimate way, beyond biologism, behaviorist physicalism, geneticism, etc. \nFor Heidegger as for Lacan and so many others, the point at that time was \nto lay out a new fundamental anthropology and to reply to and for the ques-\ntion \u201cWhat is man?\u201d This moment has not at all been left behind, it is even \nputting forward new forms of the same dangers.)\nIn \u201cSubversion of the Subject . . . ,\u201d the re\ufb01 nement of the analysis bears \non other conceptual distinctions. They seem equally problematic to me as \nthose we have just been analyzing and, moreover, remain indissociable \nfrom them.\nWe are dealing apparently with a parenthesis (\u201cLet us observe in a pa-\nrenthesis . . .\u201d), but a parenthesis that to my eyes is capital. For it bears \non the dimension of testimony in general. Who testi\ufb01 es about what and \nwhom? Who proves, who looks, who observes whom and what? What \nabout knowl edge, certainty, and truth? \u201cLet us observe in parentheses,\u201d \nsays Lacan, \u201cthat this Other distinguished as place of Speech, imposes it-\nself no less as witness of Truth. Without the dimension that it constitutes, \ntrickery in speech would not be distinguishable from mere feint, which, in \ncombat or sexual display, is however very different.\u201d40\nThe \ufb01 gure of the animal, then, has just emerged in this difference be-\ntween feint and trickery. Recall what we were saying about Machiavelli, \nabout the prince and the fox, and about the fox that feigns not being the \nfox that it is or even that it is imitating. I am not a fox, the prince can say, \nbasically, the prince who is not really a fox but who is acting like a fox, \nwho knows how to feign being a fox all the while feigning not to feign and \ntherefore not to be the fox that he basically is in what he says or does. Lacan \nwould say that only a prince or a man is capable of this, not a fox. A clean \ndistinction between what Lacan says the animal is able to do, i.e. strategic \nfeint (following, chasing, or persecuting, be it warlike, predatory, or seduc-\ntive), and what it is unable to do and testify to, namely the trickery of speech \nin the order of the signi\ufb01 er and of Truth. The trickery of speech, as we \nshall see, is of course the lie (and the animal cannot really lie, according to \ncommon sense, according to Lacan and many others, even if, as we know, it \nknows how to feign); but, more precisely, trickery is lying insofar as it com-\nprises, in promising the truth, the supplementary possibility of speaking the \ntruth in order to mislead the other, to make the other believe something \nother than the truth (you know the Jewish joke told by Freud and often \n40.

According to Lacan, it is this lie, this \ntrickery, this  second- degree feint that the animal is unable to do, whereas \nthe \u201csubject of the signi\ufb01 er,\u201d in the human order, supposedly has the power \nto do so and, moreover, supposedly comes into being as a subject, institutes \nand comes to itself as sovereign subject by virtue of this power: a re\ufb02 exive \n second- degree power, a conscious power of trickery through feigning to \nfeign. One of the interesting things about this analysis is that Lacan really \ndoes concede a lot, this time \u2014 more in any case than anyone in philos-\nophy and more than he himself had done in earlier writings \u2014 to this abil-\nity to feign on the part of what he always calls \u201cthe animal,\u201d \u201can animal,\u201d \non the part of what he terms here its \u201cdancity,\u201d with an \u201ca.\u201d41 \u201cDancity\u201d is \nthe ability to feign in dance, lure, display, in the choreography of hunting \nor seduction, in the display shown before making love or to defend oneself \nwhen making war, and so in all the forms of the \u201cI am\u201d or \u201cI am followed\u201d \nthat we are tracking here. But whatever he concedes to the animal in this \nway, Lacan holds it in the imaginary or the presymbolic (as we noted in his \n\u201cMirror- Stage\u201d period and in the example of the pigeon or the desert lo-\ncust). He holds \u201cthe animal\u201d prisoner in the specularity of the imaginary; or \nrather he holds that the animal holds itself in this captivity and speaks with \nreference to it of \u201cimaginary capture.\u201d Above all, he holds the animal down \nto the \ufb01 rst degree of feigning (feigning without feigning feigning) or, what \ncomes to the same thing here, to the \ufb01 rst degree of the trace: ability to trace, \ntrack, track down [d\u00e9pister], but not to throw the tracking off track [d\u00e9- pister \nle d\u00e9- pistage] and to efface its track.\nFor a \u201cBut\u201d will indeed fold this paragraph in two (\u201cBut an animal does not \nfeign feigning\u201d). An accounting separates out the columns of what must be \nconceded to the animal (feint and trace, the inscription of the trace) and what \nmust be denied it (trickery, lying, the feint of the feint, and the effacement \nof the trace). But \u2014 what the articulation of this \u201cBut\u201d perhaps leaves out \nof sight, discreetly in the shade, among all the features listed, is perhaps the \nreference to life, to the \u201cvital.\u201d And it is indeed the question of life that is oc-\ncupying us in this seminar, before all and after all, between the beast and the \nsovereign. Everything conceded to the animal is done so under the heading \nof \u201cvital situations,\u201d whereas \u2014 one would be tempted to conclude \u2014 the \nanimal, be it hunter or game, is deemed be incapable of an authentic rela-\n41.

The supposedly established difference \nbetween pister and d\u00e9pister, or rather between d\u00e9pister (to trace or follow a trail) and d\u00e9-\npister (to erase a trail or voluntarily lead the follower astray), gathers and guarantees the \nwhole distinction between human and animal according to Lacan. This distinction only \nhas to tremble for the whole axiomatic to be ruined, in its very principle. This is what \nwe are going to have to clarify.\n173 \n"

I must for now leave hanging the question of \nknowing whether, in the texts that followed or in seminars (published or \nnot, accessible or inaccessible), the frame of this logic was explicitly reexam-\nined. Especially when the oppositional distinction between the imaginary \nand the symbolic, which forms the very axiomatics of this discourse on the \nanimal, seems to be increasingly left to one side, if not rejected, by Lacan. \nAs always, I am trying to take into account the strongest systematic orga-\nnization of a discourse in the form in which it gathers itself at a relatively \ndeterminable moment of its process. Spanning thirty years, the various texts \ngathered in one volume, the \u00c9crits, strongly bound to itself, give us in this \nrespect a reliable hold and path to follow. Among the published and acces-\nsible texts that follow the \u00c9crits, one should, in particular, try to follow the \npath that leads, interestingly but I believe without a break, to the analyses \nof animal mimeticism, for example, always from the point of view of view, \nfrom that of the image and the \u201cseeing oneself looked at,\u201d even by a can of \nsardines that can\u2019t see me (\u201cFirst, if it means anything when Petit- Jean says \nbrought to bear on the parricidal brothers according to the logic of Totem and Taboo. \nIn many places, Lacan certainly dreams of an other fraternity, for example in these \ufb01 nal \nwords of \u201cAggressivity in Psychoanalysis\u201d: \u201cIt is to this being of nothingness that it is \nour daily task to open anew the way of his meaning in a discreet fraternity to which we \nnever measure up\u201d (\u00c9crits, p. 124 [p. 101]).\n178 \n"

The animal can trace, inscribe, or \nleave tracks, but, Lacan adds, it \u201cdoes not efface its tracks, which would \nalready mean that it became the subject of the signi\ufb01 er.\u201d Now here too, \neven supposing that we rely on this distinction, Lacan justi\ufb01 es neither by \ntestimony nor by ethological knowledge the assertion whereby \u201cthe ani-\nmal,\u201d as he says, the animal in general, does not efface its tracks. Beyond \nthe fact that, as I had tried to show elsewhere (and this is why, so long ago, \nI had substituted the concept of trace for that of signi\ufb01 er), the structure of \nthe trace presupposes that to trace comes down to effacing a trace as much \nas imprinting it, all sorts of animal practices, sometimes ritual practices, for \nexample in burial and mourning, associate the experience of the trace and \nthat of the effacing of the trace. A feint, moreover, and even a simple feint, \nconsists in rendering a sensory trace unreadable or imperceptible. How \ncould one deny that the simple substitution of one trace for another, the \nmarking of their diacritical difference in the most elementary inscription, \nthe one Lacan concedes to the animal, involves effacement as much as im-\nprinting? It is just as dif\ufb01 cult to assign a frontier between feint and feigned \nfeint, to draw an indivisible line through the middle of a feigned feint, as it \nis to distinguish inscription from effacement of the trace.\nBut let us go further, and ask a type of question that I should have liked, \ngiven time, to generalize. It is less a matter of wondering whether one has \nthe right to refuse the animal such and such a power (speech, reason, experi-\nence of death, mourning, culture, institution, politics, technique, clothing, \nlying, feigned feint, effacement of the trace, gift, laughter, tears, respect, \netc. \u2014 the list is necessarily inde\ufb01 nite, and the most powerful philosophi-\ncal tradition in which we live has refused all of that to the \u201canimal\u201d). It is \nmore a matter of wondering whether what one calls man has the right, for \nhis own part, to attribute in all rigor to man, to attribute to himself, then, \nwhat he refuses to the animal, and whether he ever has a concept of it that \nis pure, rigorous, indivisible, as such. Thus, even supposing, concesso non dato, \nthat the \u201canimal\u201d is incapable of effacing its traces, by what right should \none concede this power to man, to the \u201csubject of the signi\ufb01 er\u201d? And es-\npecially from a psychoanalytic point of view? Any man may certainly be \nconscious, within a space of doxic phenomenality, of effacing his traces. But \nwho will ever judge the ef\ufb01 cacy of this gesture? Do we need to recall that \nany effaced trace, in consciousness, can leave a trace of its effacement the \n \n182\n"

In it, Lacan shares out praise and \ncriticism.\nOn the one hand, the \u201cCartesian cogito does not fail to recognize\u201d the es-\nsential, namely that consciousness of existence, the sum, is not immanent to \nit but transcendent, and therefore beyond specular or imaginary capture. \nThis comes down to con\ufb01 rming that an animal cogito remains a captive \nof the identi\ufb01 catory image, a situation one could formalize by saying that \nthe animal accedes to the ego, the \u201cme,\u201d only by missing the \u201cI,\u201d but an \u201cI\u201d \nthat itself accedes to the signi\ufb01 er only on the basis of a lack: the (animal) self \nlacks the lack. Lacan writes, for example:\nThe ego is thenceforth a function of mastery, a play at being imposing, a \nconstituted rivalry [so many features that are not refused to the animal]. In \nthe capture that it undergoes from its imaginary nature, it masks its duplic-\nity, i.e. that the consciousness in which it assures itself of an incontestable \nexistence (a na\u00efvet\u00e9 to be found deployed in the meditation of a F\u00e9nelon) \nis in no way immanent to it, but indeed transcendent since it sustains itself \non the basis of the unary trait of the ego- ideal (which the Cartesian cogito \ndoes not fail to realize). Whereby the transcendental ego itself is relativ-\nized, implicated as it is in the misrecognition in which are inaugurated the \nidenti\ufb01 cations of the ego.55\nBut, on the other hand, the ego cogito is dislodged from its position as central \nsubject. It loses mastery, central power, and becomes a subject subjected to \nthe signi\ufb01 er.\nThe imaginary process moves thus from the specular image to \u201cthe \nconstitution of the ego on the road of subjectivation by the signi\ufb01 er.\u201d This \nseems to con\ufb01 rm that the  becoming- subject of the ego passes via the sig-\nni\ufb01 er, Speech, the Truth, etc., i.e. by losing immediate transparency, con-\nsciousness as consciousness of a self- identical self. Which leads to an only \napparent paradox: the subject is con\ufb01 rmed in the eminence of its power by \nsubverting it and bringing it back to its defect, namely that animality is on \nthe side of the conscious ego, whereas the humanity of the human subject is \non the side of the unconscious, the law of the signi\ufb01 er, Speech, the feigned \nfeint, etc.:\nThe promotion of consciousness as essential to the subject in the historical \naftermath of the Cartesian cogito is for us the misleading accentuation of \nthe transparency of the \u201cI\u201d in actu at the expense of the opacity of the signi-\n55. \u201cSubversion of the Subject . . . ,\u201d p. 809 [p. 685].\n \n184\n"

The least one can say is that the psychoanalysts, even Jung [this \n\u201ceven Jung\u201d emphasizes and recalls that Deleuze is one of few, on a cer-\ntain French scene, regularly to declare an admiring interest in Jung], have \nnot understood or have not wanted to understand [Deleuze insinuates in \nthis way that all these psychoanalysts have denied understanding, have be-\nhaved as though they did not understand, wanted not to understand what, \nconsequently, they understood perfectly well and found it in their interests \nnot to take on, admit, declare what they understood, what they understood \nthat they understood and still wanted not to understand, wanted to pretend \nthey did not understand, what is more a symptom than a simple failure \nof learning or knowledge: a symptomatic misrecognition on the basis of \nan unconscious knowledge. And this active, symptomatic misrecognition \nis a piece of bad treatment, even a violent and cruel mistreatment of the \n becoming- animal of man and child, a cruel violence]. They massacred the \n becoming- animal, in the adult and in the child. They saw nothing. In the ani-\nmal, they see a representative of the drives or a representation of the par-\nents. They do not see the reality of a  becoming- animal, how it is the affect \nitself, the drive in person, and represents nothing.

This is where the word b\u00ea tise imposes itself on him, this \ntime describing discourses of a psychoanalytic type. \u201cPsychoanalysis has no \nsense of the unnatural participations or the assemblages that a child can \nbuild [machines, then] in order to resolve a problem whose exits have been \nbarred for him [so the  becoming- animal would here be a ruse, a machina-\ntion, a war- machine to escape, to undo a snare, a machine built to dismantle \nanother machine]\u201d:\nPsychoanalysis has no sense of the unnatural participations or the assem-\nblages that a child can build in order to resolve a problem whose exits have \nbeen barred for him: a plane, not a fantasy [critique, then, of the idea of \nfantasy as natural representer of a deeper and also natural drive, for which \nDeleuze intends to substitute the more technical, more machinic, less natu-\nral, more horizontal and \ufb02 atter, planer \ufb01 gure of plane.

At bottom, I shall try later to say \nlater why and in what way, in my view we will never manage to isolate \na univocal meaning of the concept of b\u00ea tise, in its irreducible link to the \nFrench language. If it is indeed a category, b\u00ea tise, both an accusation and an \nattribution, an attribute, a predicate, a predication, and if this category does \nnot belong to the regime or the normal series of categories, if it is indeed an \nexceptional and transcategorial category, then it really does answer to the \n\ufb01 rst literal de\ufb01 nition of the transcendental in the Middle Ages, well before \nKant: \u201cqui transcendit omne genus,\u201d a category that transcends all categories \nand thus does not belong to the series or table of categories. B\u00ea tise would \nhere be in the position of a transcategorial category, a transcendental or, as \nI would say, a  quasi- transcendental. And we should have to draw all the \nconsequences from this.\nTo which I shall add, since I have just used the word \u201ccategorial\u201d and \nbecause the word \u201ccategorial\u201d is also the word that Heidegger uses, in Sein \nund Zeit, to designate the concepts that concern the ontological structures \nof the entity that is not Dasein, i.e. Vorhandensein and Zuhandensein (Hei-\ndegger calls <what concerns> the analysis and the concepts that refer to \nDasein \u201cexistentiell\u201d and not \u201ccategorial\u201d) \u2014 to which I shall add that one \ncould, without it being unduly arti\ufb01 cial, wonder whether the analysis of \nb\u00ea tise, as a predicate of man or Dasein but referring (in French at least) to \nsomething nonhuman (the beast), whether the analysis of this unstable and \nambiguous signi\ufb01 cation, of this structure both human and inhuman, comes \nunder the categorical or the existentiell. Obviously, Heidegger never even \ndreamed of proposing an ontological analysis of b\u00ea tise, and no one will be \nsurprised at that, but we will soon rediscover the use (categorical, i.e. accu-\nsatory, in truth autoaccusatory) he made of a word that is often translated, \nrightly or wrongly, by b\u00ea tise, namely Dummheit. I close here provisionally \nthis long parenthesis.)\nBack to kate\u00afgoreuo\u00af, which in Greek means to decry, accuse, blame, accuse \nin legal proceedings, speak against, of course; but it also has the logical or \nepistemological meaning of \u201cmake known, reveal, determine by making \naccessible, visible, and knowable\u201d \u2014 to attribute, to say something about \nsomeone or something. \u201cS is P\u201d is to categorize: and the kate\u00afgoria is both \nthe quality attributed, the attribute, the predicate, and the accusation (in \nopposition to the apology, apologia, which signi\ufb01 es conversely praise or de-\nfense, justi\ufb01 cation). How the passage and the af\ufb01 nity works, between at-\ntribution and accusation, between the neutral generality of this is that, \u201cS is \nP,\u201d and the accusation, denigration, disquali\ufb01 cation (it is bad for S to be P), \n208 \n"

Deleuze\u2019s gesture remains, however, spe-\nci\ufb01 c, and to follow the reasoning that leads him to say that b\u00ea tise, as proper \nto man, is never that of someone else, we can follow a trajectory that has \nhim associate b\u00ea tise with three motifs that interest us here more especially:\n1. The \ufb01 gure of sovereignty called \u201ctyranny\u201d (remember the text from \nthe Republic about the tyrant and the wolf, which we were discussing at the \nvery beginning);\n2. Cruelty (cruel bestiality, which we were talking about last week and \nhave been for years in this seminar);\n3. Finally, and indispensably for attributing b\u00ea tise to man, and under-\nstanding the link with philosophy, b\u00ea tise as a matter of thought and of the \nthinking being that man is (it being understood that animal or beast is not \nsuch a thinking being). B\u00ea tise is a thinking, b\u00ea tise is thoughtful, a thinking \nand thoughtful freedom. It is in this link of thought and individuation that \nDeleuze is about to uncover the mainspring of b\u00ea tise, which always presup-\nposes a relation with what he calls the ground, in the tradition of Schelling, \nwhom he cites in a note,18 Schelling the author of the Philosophical Investi-\n18.

Is stu-\npidity b\u00ea tise? Is it exactly the same thing? We are coming to this.\nTo get back to Deleuze, only the experience of freedom that b\u00ea tise is, as \nhuman freedom, only this freedom as relation to the groundless ground, \ncan explain not only how b\u00ea tise can be foreign to \u201canimals,\u201d but how it can \nbe linked to those three motifs I pointed out a moment ago, namely sover-\neignty, cruelty (and therefore evil \u2014 and illness, Schelling would say), and \n\ufb01 nally thought.\n1. Sovereignty in the \ufb01 gure of the tyrant \ufb01 rst. Deleuze notes that\nthe tyrant has the head not only of an ox, but of a pear, a cabbage, or a po-\ntato. No one is ever superior or exterior to what he pro\ufb01 ts from: the tyrant \ninstitutionalizes b\u00ea tise, but he is the \ufb01 rst servant of his system and the \ufb01 rst \nto be instituted, always a slave commanding slaves.27 [A literally Platonic \nmotif.]28\n2. <Next,> Deleuze is particularly eloquent and insistent on evil and cru-\nelty and their essential link with b\u00ea tise. This is consistent with the gesture \nthat makes of b\u00ea tise the phenomenon of freedom as human freedom. What \nis remarkable is that the distinction between b\u00ea tise and error remains the es-\nsential condition of this whole interpretation and problematic. For Deleuze \nwrites:\n24.
