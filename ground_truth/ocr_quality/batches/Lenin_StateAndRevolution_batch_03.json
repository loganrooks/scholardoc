But there exists one almost unknown fact \nwhich must not be overlooked if we set ourselves the task of \ninvestigating how Kautsky slid into the unbelievably disgraceful \nconfusion and defence of social-chauvinism at the time of very \ngreat crisis in 1914-15. This fact is as follows: before he came out \nagainst the most prominent representatives of opportunism in \nFrance (Millerand and Jaures) and in Germany (Bernstein), Kaut\u00ad\nsky displayed very sharp vacillations. The Marxist journal, Zarya, \nwhich was published in Stuttgart in 1901-2 and advocated revo\u00ad\nlutionary proletarian views, was compelled to polemicize with Kaut\u00ad\nsky and to characterize as \u2018rubbery\u2019 the half-hearted and evasive \nresolution which was conciliatory towards the opportunists and \nwhich he proposed at the International Socialist Congress in Paris \nin 1900. Kautsky\u2019s letters published in Germany revealed no less \nvacillation on his part before he campaigned against Bernstein.\nOf immeasurably greater significance, however, is the fact that, \nin his very polemic with the opportunists, in his formulation of the \nquestion and his manner of dealing with it, we can now observe, as \nwe investigate the history of Kautsky\u2019s latest betrayal of Marxism, \nhis systematic deviation towards opportunism precisely on the ques\u00ad\ntion of the state.\nLet us take Kautsky\u2019s first important work against opportunism, \nhis book Bernstein and the Social-Democratic Programme. Kautsky \nrefutes Bernstein in detail. But there is the following characteristic \naspect to this.\nBernstein in his Premises of Socialism, which has gained Hero- \nstratean notoriety, lays the accusation of 'Blanquism \u2019 against Marx\u00ad\nism (an accusation subsequently repeated thousands of times by \nthe opportunists and the bourgeois liberals in Russia against the \nrepresentatives of revolutionary Marxism, the Bolsheviks). Here \nBernstein dwells particularly on Marx\u2019s The Civil War in France, \nand tries - quite unsuccessfully, as we have seen - to identify \nMarx\u2019s viewpoint on the lessons of the Commune with the view\u00ad\npoint of Proudhon.

But Bernstein gives the impres\u00ad\nsion that these words of Marx were written to warn the working \nclass against excessive revolutionary zeal when seizing power.\nA cruder and more hideous distortion of Marx\u2019s idea is inconceiv\u00ad\nable.\nHow, then, did Kautsky proceed in his most detailed refutation \nof Bernsteinism?\nHe shrank away from analysing the depths plumbed by opportun\u00ad\nism in distorting Marxism on this point. He cited the above-quoted \nexcerpt from Engels\u2019s introduction to Marx\u2019s Civil War and said \nthat, according to Marx, the working class cannot simply lay hold \nof the ready-made state machine but that generally it can lay hold \nof it - and he left the matter at that.
