It always has the role of mediation and communication: it transmits sonic\nvibrations to the chain of small bones, and then to the inner ear. Bichat recognized\nthat it has another paradoxical function. This small hone protects the tympanum\nwhile acting upon it. \"Without it, the tvmpanum would be affected painfully by\nvibrations set up by too powerful sounds.\" The hammer, thus, can weaken the\nblows, muffle them on the threshold of the inner ear.

Such, at least, is the most insistent\nhypothesis of this book. A quasi-organizing role\nis granted, therefore, to the motif of sonic vibration\n(the Hegelian Erzittern) as to the motif of the prox-\nimity of the meaning of Being in speech (Heideg-\ngerian Nahe and Ereignis). The logic of the event\nis examined from the vantage of the structures of\nexpropriation called timbre (tympanum), style, and\nsignature. Timbre, style, and signature are the same\nobliterating division of the proper. They make\nevery event possible, necessary, and unfindable.\nWhat is the specific resistance of philosophical\ndiscourse to deconstruction? It is the infinite mas-\ntery that the agency of Being (and of the) proper\nseems to assure it; this mastery permits it to in-\nteriorize every limit as being and as being its own\nproper. To exceed it, by the same token, and there-\nfore to preserve it in itself.

This is precisely because I would\nlike to attempt, to a certain extent, and even though in principle and in the last\nanalysis this is impossible, and impossible for essential reasons, to reassemble\nin a sheaf the different directions in which I have been able to utilize what I\nwould call provisionally the word or concept of differance, or rather to let it\nimpose itself upon me in its neographism, although as we shall see, di \u00e9rance\na word\nconcet. And I insist upon the word s iea for\ntwo reasons. On the one hand, I will not be concerned, as I might have been,\nwith describing a history and narrating its stages, text by text, context by context,\ndemonstrating the economy that each time imposed this graphic disorder; rather,\nI will be concerned with the genera! system of this economy. On the other hand,\nthe word sheaf seems to mark more appropriately that the assemblage to be\nproposed has the complex structure of a weaving, an interlacing which permits\nthe different threads and different lines of meaning\u2014or of force\u2014to go off again\nin different directions, just as it is always ready to tie itself up with others.\nTherefore, preliminarily, let me recall that this discreet graphic intervention,\nwhich neither primarily nor simply aims to shock the reader or the grammarian,\ncame to be formulated in the course of a written investigation of a question\nabout writing. Now it happens, I would say in effect, that this graphic difference\n(a instead of e), this marked difference between two apparently vocal notations,\nbetween two vowels, remains purely graphic: itis read, or it is written, but it\ncannot be heard. It cannot be apprehended in speech, and we will see whyif\n3\n"

Diff\u00e9rer in this sense is to temporize, to take recourse,\nconsciously or unconsciously, in the temporal and temporizing mediation of a\ndetour that suspends the accomplishment or fulfillment of \"desire\" or \"will,\"\nand equally effects this suspension in a mode that annuls or tempers its own\neffect. And we will see, later, how this temporization is also temporalization and\nspacing, the becoming-time of space and the becoming-space of time, the \"or-\niginary constitution\" of time and space, as metaphysics or transcendental phe-\nnomenology would say, to use the language that here is criticized and displaced.\nThe other sense of differer is the more common and identifiable one: to be not\nidentical, to be other, discernible, etc. When dealing with differen(ts)(ds), a word\nthat can be written with a final ts or a final ds, as you will, whether it is a question\nof dissimilar otherness or of allergic and polemical othemess, \u00e0\u00f1ititerval, a\ndistance, spacing, must be produced between the elements other, and be pro-\nduced with a certain perseverence in repetition.8\nthe word difference (with an e) can never refer either to differer as tem-\nporization or to diff\u00e9rends as polemos.9 Thus the word difference (with an a) is to\ncompensate\u2014economically\u2014this loss of meaning, for differance can refer simul-\ntaneously to the entire\nof its meanings. It is immediately and\nirreducibly polysemic, which will not be indifferent to the economy of my dis-\ncourse here. In its polysemia this word, of course, like any meaning, must defer\nto the discourse in which it occurs, its interpretive context; but in a way it defers\nitself, or at least does so more readily than any other word, the a immediately\nderiving from the present participle (differant), thereby bringing us close to the\nvery action of the verb differer, before it has even produced an effect constituted\nsomething different or as difference (with an e).'\u00b0 In a conceptuality adhering\n8. TN. The next few sentences will require some annotation, to be found in this note\nand the next two. In this sentence Derrida is pointing out that two words that sound\nexactly alike in French (diff\u00e9rents, diff\u00e9rends) refer to the sense of differre that implies spacing,\notherness\u2014difference in its usual English sense. Les diff\u00e9rents are different things; les\ndiff\u00e9rends are differences of opinion, grounds for dispute\u2014whence the references to allergy\n(from the Greek allos, other) and polemics.\n9. TN. However, to continue the last note, difference (in French) does not convey the\nsense of active putting off, of deferring (diff\u00e9rance in what would be its usual sense in\nFrench, if it were a word in common usage), or the sense of active polemical difference,\nactively differing with someone or something. (\"Active\" here, though, is not really correct,\nFor reasons that Derrida will explain below.) The point is that there is no noun-verb, no\ngerund for either sense in French.\n10. TN. Such a gerund would normally be constructed from the present participle of\nthe verb: diffCrant. Curiously then, the noun differance suspends itself between the two\nsenses of diff\u00e9rant\u2014deferring, differing. We might say that it defers differing, and differs\nfrom deferring, in and of itself.\n8\n"

We must consider that in the usage\nof our language the ending -ance remains undecided between the active and the\npassive.

What I am\ndescribing here in order to define it is the classically determined structure of the\nsign in all the banality of its characteristics\u2014signification as the differance of\ntemporization. And this structure presupposes that the sign, which defers pres-\nence, is conceivable only on the basis of the presence that it defers and moving\ntoward the deferred presence that it aims to reappropriate. According to this\nclassical semiology, the substitution of the sign for the thing itself is both secondary\nand provisional: secondary due to an original and lost presence from which the\nsign thus derives; provisional as concerns this final and missing presence towardJ\nwhich the sign in this sense is a movement of mediation.\nIn attempting to put into question these traits of the provisional secondariness\nof the substitute, one would come to see somethin1 like an originary diff\u00e9rance;\nbut one could no longer call it originary orlinal in the exi\nowhich the values\nof origin, archi-, telos, eslclia ton, etc. have always denoted presence\u2014ousia, par-\nousia.\" To put into question the secondary and provisional characteristics of the\nI 1.TN.
