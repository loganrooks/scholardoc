The in\ufb01nite detour.\nWay of God. \u201cYukel, speak to us of the man who is a lie in God\u201d (p. 94).\nThis way, preceded by no truth, and thus lacking the prescription of\ntruth\u2019s rigor, is the way through the Desert. Writing is the moment of\nthe desert as the moment of Separation. As their name indicates\u2014in\nAramaic\u2014the Pharisees, those misunderstood men of literality, were\nalso \u201cseparated ones.\u201d God no longer speaks to us; he has interrupted\nhimself: we must take words upon ourselves.

Writing is displaced\non the broken line between lost and promised speech. The di\ufb00erence\nbetween speech and writing is sin, the anger of God emerging from\nitself, lost immediacy, work outside the garden. \u201cThe garden is speech,\nthe desert writing. In each grain of sand a sign surprises\u201d (p. 169). The Judaic\nexperience as re\ufb02ection, as separation of life and thought, signi\ufb01es the\ncrossing of the book as an in\ufb01nite anchoritism placed between two\nimmediacies and two self-identi\ufb01cations. \u201cYukel, how many pages to live, how\nmany to die, separate you from yourself, separate you from the book to the abandoning\nof the book?\u201d (p. 44).

Reb Alc\u00e9\u201d (p. 122).\nIf absence is the heart of the question, if separation can emerge only\nin the rupture of God\u2014with God\u2014if the in\ufb01nite distance of the Other is\nrespected only within the sands of a book in which wandering and\nmirages are always possible, then Le livre des questions is simultaneously\nthe interminable song of absence and a book on the book.

Despite\nthe most profound dissimilarities, the appeal to tradition\u2014which is in\nno way traditional\u2014is shaped by an intention common to Husserlian\nphenomenology and to what we will call provisionally, by approxima-\ntion and for reasons of economy, Heideggerean \u201contology.\u201d3\nThus, very brie\ufb02y:\n1. The entirety of philosophy is conceived on the basis of its Greek\nsource. As is well known, this amounts neither to an occidental-\nism, nor to a historicism.4 It is simply that the founding concepts\nof philosophy are primarily Greek, and it would not be possible to\nphilosophize, or to speak philosophically, outside this medium.\nThat Plato, for Husserl, was the founder of a reason and a philo-\nsophical task whose telos was still sleeping in the shadows; or that\nfor Heidegger, on the contrary, Plato marks the moment at which\nthe thought of Being forgets itself and is determined as\nphilosophy\u2014this di\ufb00erence is decisive only at the culmination of\na common root which is Greek. The di\ufb00erence is fraternal in its\nposterity, entirely submitted to the same domination. Domination\nof the same too, which will disappear neither in phenomenology\nnor in \u201contology.\u201d\n2. The archaeology to which Husserl and Heidegger lead us by dif-\nferent paths entails, for both, a subordination or transgression, in\nany event a reduction of metaphysics. Even though, for each, this\ngesture has an entirely di\ufb00erent meaning, or at least does so\napparently.\n3. Finally, the category of the ethical is not only dissociated from\nmetaphysics but coordinated with something other than itself, a\nprevious and more radical function. When ethics is not treated this\nway, when law, the power of resolution, and the relationship to\nthe other are once more part of the archia, they lose their ethical\nspeci\ufb01city.5\nwriting and difference\n100\n"

Especially as concerns the violence implicit in\nphenomenology.\n(b) Next, it is di\ufb03cult to overlook the fact that Husserl so little pre-\ndetermined Being as object that in Ideas I absolute existence is\naccorded only to pure consciousness. True, it has often been\nargued that the di\ufb00erence hardly counts, and that a philosophy of\nconsciousness is always a philosophy of the object. Levinas\u2019s read-\ning of Husserl on this point has always been nuanced, supple,\ncontrasted. As early as in the Theory of Intuition, theory is correctly\ndistinguished from objectivity in general. As we shall see later,\npractical, axiological, etc., consciousness is for Husserl too a\nconsciousness of the object. Levinas openly acknowledges this.\nTherefore, the accusation is really directed against the irreducible\nprimacy of the subject-object correlation. But, later, Levinas will\ninsist more and more on those aspects of Husserlian phenomen-\nology which take us to the inner or outer reaches of the \u201csubject-\nobject correlation.\u201d For example, this would be \u201cintentionality\nas a relationship with otherness,\u201d as an \u201cexteriority which is\nnot objective,\u201d sensibility, passive genesis, the movement of\ntemporalization, etc.11\n(c) Further, for Levinas the sun of the epekeina tes ousias will always\nilluminate the pure awakening and inexhaustible source of\nthought (TI, p.127). It is not only the Greek ancestor of the In\ufb01nite\nwhich transcends totality (the totality of being or of noema, the\ntotality of the same or the ego),12 but is also the instrument of\ndestruction for the phenomenology and ontology subjected to the\nneutral totality of the Same as Being or as Ego.

In 1947 Levinas calls this movement, which is\nnot theological, not a transcendence toward \u201ca superior exist-\nence,\u201d \u201cex-cendence.\u201d With a foothold in being, excendence is a\n\u201cdeparture from being and from the categories which describe\nit.\u201d This ethical excendence designates the site\u2014rather the non-\nsite\u2014of metaphysics as metatheology, metaontology, metaphe-\nnomenology. We will have to return to this reading of the epekeina\ntes ousias and its relationship to ontology. Since we are speaking of\nlight, let us note for the moment that the Platonic movement is\ninterpreted such that it leads no longer to the sun but even beyond\nlight and Being, beyond the light of Being. \u201cWe thus encounter in\nour own way the Platonic idea of the Good beyond Being,\u201d we read at\nthe end of Totality and In\ufb01nity (p. 293\u2013my italics), concerning cre-\nation and fecundity.

Creation is but creation of\nthe other; it can be only as paternity, and the relations of the father\nto son escape all the logical, ontological, and phenomenological\ncategories in which the absoluteness of the other is necessarily the\nsame. (But did not the Platonic sun already enlighten the visible\nsun, and did not excendence play upon the meta-phor of these\ntwo suns? Was not the Good the necessarily nocturnal source of all\nlight? The light of light beyond light. The heart of light is black, as\nhas often been noticed.13 Further, Plato\u2019s sun does not only\nenlighten: it engenders. The good is the father of the visible\nsun which provides living beings with \u201ccreation, growth and\nnourishment\u201d Republic, 508a\u2014509b.)\n(d) Finally, Levinas is certainly quite attentive to everything in Hus-\nserl\u2019s analyses which tempers or complicates the primordiality of\ntheoretical consciousness. In a paragraph devoted to nontheoretical\nconsciousness, it is acknowledged that the primacy of objectivity in\ngeneral is not necessarily confused, in Ideas I, with the primacy of\nthe theoretical attitude.

According to Hegel, on the contrary, this gesture of\ntransgression and assimilation is necessary and essential. Levinas sees in\nit a premetaphysical, natural necessity, and in several splendid analyses\nseparates desire from enjoyment\u2014which Hegel does not appear to do.\nEnjoyment is only deferred in work:22 thus, Hegelian desire would be\nonly need, in Levinas\u2019s sense. But one rightly suspects that things\nwould appear more complicated, if one followed closely the movement\nof certitude and the truth of desire in the Phenomenology of the Mind.\nDespite his anti-Kierkegaardian protests, Levinas here returns to the\nthemes of Fear and Trembling: the movement of desire can be what it is\nonly paradoxically, as the renunciation of desire.\nNeither theoretical intentionality nor the a\ufb00ectivity of need exhaust\nthe movement of desire: they have as their meaning and end their own\naccomplishment, their own ful\ufb01llment and satisfaction within the\ntotality and identity of the same. Desire, on the contrary, permits itself\nto be appealed to by the absolutely irreducible exteriority of the other\nto which it must remain in\ufb01nitely inadequate. Desire is equal only to\nexcess. No totality will ever encompass it. Thus, the metaphysics of\ndesire is a metaphysics of in\ufb01nite separation.

Here there is no\nreturn. For desire is not unhappy. It is opening and freedom.

This is a situation he must share with all anti-\nHegelian thinkers, and whose \ufb01nal signi\ufb01cance calls for much thought.\nHere, in particular, on the relations between desire and the eye,\nbetween sound and theory, the convergence is as profound as the\ndi\ufb00erence, being neither simply added to nor juxtaposed with it. In\ne\ufb00ect, like Levinas Hegel thought that the eye, not aiming at \u201ccon-\nsumption,\u201d suspends desire. It is the very limit of desire (and perhaps,\nthereby, its resource) and is the \ufb01rst theoretical sense. We must not\nconceive light and the eye\u2019s opening on the basis of any physiology,\nbut on the basis of the relation between death and desire. After having\nspoken of taste, touch, and smell, Hegel again writes, in the Aesthetics:\n\u201cSight, on the other hand, possesses a purely ideal relation to objects by\nmeans of light, a material which is at the same time immaterial, and\nwhich su\ufb00ers on its part the objects to continue in their free self-\nsubsistence, making them appear and reappear, but which does not, as\nthe atmosphere or \ufb01re does, consume them actively either by imper-\nceptible degrees or patently. Everything, then is an object of the\nappetiteless vision, [la vue exempte de d\u00e9sirs] which, however, in so far\nas it remains unimpaired in its integrity, merely is disclosed in its form\nand colour.\u201d29\nThis neutralization of desire is what makes sight excellent for Hegel.\nBut for Levinas, this neutralization is also, and for the same reasons, the\n\ufb01rst violence, even though the face is not what it is when the glance is\nabsent. Violence, then, would be the solitude of a mute glance, of a face\nwithout speech, the abstraction of seeing. According to Levinas the glance\nby itself, contrary to what one may be led to believe, does not respect the\nother.

Hearing is concerned with the tone, rather than\nthe form and colour of an object, with the vibration of what is corpor-\neal; it requires no process of dissolution, as the sense of smell requires,\nbut merely a trembling of the object, by which the same is in no wise\nimpoverished. This ideal motion, in which through its sound what is\nas it were the simple individuality [subjectivit\u00e9] the soul of the material\nthing expresses itself, the ear receives also in an ideal way, just as the\neye shape and colour, and su\ufb00ers thereby what is ideal or not external\nin the object to appeal to what is spiritual or non-corporeal.\u201d30 But:\nHearing, which, as also the sight, does not belong to the senses of\naction [sens pratiques] but those of contemplation [sens th\u00e9oriques]; and\nis, in fact, still more ideal than sight.
