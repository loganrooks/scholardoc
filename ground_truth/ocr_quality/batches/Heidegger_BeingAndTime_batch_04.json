We \nhave thus indicated the interconnection by which the structure of an \ninvolvement leads to Dasein's very Being as the sole authentic \"for-the\u00ad\nsake-of-which\" ; for the present, however, we shall pursue this no further. \n'Letting something be involved' must first be clarified enough to give the \nphenomenon ofworldhood the kind of definiteness which makes it possible \nto formulate any problems about it. \nOntically, \"letting something be involved\" signifies that within our \nfactical concern we let something ready-to-hand be so-and-so as it is \nalready and in order that it be such.1 The way we take this ontical sense of \n'letting be' is, in principle, ontological. And therewith we Interpret the \n85 \nmeaning of previously freeing what is proximally ready-to-hand within\u00ad\nthe-world. Previously letting something 'be' does not mean that we must \nfirst bring it into its Being and produce it; it means rather that something \nwhich is already an 'entity' must be discovered in its readiness-to-hand, \nand that we must thus let the entity which has this Being be encountered. \nThis 'a priori' letting-something-be-involved is the condition for the \npossibility of encountering anything ready-to-hand, so that Dasein, in its \nontical dealings with the entity thus encountered, can thereby let it be \ninvolved in the on tical sense. 2 On the other hand, if letting something \nbe involved is understood ontologically, what is then pertinent is the \nfreeing of everything ready-to-hand as ready-to-hand, no matter whether, \ntaken ontically, it is involved thereby, or whether it is rather an entity of \nprecisely such a sort that ontically it is not involved thereby. Such entities \nare, proximally and for the most part, those with which we concern \nourselves when we do not let them 'be' as we have discovered that they \nare, but work upon them, make improvements in them, or smash them \nto pieces. \nWhen we speak of having already let something be involved, so that it \nhas been freed for that involvement, we are using a perfect tense a priori \nwhich characterizes the kind of Being belonging to Dasein itself. 3 Letting \nan entity be involved, if we understand this ontologically, consists in \npreviously freeing it for [auf] its readiness-to-hand within the environment. \nWhen we let something be involved, it must be involved in something; \nand in terms of this \"in-which\", the \"with-which\" of this involvement \n1 'Bewendenlasen bedeutet ontisch; innerhalb eines faktischen Besorgens ein Zuhan\u00ad\ndenes so und so sein lassen, wie es nunmehr ist und damit es so ist.' \n2 ' \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n es im ontischen Sinne dabei bewenden lassen kann.'

It holds itself in them with familiarity ; and in so \ndoing, it holds them before itself, for it is in these that its assignment \noperates.1 The understanding lets itself make assignments both i n  these \nrelationships themselves and o f them. 2 The relational character which \nthese relationships of assigning possess, we take as one of signifying. 3 In \nits familiarity with these relationships, Dasein 'signifies' to itself: in a prim\u00ad\nordial manner it gives itself both its Being and its potentiality-for-Being \nas something which it is to understand with regard to its Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld. The \"for-the-sake-of-which\" signifies an \"in-order-to\" ; this in \nturn, a \"towards-this\" ;  the latter, an \"in-which\" of letting something be \ninvolved ; and that in turn, the \"with-which\" of an involvement. These \nrelationships are bound up with one another as a primordial totality; \nthey are what they are a s this signifying [Be-deuten) in which Dasein \ngives itself beforehand its Being-in-the-world as something to be under\u00ad\nstood. The relational totality of this signifying we call \"significance\". This \nis what makes up the structure of the world-the structure of that wherein \nDasein as such already is. Dasein, in its familiarity with significance, is the \nontical condition for the possibility of discovering entities which are encountered in a \nworld with involvement (readiness-to-hand) as their kind of Being, and which can \nthus make themselves known as they are in themselves [in seinem An-sich]. Dasein \nas such is always something of this sort; along with its Being, a context of \nthe ready-to-hand is already essentially discovered : Dasein, in so far as it \n1 'Das . . .  Verstehen . . .  halt die angezeigten Bezlige in einer vorgangigen Erschlossen\u00ad\nheit. Im vertrauten Sich-darin-halten halt es sich diese vor als das, worin sich sein Ver\u00ad\nweisen bewegt.' The context suggests that Heidegger's 'diese' refers to the relationships \n(Bezlige) rather than to the disclosedness (Erschlossenheit), though the latter interpreta\u00ad\ntion seems a bit more plausible grammatically. \n2 'Das Verstehen llisst sich in und von diesen Bezligen selbst verweisen.' It is not \nentirely clear whether 'von' should be translated as 'of', 'from', or 'by'. \n3 'he-deuten'. While Heidegger ordinarily writes this word without a hyphen (even, for \ninstance, in the next sentence), he here takes pains to hyphenate it so as to suggest that \netymologically it consists of the intensive prefix 'be-' followed by the verb 'deuten'-to \n'interpret', 'explain' or 'point to' something. We shall continue to follow our convention \nof usually translating 'bedeuten' and 'Bedeutung' by 'signify' and 'signification' respec\u00ad\ntively, reserving 'significance' for 'Bedeutsamkeit' (or, in a few cases, for 'Bedeutung'). \nBut these translations obscure the underlying meanings which Heidegger is emphasizing \nin this pasage. \n"

And inasmuch as Relations are always 'something thought', \nhas not the Being of entities within-the-world been dissolved into 'pure \n88 \nthinking' ? \nWithin our present field of investigation the following structures and \ndimensions of ontological problematics, as we have repeatedly empha\u00ad\nsized, must be kept in principle distinct : 1. the Being of those entities \nwithin-the-world which we proximally encounter-readiness-to-hand; \n2. the Being of those entities which we can come across and whose nature \nwe can determine if we discover them in their own right by going through \nthe entities proximally encountered-presence-at-hand; 3\u00b7 the Being of \nthat on tical condition which makes it possible for entities within-the-world \nto be discovered at all-the worldhood of the world. This third kind of \nBeing gives us an existential way of determining the nature of Being-in-the\u00ad\nworld, that is, of Dasein. The other two concepts of Being are categories, \nand pertain to entities whose Being is not of the kind which Dasein pos\u00ad\nsesses. The context of assignments or references, which, as significance, 'is \nconstitutive for worldhood, can be taken formally in the sense of a system \nof Relations. But one must note that in such formalizations the pheno\u00ad\nmena get levelled off so much that their real phenomenal content may be \nlost, especially in the case of such 'simple' relationships as those which lurk \nin significance. The phenomenal content of these 'Relations' and 'Relata' \n1 'angewiesen' ; 'Angewiesenheit'. The verb 'anweisen', like 'verweisen', can often be \ntranslated as 'assign', particularly in the sense in which one assigns or allots a place to \nsomething, or in the sense in which one gives an 'assignment' to someone by instructing \nhim how to proceed. The past participle 'angewiesen' can thus mean 'assigned' in either \nof these senses; but it often takes on the connotation of'being dependent on' something or \neven 'at the mercy' of something. In this passage we have tried to compromise by using \nthe verb 'submit'. Other passages call for other idioms, and no single standard translation \nseems feasible. \n"

What kind of understanding of Being does \nhe have when he defines the Being of these entities ? The term for the \nBeing of an entity that is in itself, is \"substantia\".

Foundations of the Ontological Definition of the ' World' \nSubstantiality is the idea of Being to which the ontological characteriza\u00ad\ntion of the res extensa harks back. \"Per substantiam nihil aliud intelligere \npossumus, quam rem quae ita existit, ut nulla alia re indigeat ad existendum.\" \"By \nsubstance we can understand nothing else than an entity which is in such \na way that it needs no other entity in order to be. \"x The Being of a 'sub\u00ad\nstance' is characterized by not needing anything. That whose Being is \nsuch that it has no need at all for any other entity satisfies the idea of \nsubstance in the authentic sense; this entity is the ens perfectissimum. \n\" . . .  substantia quae nulla plane re indigeat, unica tantum potest intelligi, nempe \nDeus.\"xi Here 'God' is a purely ontological term, if it is to be understood \nas ens perfectissimum. At the same time, the 'self-evident' connotation of \nthe concept of God is such as to permit an ontological interpretation for \nthe characteristic of not needing anything-a constitutive item in sub\u00b7 \nstantiality. \"Alias vero omnes (res ), non nisi ope concursus Dei existere posse \npercipimus.\"xii All entities other than God need to be \"produced\" in the \nwidest sense and also to be sustained. 'Being' is to be understood within \na horizon which ranges from the production of what is to be present-at\u00b7 \nhand to something which has no need of being produced. Every entity \nwhich is not God is an ens creatum. The Being which belongs to one of these \nentities is 'infinitely' different from that which belongs to the other; yet \nwe still consider creation and creator alike as entities. We are thus using \n\"Being\" in so wide a sense that its meaning embraces an 'infinite' differ\u00b7 \nence. So even created entities can be called \"substance\" with some right. \nRelative to God, of course, these entities need to be produced and sus\u00b7 \ntained ; but within the realm of created entities-the 'world' in the sense \nof ens creatum-there are things which 'are in need of no other entity' \n"

But \" . . .  nomen substantiae non con\u00ad\nvenit Deo et illis univoce ut dici solet in Scholis, hoc est . . .  quae Deo et creaturis \nsit communis.\"xiU Here Descartes touches upon a problem with which \nmedieval ontology was often busied-the question of how the signification \nof \"Being\" signifies any entity which one may on occasion be con\u00ad\nsidering. In the assertions 'God is' and 'the world is', we assert Being. \nThis word 'is', however, cannot be meant to apply to these entities in the \nsame sense (uvvwvvp.ws, univoce) , when between them there is an infinite \ndifference of Being; if the signification of 'is' were univocal, then what is \ncreated would be viewed as if it were uncreated, or the uncreated would \nbe reduced to the status of something created. But neither. does 'Being' \nfunction as a mere name which is the same in both cases : in both cases \n'Being' is understood. This positive sense in which 'Being' signifies is one \nwhich the Schoolmen took as a signification 'by analogy', as distinguished \nfrom one which is univocal or merely homonymous. Taking their depar\u00ad\nture from Aristotle, in whom this problem is foreshadowed in prototypical \nform just as at the very outset of Greek ontology, they established various \nkinds of analogy, so that even the 'Schools' have different ways of taking \nthe signification-function of \"Being\". In working out this problem onto\u00ad\nlogically, Descartes is always far behind the Schoolmen ;xiv indeed he \nevades the question. \" . . .  nulla eius (substantiae ) nominis significatio potest \ndistincte intelligi, quae Deo et creaturis sit communis.\"xv This evasion is tanta\u00ad\nmount to his failing to discuss the meaning of Being which the idea of \nsubstantiality embraces, or the character of the 'universality' which belongs \nto this signification. Of course even the ontology of the medievals has gone \nno further than that of the ancients in inquiring into what \"Being\" itself \nmay mean. So it is not surprising if no headway is made with a question \nlike that of the way in which \"Being\" signifies, as long as this has to be \ndiscussed on the basis of an unclarified meaning of Being which this \nsignification 'expresses'. The meaning remains unclarified because it is \nheld to be 'self-evident'. \n94 \nDescartes not only evades the ontological question of substantiality \naltogether; he also emphasizes explicitly that substance as such-that is \nto say, its substantiality-is in and for itself inaccessible from the outset \n[ vorgangig] .

'Being is not a \nReal predicate,' says Kant, 1 who is merely repeating Descartes' principle. \nThus the possibility of a pure problematic of Being gets renounced in \nprinciple, and a way is sought for arriving at those definite characteristics \nof substance which we have designated above. Because 'Being' is not in \nfact accessible as an entity, it is expressed through attributes-definite \ncharacteristics of the entities under comideration, characteristics which \nthemselves are.2 Being is not expressed through just any such charac\u00ad\nteristics, but rather through those satisfying in the purest manner that \nmeaning of \"Being\" and \"substantiality\", which has still been tacitly \npresupposed. To the substantia finita as res corporea, what must primarily \nbe 'assigned' [\"Zuweisung\"] is the extensio. \"Quin et facilius intelligimus \nsubstantiam extensam, vel substantiam cogitantem, quam substantiam solam, \nomisso eo quod cogitet vel sit extensa\" ;xvu for substantiality is detachable \nratione tantum; it is not detachable realiter, nor can we come across it in \nthe way in which we come across those entities themselves which a r e  \nsubstantially. \nThus the ontological grounds for defining the 'world' as res extensa have \nbeen made plain: they lie in the idea of substantiality, which not only \nremains unclarified in the meaning of its Being, but gets passed off as \nsomething incapable of clarification, and gets represented indirectly by \nway of whatever substantial property belongs most pre-eminently to the \nparticular substance. Moreover, in this way of defining a substance \nthrough some substantial entity, lies the reason why the term \"substance\" \nis used in two ways. What is here intended is substantiality; and it getc; \nunderstood in terms of a characteristic of substance-a characteristic \nwhich is itself an entity.3 Because something ontical is made to underlie \nthe ontological, the expression \"substantia\" functions sometimes with a \nsignification which is ontological, sometimes with one which is ontical, but \nmostly with one which is hazily ontico-ontological. Behind this slight \ndifference of signification, however, there lies hidden a failure to master \nthe basic problem of Being. To treat this adequately, we must 'track \ndown' the equivocations in the right way. He who attempts this sort of \nthing does not just 'busy himself' with 'merely verbal significations' ; he \nmust venture forward into the most primordial problematic of the 'things \n95 \nthemselves' to get such 'nuances' straightened out. \n1 Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure &ason, Transcendental Dialectic, Bok II, chapter III, \nSection 4\u00b7 \nB ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n seiende Bestimmtheiten des betreffenden Seienden . .  .' \na ' . . .  a us einer seienden Beschaffenheit der Substanz.' \n"

Section 1 9) .  \nHardness gets taken as resistance. But neither hardness nor resistance \nis understood in a phenomenal sense, as something experienced in itself \nwhose nature can be determined in such an experience. For Descartes, \nresistance amounts to no more than not yielding place-that is, not \nundergoing any change of location. So if a Thing resists, this means that \nit stays in a definite location relatively to some other Thing which is \nchanging its location, or that it is changing its own location with a velocity \nwhich permits the other Thing to 'catch up' with it. But when the exper\u00ad\nience of hardness is Interpreted this way, the kind of Being which belongs \nto sensory perception is obliterated, and so is any possibility that the \nentities encountered in such perception should be grasped in their Being. \nDescartes takes the kind of Being which belongs to the perception of \nsomething, and translates it into the only kind he knows : the perception \nof something becomes a definite way of Being-present-at-hand-side-by\u00ad\nside of two res extensae which are present-at-hand ; the way in which their \nmovements are related is itself a mode of that extensio by which the \npresence-at-hand of the corporeal Thing is primarily characterized. Of \ncourse no behaviour in which one feels one's way by touch [ eines tastenden \nVerhaltens] can be 'completed' unless what can thus be felt [des Betast\u00ad\nbaren] has 'closeness' of a very special kind. But this does not mean that \ntouching [Beriihrung] and the hardness which makes itself known in \ntouching consist ontologically in different velocities of two corporeal \nThings. Hardness and resistance do not show themselves at all unless an \nentity has the kind of Being which Dasein--or at least something living\u00ad\npossesses. \nThus Descartes' discussion of possible kinds of access to entities within\u00ad\nthe-world is dominated by an idea of Being which has been gathered from \na definite realm of these entities themselves. \ng8 \nThe idea of Being as permanent presence-at-hand not only gives \nDescartes a motive for identifying entities within-the-world with the world \nin general, and for providing so extreme a definition of their Being; it \nalso keeps him from bringing Dasein's ways of behaving into view in a \nmanner which is ontologically appropriate.

If Descartes does not know the phenomenon of \nthe world, and thus knows no such thing as within-the-world-ness, how \ncan he identify the world itself with certain entities within-the-world and \nthe Being which they possess ? \nIn controversy over principles, one must not only attach oneself to \ntheses which can be grasped doxographically ; one must also derive one's \norientation from the objective tendency of the problematic, even if it \ndoes not go beyond a rather ordinary way of taking things. In his doctrine \nof the res cogitans and the res extensa, Descartes not only wants to formulate \nthe problem of 'the \"I\" and the world' ; he claims to have solved it in a \nradical manner. His Meditations make this plain. (Sec especially Medita\u00ad\ntions I and VI.) By taking his basicontological orientation from traditional \nsources and not subjecting it to positive criticism, he has made it impos\u00ad\nsible to lay bare any primordial ontological problematic of Dasein ; this \nhas inevitably obstructed his view of the phenomenon of the world, and \nhas made it possible for the ontology of the 'world' to be compressed into \nthat of certain entities within-the-world. The foregoing discussion should \nhave proved this. \nOne might retort, however, that even if in point offact both the problem \nof the world and the Being of the entities encountered environmentally \nas closest to us remain concealed, Descartes has still laid the basis for \ncharacterizing ontologically that entity within-the-world upon which, in \nits very Being, every other entity is founded-material Nature. This would \nbe the fundamental stratum upon which all the other strata of actuality \nwithin-the-world are built up.

When equipment for something or other has its place, \nthis place defines itself as the place of this equipment-as one place out \nof a whole totality of places directionally lined up with each other and \nbelonging to the context of equipment that is environmentally ready-to\u00ad\nhand. Such a place and such a muliplicity of places are not to be inter\u00ad\npreted as the \"where\" of some random Being-present-at-hand of Things. \nIn each case the place is the definite 'there' or 'yonder' [\"Dart\" und \n\"Da\"] of an item of equipment which belongs somewhere. Its belonging\u00ad\nsomewhere at the time [Die jeweilige Hingehorigheit] corresponds to the \n103 \nequipmental character of what is ready-to-hand ; that is, it corresponds to \nthe belonging-to [Zugehorigkeit] which the ready-to-hand has towards a \ntotality of equipment in accordance with its involvements. But in general \nthe \"whither\" to which the totality of places for a context of equipment \ngets allotted, is the underlying condition which makes possible the belong\u00ad\ning-somewhere of an equipmental totality as something that can be placed, \nThis \"whither\", which makes it possible for equipment to belong some\u00ad\nwhere, and which we circumspectively keep in view ahead of us in our \nconcernful dealings, we call the \"region\" .1 \n'In the region of' means not only 'in the direction of' but also within \nthe range [Umkreis] of something that lies in that direction. The kind of \nplace which is constituted by direction and remoteness2 (and closeness \nis only a mode of the latter) is already oriented towards a region and \noriented within it. Something like a region must first be discovered if \nthere is to be any possibility of allotting or coming across places for a \ntotality of equipment that is circumspectively at one's disposal. The \nregional orientation of the multiplicity of places belonging to the ready\u00ad\nto-hand goes to make up the aroundness-the \"round-about-us\" [das \nUm-uns-herum]--of those entities which we encounter as closest environ\u00ad\nmentally. A three-dimensional multiplicity of possible positions which \ngets filled up with Things present-at-hand is never proximally given.

This \nsentence too is ambiguous. The pronoun 'Sie' may refer either to the region, as we have \nsuggested, or to its readiness-to-hand. Furthermore, while we have taken 'nur sichtbar in \nder Weise des Auffallens' as a unit, it is possible that 'in der Weise des Auffallens' \nshould be construed as going with the words that follow.

The nouns 'Entfernung' and 'Entfernheit' can usually be \ntranslated by 'removing', 'removal', 'remoteness', or even 'distance'. In this passage, \nhowever, Heidegger is calling attention to the fact that these words are derived from the \nstem 'fern-' {'far' or 'distant') and the privative prefix 'ent-'. Usually this prefix would be \nconstrued as merely intensifying the notion of separation or distance expressed in the \n'fern-'; but Heidegger chooses to construe it as more strictly privative, so that the verb \n'entfernen' will be taken to mean abolishing a distance or farness rather than enhancing it. \nIt is as if by the very act of recognizing the 'remoteness' of something, we have in a sense \nbrought it closer and made it less 'remote'. \nApparently there is no word in English with an etymological structure quite parallel \n"

De-severance discovers remoteness; and \nremoteness, like distance, is a determinate categorial characteristic of \nentities whose nature is not that of Dasein. De-severance*, however, is \nan existentiale; this must be kept in mind. Only to the extent that entities \nare revealed for Dasein in their deseveredness [Entferntheit], do 'remote\u00ad\nnesses' [\"Entfernungen\"] and distances with regard to other things \nbecome accessible in entities within-the-world themselves. Two points are \njust as little desevered from one another as two Things, for neither of these \ntypes of entity has the kind of Being which would make it capable of \ndesevering. They merely have a measurable distance between them, \nwhich we can come across in our de-severing. \nProximally and for the most part, de-severing3 is a circumspective \nto that of 'entfernen' ; perhaps 'dissever' comes the nearest, for this too is a verb of separa\u00ad\ntion in which a privative prefix is used as an intensive. We have coined the similar verb \n'desever' in the hope that this will suggest Heidegger's meaning when 'remove' and its \nderivatives seem inappropriate. But with 'desever', one cannot slip back and forth from \none sense to another as easily as one can with 'entfernen'; so we have resorted to the \nexpedient of using both 'desever' and 'remove' and their derivatives, depending upon the \nsense we feel is intended. Thus 'entfernen' will generally be rendered by 'remove' or \n'desever', 'entfernt' by 'remote' or 'desevered'. Since Heidegger is careful to distinguish \n'Entfernung' and 'Entferntheit', we shall usually translate these by 'deseverance' and \n'remoteness' respectively; in the few cases where these translations do not seem appro\u00ad\npriate, we shall subjoin the German word in brackets. \nOur problem is further complicated by Heidegger's practise of occasionally putting a \nhyphen after the prefix 'ent-', presumably to emphasize its privative character. In such \ncases we shall write 'de-sever', 'de-severance', etc. Unfortunately, however, there are \ntypographical discrepancies between the earlier and later editions. Som\u0230 of the earlier \nhyphens occur at the ends of lines and have been either intentionally or inadvertently \nomitted in resetting the type; some appear at the end of the line in the later editions, but \nnot in the earlier ones; others have this position in both editions. We shall indicate each \nof these ambiguous cases with an asterisk, supplying a hyphen only if there seems to be a \ngood reason for doing so. \nOn 'Ausrichtung' see our note 2, p. 135, H. 102 above. \n1 'Abstand'. Heidegger uses three words which might be translated as 'distance' : \n'Ferne' (our 'farness'), 'Entfernung' (our 'deseverance'), and 'Abstand' ('distance' in the \nsense of a measurable interval). We shall reserve 'distance' for 'Abstand'. \n2 'Entfernen* besagt ein Verschwindenmachen der Ferne, d. h. der Entferntheit von \netwas, Naherung.' \ns This hyphen is found only in the later editions, \n"

The Objective distances of Things \npresent-at-hand do not coincide with the remoteness and closeness of \nwhat is ready-to-hand within-the-world. Though we may know these \ndistances exactly, this knowledge still remains blind ; it does not have the \nfunction of discovering the environment circumspectively and bringing it \nclose ; this knowledge is used only in and for a concernful Being which \ndoes not measure stretches-a Being towards the world that 'matters' to \none [ .\n.\n\u2022\n Sein zu der einen \"angehenden\" Welt]. \nWhen one is oriented beforehand towards 'Nature' and 'Objectively' \nmeasured distances of Things, one is inclined to pass off such estimates \nand interpretations of deseverance as 'subjective'. Yet this 'subjectivity' \nperhaps uncovers the 'Reality' of the world at its most Real ; it has nothing \nto do with 'subjective' arbitrariness or subjectivistic 'ways of taking' an \nentity which 'in itself' is otherwise. The circumspective de-severing of Dasein' s \neverydayness reveals the Being-in-itself of the 'true world'-of that entity which \nDasein, as something existing, is already alongside. 2 \nWhen one is primarily and even exclusively oriented towards remote-\nnesses as measured distances, the primordial spatiality of Being-in is \nconcealed. That which is presumably 'closest' is by no means that which \nI07 \nis at the smallest distance 'from us'. It lies in that which is desevered to an \naverage extent when we reach for it, grasp it, or look at it. Because Dasein \nis essentially spatial in the way of de-severance, its dealings always keep \nwithin an 'environment' which is desevered from it with a certain leeway \n[Spielraum] ; accordingly our seeing and hearing always go proximally \nbeyond what is distantially 'closest'. Seeing and hearing are distance-\nsenses [Fernsinne] not because they are far-reaching, but because it is in \nthem that Dasein as deseverant mainly dwells. When, for instance, a man \nwears a pair of spectacles which are so close to him distantially that they \nare 'sitting on his nose', they are environmentally more remote from hiin \nthan the picture on the opposite wall. Such equipment has so little \ncloseness that often it is proximally quite impossible to find. Equipment \nfor seeing-and likewise for hearing, such as the telephone receiver-has \nwhat we have designated as the inconspicuousness of the proximally ready\u00ad\nto-hand. So too, for instance, does the street, as equipment for walking. \nOne feels the touch of it at every step as one walks ; it is seemingly the \n\u00b7 closest and Realest of all that is ready-to-hand, and it slides itself, as it \n1 'vorkommt' ; ' \"Vorkommen\" '. In general 'vorkommen' may be translated as \n'occur', and is to be thought of as applicable strictly to the present-at-hand. In this \npasage, however, it is applied to the ready-to-hand; and a translation which calls \nattention to its etymological structure seeilll to be called for. \nII 'Das wnsichtige Ent-fernen tkr Alltiiglichkeit rks Daseins enttkckt das An-sich-sein tkr \"wahrm \nWelt\", des Seientkn, bei dem Dasein als existief'mtks je schon ist.' \n"

Circumspective concern decides as to the closeness \nand farness of what is proximally ready-to-hand environmentally. What\u00ad\never this concern dwells alongside beforehand is what is closest, and this \nis what regulates our de-severances. \nIfDasein, in its concern, brings something close by, this does not signify \nthat it fixes something at a spatial position with a minimal distance from \nsome point of the body. When something is close by, this means that it is \nwithin the range of what is proximally ready-to-hand for circumspection. \nBringing-close is not oriented towards the I-Thing encumbered with a \nbody, but towards concernful Being-in-the-world-that is, towards what\u00ad\never is proximally encountered in such Being. It follows, moreover, that \nDasein's spatiality is not to be defined by citing the position at which \nsome corporeal Thing is present-at-hand. Of course we say that even \nDasein always occupies a place. But this 'occupying' must be distinguished \nin principle from Being-ready-to-hand at a place in some particular \nregion. Occupying a place must be conceived as a desevering of the \nenvironmentally ready-to-hand into a region which has been circumspec\u00ad\ntively discovered in advance.

Dasein, \nin accordance with its spatiality, is proximally never here but yonder; \nfrom this \"yonder\" it comes back to its \"here\" ; and it comes back to its \n108 \n\"here\" only in the way in which it interprets its concernful Being\u00ad\ntowards in terms of what is ready-to-hand yonder.

This de-severance-the farness of the ready-to-hand from Dasein \nitself-is something that Dasein can never cross over. Of course the remote\u00ad\nness of something ready-to-hand from Dasein can show up as a distance \nfrom it, 1 if this remoteness is determined by a relation to some Thing \nwhich gets thought of as present-at-hand at the place Dasein has formerly \noccupied. Dasein can subsequently traverse the \"between\" of this distance, \nbut only in such a way that the distance itself becomes one which has been \ndesevered *. So little has Dasein crossed over its de-severance that \nit has rather taken it along with it and keeps doing so constantly ; for \n1 ' \u2022 \u2022 .  kann zwar selbst von diesem als Abstand vorfindlich werden . .  .' \n"

But what does this \nsignify except that whenever this happens I necessarily orient myself both \ni n  and from my being already alongside a world which is 'familiar' ?1 The \nequipment-context of a world must have been presented to Dasein. That \nI am already in a world is no less constitutive for the possibility of orienta\u00ad\ntion than is the feeling for right and left. While this state of Dasein's \nBeing is an obvious one, we are not thereby justified in suppressing the \nontologically constitutive role which it plays. Even Kant does not suppress \nit, any more than any other Interpretation of Dasein. Yet the fact that \nthis is a state of which we constantly make use, does not exempt us from \nproviding a suitable ontological explication, but rather demands one. \nThe psychological Interpretation according to which the \"I\" has some\u00ad\nthing 'in the memory' [\"im Gedachtnis\"] is at bottom a way of alluding to \nthe existentially constitutive stateofBeing-in-the-world.

This discovery, which is founded upon the worldhood of the world, \nis one which we have characterized as freeing entities for a totality of \ninvolvements. Freeing something and letting it be involved, is accom\u00ad\nplished by way of referring or assigning oneself circumspectively, and this \nin turn is based upon one's previously understanding significance. We \nhave now shown that circumspective Being-in-the-world is spatial. And \nonly because Dasein is spatial in the way of de-severanc\u01f4 and directionality \ncan what is ready-to-hand within-the-world be encountered in its spat\u00ad\niality. To free a totality of involvements is, equiprimordially, to let some\u00ad\nthing be involved at a region, and to do so by de-severing and giving \ndirectionality; this amounts to freeing the spatial belonging-somewhere of \nthe ready-to-hand. In that significance with which Dasein (as concernful \nBeing-in) is familiar, lies the essential co-disclosedness of space.1 \nThe space which is thus disclosed with the worldhood of the world still \nlacks the pure multiplicity of the three dimensions. In this disclosedness \nwhich is closest to us, space, as the pure \"wherein\" in which positions are \nordered by measurement and the situations of things are determined, still \nremains hidden. In the phenomenon of the region we have already indi\u00ad\ncated that on the basis of which space is discovered beforehand in Dasein. \nBy a 'region\" we have understood the \"whither\" to which an equipment\u00ad\ncontext ready-to-hand might possibly belong, when that context is of \nsuch a sort that it can be encountered as directionally desevered-that \nis, as having been placed. 2 This belongingness [Gehorigkeit] is determined \nI I I \nin terms of the significance which is constitutive for the world, and it \nArticulates the \"hither\" and \"thither\" within the possible \"whither\". In \ngeneral the \"whither\" gets prescribed by a referential totality which has \nbeen made fast in a \"for-the-sake-of-which\" of concern, and within which \nletting something be involved by freeing it, assigns itself. With anything \nencountered as ready-to-hand there is always an involvement in [bei] a \nregion. To the totality of involvements which makes up the Being of the \nready-to-hand within-the-world, there belongs a spatial involvement \nwhich has the character of a region.

In \nconcerning itself circumspectively with the world, Dasein can move \nthings around or out of the way or 'make room' for them [urn-, weg-, \nund \"einraumen\"] only because making-room-understood as an exist\u00ad\nentiale-belongs to its Being-in-the-world. But neither the region pre\u00ad\nviously discovered nor in general the current spatiality is explicitly in \nview. In itself it is present [zugegen] for circumspection in the inconspicu\u00ad\nousness of those ready-to-hand things in which that circumspection is \nconcernfully absorbed. With Being-in-the-world, space is proximally \ndiscovered in this spatiality. On the basis of the spatiality thus discovered, \nspace itself becomes accessible for cognition. \nSpace is not in the subject, nor is the world in space. Space is rather 'in' the \nworld in so far as space has been disclosed by that Being-in-the-world \nwhich is constitutive for Dasein. Space is not to be found in the subject, \nnor does the subject observe the world 'as if' that world were in a space ; \nbut the 'subject' (Dasein), if well understood ontologically, is spatial. And \nbecause Dasein is spatial in the way we have described, space shows itself \nas a priori. This term does not mean anything like previously belonging \nto a subject which is proximally still worldless and which emits a space \nout of itself. Here \"apriority\" means the previousness with which space \nhas been encountered (as a region) whenever the ready-to-hand is en\u00ad\ncountered environmentally. \nThe spatiality of what we proximally encounter in circumspection can \nbecome a theme for circumspection itself, as well as a task for calculation \n1 1 2  \nand measurement, as in building and surveying. Such thematization of \nthe spatiality of the environment is still predominantly an act of circum\u00ad\nspection by which space in itself already comes into view in a certain way. \nThe space which thus shows itself can be studied purely by looking at it, \nif one gives up what was formerly the only possibility of access to it\u00ad\ncircumspective calculation. When space is 'intuited formally', the pure \n1 Both 'Raum-geben' (our 'giving space') and 'Einriiumen' (our 'making room') are \noften used in the metaphorical sense of 'yielding', 'granting', or 'making concessions'. \n'Einriiumen' may also be used for 'arranging' furniture, 'moving it in', or 'stowing it \naway'. \n"

In our present study we shall not consider \nhow all these are interconnected.xxii Our problematic is merely designed \nto establish ontologically the phenomenal basis upon which one can \ntake the discovery of pure space as a theme for investigation, and work \nit out. \nWhen space is discovered non-circumspectively by just looking at it, \nthe environmental regions get neutralized to pure dimensions. Places\u00ad\nand indeed the whole circumspectively oriented totality of places belong\u00ad\ning to equipment ready-to-hand-get reduced to a multiplicity of posi\u00ad\ntions for random Things. The spatiality of what is ready-to-hand within\u00ad\nthe-world loses its involvement-character, and so does the ready-to-hand. \nThe world loses its specific aroundness ; the environment becomes the \nworld of Nature. The 'world', as a totality of equipment ready-to-hand, \nbecomes spatialized [verdiumlicht] to a context of extended Things which \nare just present-at-hand and no more. The homogeneous space of Nature \nshows itself only when the entities we encounter are discovered in such \na way that the worldly character of the ready-to-hand gets specifically \ndeprived of its worldhood.1 \nIn accordance with its Being-in-the-world, Dasein always has space \npresented as already discovered, though not thematically. On the other \nhand, space in itself, so far as it embraces the mere possibilities of the pure \nspatial Being of something, remains proximally still concealed. The fact that \nspace essentially shows itself in a world is not yet decisive for the kind of Being \nwhich it possesses. It need not have the kind ofBeing characteristic ofsome-\nthing which is itself spatially ready-to-hand or present-at-hand. Nor does \nthe Being of space have the kind ofBeingwhich belongs to Dasein. Though \nthe Being of space itself cannot be conceived as the kind of Being which \nbelongs to a res extensa, it does not follow that it must be defined onto\u00ad\nlogically as a 'phenomenon' of such a res. (In its Being, it would not be \n1 1 3 \ndistinguished from such a res.) Nor does it follow that the Being of space \ncan be equated to that of the res cogitans and conceived as merely 'subjec-\ntive', quite apart from the questionable character of the Being of such a \nsubject. \nThe Interpretation of the Being of space has hitherto been a matter of \nperplexity, not so much because we have been insufficiently acquainted \nwith the content of space itself as a thing [des Sachgehaltes des Raumes \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 die den Charakter einer spezifischen Entweltlichung der Weltmassigkeit des \nZuhandenen hat.' \n"
