How can such an a\ufb03rmation, made necessary by and in phenom-\nenology itself, be totally certain within phenomenology? For it does\nnot only concern phenomena that are experienced and self-evident.\nDoes its inability to be indicated rigorously anywhere else than in a\nphenomenology prevent it from already\u2014or still\u2014being a meta-\nphysical assertion, the a\ufb03rmation of a metaphysics which articulates\nitself in a phenomenological discourse? I am satis\ufb01ed only to raise\nthese questions here.\nReason, thus, unveils itself. Reason, Husserl says, is the logos which is\nproduced in history. It traverses Being with itself in sight, in sight of\nappearing to itself, that is, to state itself and hear itself as logos. It is\nspeech as auto-a\ufb00ection: hearing oneself speak.25It emerges from itself\nin order to take hold of itself within itself, in the \u201cliving present\u201d of its\nself-presence. In emerging from itself, hearing oneself speak consti-\ntutes itself as the history of reason through the detour of writing. Thus it\ndi\ufb00ers from itself in order to reappropriate itself. The Origin of Geometry describes the\nnecessity of this exposition of reason in a worldly inscription. An\nexposition indispensable to the constitution of truth and the ideality of\nobjects, but which is also the danger to meaning from what is outside\nthe sign. In the moment of writing, the sign can always \u201cempty\u201d itself,\ntake \ufb02ight from awakening, from \u201creactivation,\u201d and may remain for-\never closed and mute. As for Cournot, writing here is the \u201ccritical\nepoch.\u201d\nHere, one must become quite attentive to the fact that this lan-\nguage is not immediately speculative and metaphysical, as certain con-\nsonant phrases of Hegel\u2019s seemed to be for Husserl, correctly or\nincorrectly. For this logos which calls to itself and summons itself by\nitself as telos, and whose dynamis tends toward its energeia or entelechia\u2014\nthis logos does not occur in history and does not traverse Being as a\nwriting and difference\n208\n"

Despite\nall these classical notions, phenomenology does not abdicate itself for\nthe bene\ufb01t of a classical metaphysical speculation which on the con-\ntrary, according to Husserl, would have to recognize in phenomen-\nology the clari\ufb01ed energy of its own intentions. Which amounts to\nsaying that in criticizing classical metaphysics, phenomenology\naccomplishes the most profound project of metaphysics. Husserl\nacknowledges or rather claims this himself, particularly in the Cartesian\nMeditations. The results of phenomenology are \u201cmetaphysical, if it be\ntrue that ultimate cognitions of being should be called metaphysical.\nOn the other hand, what we have here is anything but metaphysics, in the\ncustomary sense with which metaphysics, as \u2018\ufb01rst philosophy,\u2019 was\ninstituted originally.\u201d26 \u201cPhenomenology indeed excludes every na\u00efve\nmetaphysics. . . but does not exclude metaphysics as such.\u201d27 For within the\nmost universal eidos of mental historicity, the conversion of phil-\nosophy into phenomenology would be the \ufb01nal degree of di\ufb00eren-\ntiation (stage, that is, Stufe, structural level or genetic stage).28 The\ntwo previous degrees would be, \ufb01rst, that of a pretheoretical culture,\nand next, that of the theoretical or philosophical project (the Greco-\nEuropean moment).29\nThe presence of Telos or Vorhaben\u2014the in\ufb01nite theoretical anticipation\nwhich simultaneously is given as an in\ufb01nite practical task\u2014for phe-\nnomenological consciousness is indicated every time that Husserl\nspeaks of the Idea in the Kantian sense. The latter is o\ufb00ered within phenom-\nenological self-evidence as evidence of an essential over\ufb02owing of\nactual and adequate self-evidence.

That is to\nsay, a case. A work or an adventure of thought is made to bear witness,\nas example or martyr, to a structure whose essential permanence\nbecomes the prime preoccupation of the commentary. For criticism to\nmake a case of meaning or of value, to take them seriously, is to read an\nessence into the example which is falling between the phenomeno-\nlogical brackets.

And later, proposing the withdrawal of the theater\nfrom text, prompter [sou\ufb04eur], and the omnipotence of a primary\nlogos, Artaud will not simply wish to give it over to mutism.

Whatever may be thought of the continuities and\nruptures to come, this hypothesis is remarkable as soon as it is con-\nsidered as a metaphorical model and not as a neurological description.\nBreaching, the tracing of a trail, opens up a conducting path. Which\npresupposes a certain violence and a certain resistance to e\ufb00raction.\nThe path is broken, cracked, fracta, breached. Now there would be two\nkinds of neurones: the permeable neurones (\u0001), which o\ufb00er no resist-\nance and thus retain no trace of impression, would be the perceptual\nneurones; other neurones (\u03c8), which would oppose contact-barriers\nto the quantity of excitation, would thus retain the printed trace: they\n\u201cthus a\ufb00ord a possibility of representing (darzustellen) memory\u201d (ibid.).\nThis is the \ufb01rst representation, the \ufb01rst staging of memory. (Darstellung is\nrepresentation in the weak sense of the word, but also frequently in the\nsense of visual depiction, and sometimes of theatrical performance.\nOur translation will vary with the in\ufb02ection of the context.) Freud\nattributes psychical quality only to these latter neurones. They are the\n\u201cvehicles of memory and so probably of psychical processes in gen-\neral\u201d (I, 300). Memory, thus, is not a psychical property among others;\nit is the very essence of the psyche: resistance, and precisely, thereby,\nan opening to the e\ufb00raction of the trace.\nNow assuming that Freud here intends to speak only the language of\nfull and present quantity, assuming, as at least appears to be the case,\nthat he intends to situate his work within the simple opposition of\nquantity and quality (the latter being reserved for the pure transpar-\nency of a perception without memory), we \ufb01nd that the concept of\nbreaching shows itself intolerant of this intention. An equality of\nresistance to breaching, or an equivalence of the breaching forces,\nwould eliminate any preference in the choice of itinerary. Memory would\nbe paralyzed. It is the di\ufb00erence between breaches which is the true\norigin of memory, and thus of the psyche. Only this di\ufb00erence enables\na \u201cpathway to be preferred (Wegbevorzugung)\u201d: \u201cMemory is represented\n(dargestellt) by the di\ufb00erences in the facilitations of the \u03c8,-neurones\u201d (1,\n300). We then must not say that breaching without di\ufb00erence is in-\nsu\ufb03cient for memory; it must be stipulated that there is no pure\nwriting and difference\n252\n"

Trace as memory is not a pure breaching\nthat might be reappropriated at any time as simple presence; it is rather\nthe ungraspable and invisible di\ufb00erence between breaches. We thus\nalready know that psychic life is neither the transparency of meaning\nnor the opacity of force but the di\ufb00erence within the exertion of forces.\nAs Nietzsche had already said.3\nThat quantity becomes psyche\u00af and mne\u00afme\u00af through di\ufb00erences rather\nthan through plenitudes will be continuously con\ufb01rmed in the Project\nitself. Repetition adds no quantity of present force, no intensity; it repro-\nduces the same impression\u2014yet it has the power of breaching. \u201cThe\nmemory of an experience (that is, its continuing operative power)\ndepends on a factor which is called the magnitude of the impression\nand on the frequency with which the same impression is repeated\u201d (I,\n300). The number of repetitions is thus added to the quantity (Q\u03b7) of\nthe excitation, and these two quantities are of two absolutely hetero-\ngeneous types. There are only discrete repetitions, and they can act as\nsuch only through the diastem which maintains their separation.\nFinally, if breaching can supplement a quantity presently at work, or\ncan be added to it, it is because breaching is certainly analogous to\nquantity, but is other than it as well: \u201cquantity plus facilitation resul-\nting from Q\u03b7 are at the same time something that can replace Q\u03b7\u201d (I,\n300\u2013301). Let us not hasten to de\ufb01ne this other of pure quantity\nas quality: for in so doing we would be transforming the force\nof memory into present consciousness and the translucid perception of\npresent qualities. Thus, neither the di\ufb00erence between full quantities,\nnor the interval between repetitions of the identical, nor breaching\nitself, may be thought of in terms of the opposition between quantity\nand quality.4 Memory cannot be derived from this opposition, and it\nescapes the grasp of \u201cnaturalism\u201d as well as of \u201cphenomenology.\u201d\nAll these di\ufb00erences in the production of the trace may be reinter-\npreted as moments of deferring. In accordance with a motif which will\ncontinue to dominate Freud\u2019s thinking, this movement is described as\nthe e\ufb00ort of life to protect itself by deferring a dangerous cathexis, that is,\nby constituting a reserve (Vorrat). The threatening expenditure or pres-\nence are deferred with the help of breaching or repetition. Is this not\nalready the detour (Aufschub, lit. delay) which institutes the relation of\npleasure to reality (Beyond . . . ., SE, XVIII)? Is it not already death at the\nfreud and the scene of writing 253\n"

Or rather: as di\ufb00\u00e9rance is\nnot an essence, as it is not anything, it is not life, if Being is determined\nas ousia, presence, essence/existence, substance or subject. Life must be\nthought of as trace before Being may be determined as presence. This is\nthe only condition on which we can say that life is death, that repetition\nand the beyond of the pleasure principle are native and congenital to\nthat which they transgress. When Freud writes in the Project that \u201cfacili-\ntations serve the primary function,\u201d he is forbidding us to be surprised\nby Beyond the Pleasure Principle. He complies with a dual necessity: that of\nrecognizing di\ufb00\u00e9rance at the origin, and at the same time that of crossing\nout the concept of primariness: we will not, then, be surprised by the\nTraumdeutung, which de\ufb01nes primariness as a \u201ctheoretical \ufb01ction\u201d in a\nparagraph on the \u201cdelaying\u201d (Versp\u00e4tung) of the secondary process. It is\nthus the delay which is in the beginning.5 Without which, di\ufb00\u00e9rance\nwould be the lapse which a consciousness, a self-presence of the pres-\nent, accords itself. To defer (di\ufb00\u00e9rer) thus cannot mean to retard a present\npossibility, to postpone an act, to put o\ufb00 a perception already now\npossible. That possibility is possible only through a di\ufb00\u00e9rance which\nmust be conceived of in other terms than those of a calculus or mech-\nanics of decision.6 To say that di\ufb00\u00e9rance is originary is simultaneously to\nerase the myth of a present origin. Which is why \u201coriginary\u201d must be\nunderstood as having been crossed out, without which di\ufb00\u00e9rance would be\nderived from an original plenitude. It is a non-origin which is\noriginary.\nRather than abandon it, we ought perhaps then to rethink the con-\ncept of di\ufb00\u00e9rer. This is what we should like to do, and this is possible only\nif di\ufb00\u00e9rance is determined outside any teleological or eschatological\nhorizon. Which is not easy. Let us note in passing that the concepts\nof Nachtr\u00e4glichkeit and V\u00e9rspatung, concepts which govern the whole of\nFreud\u2019s thought and determine all his other concepts, are already pres-\nent and named in the Project. The irreducibility of the \u201ce\ufb00ect of\ndeferral\u201d\u2014 such, no doubt, is Freud\u2019s discovery. Freud exploits this\ndiscovery in its ultimate consequences, beyond the psychoanalysis of\nthe individual, and he thought that the history of culture ought to\ncon\ufb01rm it. In Moses and Monotheism (1937), the e\ufb03cacy of delay and of\naction subsequent to the event is at work over large historical intervals.\nfreud and the scene of writing 255\n"

Before the analysis of the Irma dream, Freud engages in\nconsiderations of method. In one of his familiar gestures, he opposes\nthe old popular tradition to so-called scienti\ufb01c psychology. As always,\nit is in order to justify the profound intention which inspires the\nformer. Popular tradition may err, of course, when according to a\n\u201csymbolical\u201d procedure, it treats dream content as an indivisible and\nunarticulated whole, for which a second, possibly prophetic whole\nmay be substituted. But Freud is not far from accepting the \u201cother\npopular method\u201d: \u201cIt might be described as the \u2018decoding\u2019 method\n(Chi\ufb00riermethode), since it treats dreams as a kind of cryptography\n(Geheimschrift) in which each sign can be translated into another sign\nhaving a known meaning, in accordance with a \ufb01xed key (Schl\u00fcssel)\u201d (IV,\n97). Let us retain the allusion to a permanent code: it is the weakness of\na method to which Freud attributes, nevertheless, the merit of being\nanalytic and of spelling out the elements of meaning one by one.\nA strange example, the one chosen by Freud to illustrate this trad-\nitional procedure: a text of phonetic writing is cathected and functions\nas a discrete, speci\ufb01c, translatable and unprivileged element in the\noverall writing of the dream. Phonetic writing as writing within writ-\ning. Assume, for example, says Freud, that I have dreamed of a letter\n(Brief / epistola), then of a burial. Open a Traumbuch, a book in which the\nkeys to dreams are recorded, an encyclopedia of dream signs, the\ndream dictionary which Freud will soon reject. It teaches us that letter\nmust be translated (\u00fcbersetzen) by spite, and burial by engagement to be\nmarried. Thus a letter (epistola) written with letters (litterae), a document\ncomposed of phonetic signs, the transcription of verbal discourse, may\nbe translated by a nonverbal signi\ufb01er which, inasmuch as it is a deter-\nmined a\ufb00ect, belongs to the overall syntax of dream writing. The verbal\nis cathected, and its phonetic transcription is bound, far from the cen-\nter, in a web of silent script.\nFreud then borrows another example from Artemidorous of Daldis\n(second century), the author of a treatise on the interpretation of\ndreams. Let it be a pretext for recalling that in the eighteenth century an\nEnglish theologian, known to Freud, had already invoked Artemidorus\nwith an intention that is doubtless worthy of comparison.9 Warburton\nwriting and difference\n260\n"

And, in fact, Freud never stopped proposing codes, rules of\ngreat generality. And the substitution of signi\ufb01ers seems to be the\nessential activity of psychoanalytic interpretation. Certainly, Freud\nnevertheless stipulates an essential limitation on this activity. Or, rather,\na double limitation.\nIf we consider \ufb01rst verbal expression, as it is circumscribed in the\ndream, we observe that its sonority, the materiality of the expression,\ndoes not disappear before the signi\ufb01ed, or at least cannot be traversed\nand transgressed as it is in conscious speech. It acts as such, with the\ne\ufb03cacy Artaud assigned it on the stage of cruelty.12The materiality of a\nword cannot be translated or carried over into another language.\nMateriality is precisely that which translation relinquishes. To relin-\nquish materiality: such is the driving force of translation. And when\nthat materiality is reinstated, translation becomes poetry.

We are speaking here of the way\nin which unconscious thoughts become conscious. If a dream cannot\nbe translated into another language, it is because within the psychical\napparatus as well there is never a relation of simple translation. We are\nwrong, Freud tells us, to speak of translation or transcription in\ndescribing the transition of unconscious thoughts through the pre-\nconscious toward consciousness.
