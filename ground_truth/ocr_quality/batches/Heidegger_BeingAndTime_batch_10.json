This must be conceded. But does \nthis everyday experience thus give us any guarantee that the full possible \ncontent of the call of the voice of conscience has been heard therein ? \nDoes it follow from this that theories of conscience which are based on the \nordinary way of experiencing it have made certain that their ontological \n293 \nhorizon for analysing this phenomenon is an appropriate one ? Does not \nfalling, which is an essential kind of Being for Dasein, show us rather that \nontically this entity understands itself proximally and for the most part \nin terms of the horizon of concern, but that ontologically, it defines \n\"Being\" in the sense of presence-at-hand ? This, however, leads to cover-\ning up the phenomenon in two ways: what one sees in this theory is a \nsequence of Experiences or 'psychical processes' -a sequence whose kind \nof Being is for the most part wholly indefinite. In such experience the \nconscience is encountered as an arbiter and admonisher, with whom \nDasein reckons and pleads its cause. \nWhen Kant represented the conscience as a 'court of justice' and made \nthis the basic guiding idea in his Interpretation of it, he did not do so by \naccident; this was suggested by the idea of moral law-although his \nconception of morality was far removed from utilitarianism and eudae\u00ad\nmonism. Even the theory of value, whether it is regarded formally or \nmaterially, has as its unexpressed ontological presupposition a 'metaphysic \nofmorals'-that is, an ontology ofDasein and existence. Dasein is regarded \nas an entity with which one might concern oneself, whether this \"concern\" \nhas the sense of 'actualizing values' or of satisfying a norm. \nIf one is to invoke the full range of what the everyday experience of \nconscience-as the only higher court for the Interpretation of conscience\u00ad\nis acquainted with, this cannot be justified unless one has considered \nbeforehand whether the conscience \ncan ever become authentically \naccessible here at all. \nThus the further objection that the existential Interpretation overlooks \nthe fact that the call of conscience always relates itself to some definite \ndeed which has been either 'actualized' or willed, also loses its force. \n1 'Das warnende Gewissen hat die Funktion der momentweisen Regelung eines \nFreibleibens von Verschuldungen.'

As little as the 'good' conscience lets itself be put in the \nservice of a 'Pharisaism', just as little may the function of the 'bad' con\u00ad\nscience be reduced to indicating indebtednesses which are present-at-hand \nor thrusting aside those which are possible. This would be as if Dasein \nwere a 'household' whose indebtednesses simply need to be balanced off \nin an orderly manner so that the Self may stand 'by' as a disinterested \nspectator while these Experiences run their course. \nIf, however, that which is primary in the call is not a relatedness to a \nguilt which is factically 'present-at-hand', or to some guilt-charged deed \n294 \nwhich has been factically willed, and if accordingly the 'reproving' and \n'warning' types of conscience express no primordial call-functions, then \nwe have also undermined the consideration we mentioned first, that the \nexistential Interpretation fails to recognize the 'essentially' critical char\u00ad\nacter of what the conscience does. This consideration too is one that \nsprings from catching sight of the phenomenon in a manner which, \nwithin certain limits, is genuine ; for in the content of the call, one can \nindeed point to nothing which the voice 'positively' recommends and \nimposes. But how are we to understand this positivity which is missing in \nwhat the conscience does ? Does it follow from this that conscience has a \n'negative' character ? \nWe miss a 'positive' content in that which is called, because we expect \nto be told something currentry useful about assured possibilities of 'taking action' \nwhich are available and calculable. This expectation has its basis within the \nhorizon of that way of interpreting which belongs to common-sense \nconcern-a way of interpreting which forces Dasein's existence to be \nsubsumed under the idea of a business procedure that can be regulated. \nSuch expectations (and in part these tacitly underlie even the demand \nfor a material ethic of value as contrasted with one that is 'merely' formal) \nare of course disappointed by the conscience. The cal of conscience fails \nto give any such 'practical' injunctions, solery because it sumons Dasein \nto existence, to its ownmost potentiality-for-Being-its-Self. With the \nmaxims which one might be led to expect-maxims which could be \nreckoned up unequivocally-the conscience would deny to existence \nnothing less than the very possibility of taking action. But because the con\u00ad\nscience manifestly cannot be 'positive' in this manner, neither does it \nfunction \u008aust negatively' in this same manner. The call discloses nothing \n"

The understanding of the appeal is a mode ofDasein's \nBeing, and only as such does it give us the phenomenal content of what the \ncall of conscience attests. The authentic understanding of the call has been \ncharacterized as \"wanting to have a conscience\". This is a way of letting \none's ownmost Self take action in itself of its own accord in its Being\u00ad\nguilty, and represents phenomenally that authentic potentiality-for-Being \nwhich Dasein itself attests. The existential structure of this must now be \nlaid bare. Only so can we proceed to the basic constitution of the authenti\u00ad\nciry of Dasein's existence as disclosed in Dasein itself. \nWanting to have a conscience is, as an understanding of oneself in \none's ownmost potentiality-for-Being, a way in which Dasein has been \ndisclosed. This disclosedness is constituted by discourse and state-of-mind, \nas well as by understanding. To understand in an existentiell manner \nimplies projecting oneself in each case upon one's ownmost factical pos\u00ad\nsibility of having the potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world. But the poten\u00ad\ntialiry-for-Being is understood only by existing in this possibility. \nWhat kind of mood corresponds to such understanding? Understanding \nthe call discloses one's own Dasein in the uncanniness of its individualiza-\n296 \ntion. The uncanniness which is revealed in understanding and revealed \nalong with it, becomes genuinely disclosed by the state-of-mind of anxiety \nwhich belongs to that understanding. The fact of the anxiery of conscience, \ngives us phenomenal confirmation that in understanding the call Dasein \nis brought face to face with its own uncanniness. Wanting-to-have-a\u00ad\nconscience becomes a readiness for anxiety. \nThe third essential item in disclosedness is discourse. The call itself is a \nprimordial kind of discourse for Dasein ; but there is no corresponding \ncounter-discourse in which, let us say, one talks about what the con\u00ad\nscience has said, and pleads one's cause. In hearing the call understand\u00ad\ningly, one denies oneself any counter-discourse, not because one has been \nassailed by some 'obscure power', which suppresses one's hearing, but \nbecause this hearing has appropriated the content of the call uncon\u00ad\ncealedly. In the call one's constant Being-guilty is represented, and in this \nway the Self is brought back from the loud idle talk which goes with the \ncommon sense of the \"they\". Thus the mode of Articulative discourse \nwhich belongs to wanting to have a conscience, is one of reticence. Keeping \nsilent has been characterized as an essential possibility of discourse.lx \nAnyone who keeps silent when he wants to give us to understand some\u00ad\nthing, must 'have something to say'. In the appeal Dasein gives itself to \nunderstand its ownmost potentiality-for-Being. This calling is therefore a \nkeeping-silent. The discourse of the conscience never comes to utterance. \n"

Only in reticence, therefore, is this silent \ndiscourse understood appropriately in wanting to have a conscience. It \ntakes the words away from the common-sense idle talk of the \"they\". \nThe common-sense way of interpreting the conscience, which 'sticks \nrigorously to the facts', takes the silent discourse of the conscience as an \noccasion for passing it off as something which is not at all ascertainable \nor present-at-hand. The fact that \"they\", who hear and understand \nnothing but loud idle talk, cannot 'report' any call, is held against the \nconscience on the subterfuge that it is 'dumb' and manifestly not present\u00ad\nat-hand. With this kind of interpretation the \"they\" merely covers up its \nown failure to hear the call and the fact that its 'hearing' does not reach \nvery far. \nThe disclosedness of Dasein in wanting to have a conscience, is thus \nconstituted by anxiety as state-of-mind, by understanding as a projection \nof oneself upon one's ownmost Being-guilty, and by discourse as reticence. \nThis distinctive and authentic disclosedness, which is attested in Dasein \nitself by its conscience-this reticent self-projection upon one's ownmost Being-\n297 \nguilty, in which one is ready for anxiety-we call \"resoluteness\". \nResoluteness is a distinctive mode of Dasein's disclosedness.1 In an \nearlier passage, however, we have Interpreted disclosedness existentially \nas the primordial truth,x Such truth is primarily not a quality of 'judgment' \nnor of any definite way ofbehaving, but something essentially constitutive \nfor Being-in-the-world as such.

In understanding significance, concernful \nDasein submits itself circumspectively to what it encounters as ready\u00ad\nto-hand. Any discovering of a totality of involvements goes back to a \n\"for-the-sake-of-which\" ; and on the understanding of such a \"for-the-sake\u00ad\nof-which\" is based in turn the understanding of significance as the disclosed\u00ad\nness of the current world.

At the same time those facti\u00ad\ncal projections which are closest to it, have been guided by its concernful \nlostness in the \"they\". To this lostness, one's own Dasein can appeal, and \nthis appeal can be understood in the way of resoluteness. But in that case \nthis authentic disclosedness modifies with equal primordiality both the way \nin which the 'world' is discovered (and this is founded upon that dis\u00ad\nclosedness) and the way in which the Dasein-with of Others is disclosed. \nThe 'world' which is ready-to-hand does not become another one 'in its \n298 \ncontent', nor does the circle of Others get exchanged for a new one ; but \nboth one's Being towards the ready-to-hand understandingly and con\u00ad\ncernfully, and one's solicitous Being with Others, are now given a \ndefinite character in terms of their ownmost potentiality-for-Being\u00ad\ntheir-Selves. \nResoluteness, as authentic Being-one' s-Selj, does not detach Dasein from \nits world, nor does it isolate it so that it becomes a free-floating \"I\".

Dasein's resolute\u00ad\nness towards itself is what first makes it possible to let the Others who are \nwith it 'be' in their ownmost potentiality-for-Being, and to co-disclose \nthis potentiality in the solicitude which leaps forth and liberates. When \nDasein is resolute, it can become the 'conscience' of Others.

But on what basis does Dasein \ndisclose itself in resoluteness ? On what is it to resolve ?1 Only the resolution \nitself can give the answer. One would completely misunderstand the \nphenomenon of resoluteness if one should want to suppose that this con\u00ad\nsists simply in taking up possibilities which have been proposed and \nrecommended, and seizing hold of them. The resolution is precisely the dis\u00ad\nclosive projection and determination of what is factically possible at the tim.

Dasein, as a they-self, gets 'lived' \nby the common-sense ambiguity of that publicness in which nobody \nresolves upon anything but which has always made its decision.11 \"Reso\u00ad\nluteness\" signifies letting oneself be summoned out of one's lostness in the \n\"they\".

Care, however, as \n1 'Es kennt nur die \"allgemeine Lage\", verliert sich an die nachsten \"Gelegenheiten\" und \nbestreitet das Dasein aus der Verrechnung der \"Zufalle\", die es, sie verkennend, ftir die \neigene Leis tung halt und ausgibt.' We have preserved the grammatical ambiguity of the \npronouns 'die' and 'es'. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n als die im Grunde des Daseins beschlossene Seinsart \n.\n\u2022\n.\n ' The participle 'be\u00ad\nschlossene', which is etymologically akin to 'erschlossen', etc., may mean either 'included \nor 'decided upon', as we have seen on H. 299\u00b7 Very likely both meanings are here in\u00ad\ntended. \n3 'Die Entschlossenheit stellt sich nicht erst, kenntnisnehmend, eine Situation vor, \nsondern hat sich schon in sie gestellt.' Our rather literal translation brings out the contrast \nbetween 'sich stellen in .\n\u2022\n .' ('put itself in . .  .') and 'sich stellen \u2022\n.\n.\n vor . .  .' ('put before \nitself . . .  '), but fails to bring out the important sense of the latter expression : 'to represent' \nor 'to form an idea of'. \n\" '  \"Handeln\" '. Far from avoiding this term, Heidegger has used it quite frequently. \nBut he is avoiding it as a possible substitute for the term 'Entschlossenheit'. \n"

So long as we do not forget this, every step in our Interpretation \nmust be guided by the idea of existence. What this signifies for the question \nof the possible connection between anticipation and resoluteness, is \nnothing less than the demand that we should project these existential \n303 \nphenomena upon the existentiell possibilities which have been delineated \nin them, and 'think these possibilities through to the end' in an existential \nmanner. If we do this, the working-out of anticipatory resoluteness as a \npotentiality-for-Being-a-whole such that this potentiality is authentic and \nis possible in an existentiell way, will lose the character of an arbitrary \nconstruction. It will have become a way of Interpreting whereby Dasein \nis liberated for its uttermost possibility of existence. \nIn taking this step, the existential Interpretation makes known at the \nsame time its ownmost methodological character.

But the \nInterpretation of the ontological meaning of care must be performed on the basis of \nenvisaging phenomenologically in a full and constant manner Dasein's existential \nconstitution as we have exhibited it up till now. \nOntologically, Dasein is in principle different from everything that is \npresent-at-hand or Real. Its 'subsistence' is not based on the substan\u00ad\ntiality of a substance but on the 'Self-subsistence' of the existing Self, whose \nBeing has been conceived as care.1 The phenomenon of the Self-a \nphenomenon which is included in care-needs to be defined existentially \nin a way which is primordial and authentic, in contrast to our preparatory \nexhibition of the inauthentic they-self. Along with this, we must establish \nwhat possible ontological questions are to be directed towards the 'Self', \nif indeed it is neither substance nor subject. \nIn this way, the phenomenon of care will be adequately clarified for \nthe first time, and we shall then interrogate it as to its ontological meaning. \nWhen this meaning has been determined, temporality will have been laid \nbare. In exhibiting this, we are not led into out-of-the-way and sequestered \n304 \ndomains of Dasein; we merely get a conception of the entire phenomenal \ncontent of Dasein's basic existential constitution in the ultimate founda-\ntions of its own ontological intelligibility. Temporality gets experienced in-a \nphenomenally primordial way in Dasein's authentic Being-a-whole, in the phenom-\nenon of anticipatory resoluteness. If temporality makes itself known primordi-\nally in this, then we may suppose that the temporality of anticipatory \nresoluteness is a distinctive mode of temporality. Temporality has different \npossibilities and different ways of temporali;:;ing itself. 2 The basic possibilities \n1 'Sein \"Bestand\" griindet nicht in der Substanzialitiit einer Substanz, sondem in der \n\"Selbstiindigkeit\" des existierenden Selbst, dessen Sein als Sorge begriffen wurde.' \nIn this sentence Heidegger has used no less than five words derived from the Indo\u00ad\nEuropean base 'sta-' (Cf. English 'stand', Latin 'stare', German 'stehen') : 'Bestand', \n'Substanz', 'Substantialitit', 'Selbstiindigkeit', 'existierenden'. In each case we have used \nan English equivalent derived from the same base. \nThe ii;nportant word 'Bestand', which we have here translated somewhat arbitrarily \nas 'subsistence', and have often handled elsewhere in other ways, corresponds to the verb \n'bestehen' ('to subsist', 'to remain', 'to consist in', even 'to exist' in a broader sense than \nHeidegger's). It thus may stand for 'subsistence' in the broadest sense, or more particularly \nfor 'continued subsistence' ; and it may also stand for that of which something 'consists'\u00ad\nits 'content', the whole 'stock' of things of which it consists. This is the sense in which \nHeidegger most frequently uses it, especially in such phrases as 'der phiinomenale Best\u00ad\nand' ('the phenomenal content', 'the stock of phenomena'). \nWe have also somewhat arbitrarily translated 'Selbstiindigkeit' as 'Self-subsistence', in \naccordance with our translation of the adjective 'selbstiindig' on H. 291-!292\u00b7 But as we \nshall see later (H. 322), 'Self-constancy' would perhaps be more appropriate. \n2 'Zeitlichkeit kann sich in verschiedenen Moglichkeiten und in verschiedener Weise \nuitigen.' In ordinary German the verb 'zeitigen' means 'to bring about' or more strictly, \n'to bring to maturity' ; this is how we have translated it in the earlier portions of this work. \nIn the present section, however, and in those which follow, Heidegger is exploiting the \netymological connection of 'zeitigen' with such words as 'Zeit' ('time') and 'Zeitlichkeit' \n('temporality') ; we have accordingly ventured to translate it as 'to tempt>ralize.'

So one must not be surprised if, at first glance, temporality \ndoes not correspond to that which is accessible to the ordinary under\u00ad\nstanding as 'time'. Thus neither the way time is conceived in our ordinary \nexperience of it, nor the problematic which arises from this experience, \ncan function without examination as a criterion for the appropriateness \nof an Interpretation of time.

Thus, when \ntemporality has been laid bare, there arises for the existential analytic \nthe task of repeating our analysis of Dasein in the sense of Interpreting its \nessential structures with regard to their temporality.

This understanding, however, is to be \ngrasped primordially only on the basis of a primordial Interpretation of \nDasein, in which we take the idea of existence as our clue.

When it is objected that \nthe existential Interpretation is 'circular', it is said that we have 'pre\u00ad\nsupposed' the idea of existence and of Being in general, and that Dasein \ngets Interpreted 'accordingly', so that the idea of Being may be obtained \nfrom it. But what does 'presupposition' signify ? In positing the idea of \nexistence, do we also posit some proposition from which we deduce \nfurther propositions about the Being ofDasein, in accordance with formal \nrules of consistency ? Or does this pre-supposing have the character of an \nunderstanding projection, in such a manner indeed that the Interpretation \nby which such an understanding gets developed, will let that which is to \n3 I 5 \nbe interpreted put itself into words for the very first time, so that it may decide \nof its own accord whether, as the entiry which it is, it has that state of Being for \nwhich it has been disclosed in the projection with regard to its formal aspects ?1 Is \n1 'Oder hat dieses Voraus-setzcn den Charakter des verstehenden Entwerfens, so zwar, \nclass die solches Verstehen ausbildende Interpretation das Auszulegende gerade erst selbst \nzu Wort kommen liisst, damit es von suh aus entscheide, ob es als dieses Seiende die Seinsverfassung \nhergibt, auf welche es im Entwurf formalanzeigend erschlossen wurde ?'

The \nstructure of care, however, seems to be precisely where the attempt to \ngrasp the whole ofDasein as a phenomenon has foundered. The \"ahead-of\u00ad\nitself\" presented itself as a \"not-yet\". Byt when the \"ahead-of-itself\" which \nhad been characterized as something still outstanding, was considered in \ngenuinely existential manner, it revealed itself as Being-towards-the-end\u00ad\nsomething which, in the depths ofits Being, every Dasein is. We made it plain \nat the same time that in the call of conscience care sumons Dasein towards \nits ownmost potentiality-for-Being. When we came to understand in a prim\u00ad\nordial manner how this appeal is understood, we saw that the understand\u00ad\ning of it manifests itself as anticipatory resoluteness, which includes an \nauthentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole-a potentiality of Dasein. Thus \nthe care-structure does not speak against the possibility of Being-a-whole \nbut is the condition for the possibility of such an existentiell potentiality-for\u00ad\nBeing. In the course of these analyses, it became plain that the existential \nphenomena of death, conscience, and guilt are anchored in the pheno\u00ad\nmenon of care. The totality of the structural whole has become even more richly \narticulated; and because of thir, the exirtential question of the unity of thir totality \nhas become still more urgent. \nHow are we to conceive this unity? How can Dasein exist as a unity in \nthe ways and possibilities of its Being which we have mentioned ? Mani\u00ad\nfestly, it can so exist only in such a way that it ir itself this Being in its \nessential possibilities-that in each case I am this entity. The 'I' seems to \n'hold together' the totality of the structural whole. In the 'ontology' of \nthis entity, the 'I' and the 'Self' have been conceived from the earliest \ntimes as the supporting ground (as substance or subject) . Even in its \npreparatory characterization of everydayness, our analytic has already \ncome up against the question of Dasein's \"who\". It has been shown that \nproximally and for the most part Dasein is not itself but is lost in the they\u00ad\nself, which is an existentiell modification of the authentic Self. The \nquestion of the ontological constitution of Selfhood has remained un\u00ad\nanswered. In principle, of course, we have already fixed upon a clue for \nthis problem ;xu for if the Self belongs to the essential [wesenhaften] attri-\n31 8  \nbutes of Dasein, while Dasein's 'Essence' [\"Essenz\"] lies in exirtence, then \n\"1\"-hood and Selfhood must be conceived exirtentially. On the negative \nside, it has also been shown that our ontological characterization of the \n\"they\" prohibits us from making any use of categories of presence-at-\nhand (such as substance) .

In saying \"1\", \nDasein expresses itself about 'itself'. It is not necessary that in doing so \nDasein should make any utterance. With the '1', this entity has itself in \nview. The content of this expression is regarded as something utterly \nsimple. In each case, it just stands for me and nothing further. Also, this \n'1', as something simple, is not an attribute of other Things ; it is not \nitself a predicate, but the absolute 'subject'. What is expressed and what is \naddressed in saying \"I\", is always met as the same persisting something. \nThe characteristics of'simplicity', 'substantiality', and 'personality', which \nKant, for instance, made the basis for his doctrine 'of the paralogisms of \npure reason' ,xv arise from a genuine pre-phenomenological experience. \nThe question remains whether that which we have experienced ontically \nin this way may be Interpreted ontologically with the help of the 'cate\u00ad\ngories' mentioned. \nKant, indeed, in strict conformity with the phenomenal content given in \nsaying \"I\", shows that theontical theses about thesoul-substancewhichhave \nbeen inferred [erschlossenen] from these characteristics, are without justifi\u00ad\ncation. But in so doing, he merely rejects a wrong ontical explanation of the \n\"I\" ; he has by no means achieved an ontological Interpretation ofSelfhood, \nnor has he even obtained some assurance of it and made positive preparation \nfor it. Kant makes a more rigorous attempt than his predecessors to keep \nhold of the phen<;>menal content of saying \"I\" ; yet even though in theory \nhe has denied that the ontical foundations of the ontology of the substantial \n3 I 9 \napply to the \"I\", he still slips back into this same inappropriate ontology. This \nwill be shown more exactly, in order that we may establish what it means \nontologically to take saying \"I\" as the starting-point for the analysis of \nSelf hood. The Kantian analysis of the 'I think' is now to be adduced as an \nillustration, but only so far as is demanded for clarifying these problems.xvi \nThe 'I' is a bare consciousness, accompanying all concepts.

In \nKant's sense we must take saying \"I\" as saying \"I think\". Kant tries to \nestablish the phenomenal content of the \"I\" as res cogitans. If in doing so \nhe calls this \"I\" a 'logical subject', that does not mean that the \"I\" in \ngeneral is a concept obtained merely by way oflogic. The \"I\" is rather the \nsubject of logical behaviour, of binding together. 'I think' means 'I bind \ntogether'. All binding together is an 'I bind together'. In any taking\u00ad\ntogether or relating, the \"I\" always underlies-the V1TOK\u00a3lJL\u00a3vov. The \nsubjectum is therefore 'consciousness in itself', not a representation but \nrather the 'form' of representation. That is to say, the \"I think\" is not \nsomething represented, but the formal structure of representing as such, \nand this formal structure alone makes it possible for anything to have \nbeen represented. When we speak of the \"form\" of representation, we \nhave in view neither a framework nor a universal concept, but that which, \nas \u00a31Sos, makes every representing and everything represented be \nwhat it is. If the \"I\" is understood as the form of representation, this \namounts to saying that it is the 'logical subject'. \nKant's analysis has two positive aspects. For one thing, he sees the \nimpossibility of ontically reducing the \"I\" to a substance ; for another \n320 \nthing, he holds fast to the \"I\" as 'I think'. Nevertheless, he takes this \"I\" \nas subject again, and he does so in a sense which is ontologically inappro\u00ad\npriate. For the ontological concept of the subject characterizes not the Self-\nhood of the \"!\" qua Self, but the selfsameness and steadiness of something that is \nalways present-at-hand. To define the \"I\" ontologically as \"subject\" means \nto regard it as something always present-at-hand. The\u00b7 Being of the \"I\" \nis understood as the Reality of the res cogitans.xix \nBut how does it come about that while the 'I think' gives Kant a \ngenuine phenomenal starting-point, he cannot exploit it ontologically, and \nhas to fall back on the 'subject'-that is to say, something substantial? The \n321 \n\"I\" is not just an 'I think', but an 'I think something'. And does not \nKant himself keep on stressing that the \"I\" remains related to its repre\u00ad\nsentations, and would be nothing without them ? \nFor Kant, however, these representations are the 'empirical', which is \n'accompanied' by the \"1\"-the appearances to which the \"I\" 'clings'. \nKant nowhere shows the kind ofBeing of this 'clinging' and 'accompany\u00ad\ning'. At bottom, however, their kind ofBeing is understood as the constant \nBeing-present-at-hand of the \"I\" along with its representations. Kant has \nindeed avoided cutting the \"I\" adrift from thinking ; but he has done so \nwithout starting with the 'I think' itself in its full essential content as an \n"

Yet one is that with which one concerns oneself. In the \n'natural' ontical way in which the \"I\" talks, the phenomenal content of \nthe Dasein which one has in view in the \"l\" gets overlooked ; but this gives \nno justification for our joining in this overlooking of it, or for forcing upon the \nproblematic of the Self an inappropriate 'categorial' horizon when we \nInterpret the \"I\" ontologically. \nOf course by thus refusing to follow the everyday way in which the \"I\" \n1 'Durch das Verfallen des Daseins, als welches es vor sich selbst jlieht in das Man.' \nThe 'es' appears only in the later editions. \n11 'Die \"natiirliche\" Ich-Rede vollzieht das Man-selbst.' \n"

If the \nontological constitution of the Self is not to be traced back either to an \n\"!\"-substance or to a 'subject', but if, on the contrary, the everyday \nfugitive way in which we keep on saying \"I\" must be understood in terms \nof our authentic potentiality-for-Being, then the proposition that the Self \nis the basis of care and constantly present-at-hand, is one that still does \nnot follow.

In terms of care the constancy of the Self, as the \nsupposed persistence of the subjectum, gets clarified. But the phenomenon \nof this authentic potentiality-for-Being also opens our eyes for the constancy \nof the Self in the sense of its having achieved some sort of position.1 The \nconstancy of the Self, in the double sense of steadiness and steadfastness, is \nthe authentic counter-possibility to the non-Self-constancy which is charac\u00ad\nteristic of irresolute falling. 2 Existentially, \"Self-constancy\" signifies nothing \nother than anticipatory resoluteness. The ontological structure of such \nresoluteness reveals the existentiality of the Self's Selfhood. \nDasein is authentical[v itself in the primordial individualization of the \nreticent resoluteness which exacts anxiety of itself. As something that keeps \n323 \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n , fiir die Stiindigkeit des Selbst in dem Sinn des Standgewonnenhabens.' Here our \nusual translation of 'Stiindigkeit' as 'constancy' seems inadequate; possibly 'stability' \nwould be closer to what is meant. \n1 'Die Stiindigkeit des Selbst im Doppelsinne der bestiindigen Standfestigkeit ist die \neigentlicM Gegenmoglichkeit zur Unselbst-standigkeit des unentschlossenen Verfallens.' \nThe italicization of the opening words of this sentence appears only in the later editions. \nHere, as on H. 117 and 303, Heidegger exploits various meanings of the adjective \n'standig' and other words derived from the base 'sta-', with the root-meaning of \n'standing'. The noun 'Unselbstiindigkeit' ordinarily stands for inability to stand on \none's own feet or to make up one's mind independently. \u00b7 But Heidegger expands it \nto 'Unselbst-stiindigkeit', which not only suggests instability and a failure to stand by \noneself, but also the constancy or stability of that which. is other than the Selm-the \nnon-Self, or more specifically, the they-self. In the followmg sentence the no_un Sel\u0326\u00ad\nstiindigkeit', which ordinarily stands for autonomy, independence, or self-subsistence, IS \nsimilarly expanded to 'Selbst-stiindigkeit'-'Self-constancy'. \n"

The Self which the reticence of resolute existence un\u00ad\nveils is the primordial phenomenal basis for the question as to the Being \nof the 'I'. Only if we are oriented phenomenally by the meaning of the \nBeing of the authentic potentiality-for-Being-one's-Self are we put in a \nposition to discuss what ontological justification there is for treating \nsubstantiality, simplicity, and personality as characteristics of Selfhood. \nIn the prevalent way of saying \"I\", it is constantly suggested that what \nwe have in advance is a Self-Thing, persistently present-at-hand ; the \nontological question of the Being of the Self must turn away from any \nsuch suggestion. \nCare does not need to be founded in a Self. But existentiality, as constitutive for \ncare, provides the ontological constitution of Dasein's Self-constancy, to which there \nbelongs, in accordance with the full structural content of care, its Being-fallen \nfactically into non-Self-constancy. When fully conceived, the care-structure \nincludes the phenomenon of Selfhood. This phenomenon is clarified by \nInterpreting the meaning of care ; and it is as care that Dasein's totality \nof Being has been defined. \n\u0255 65. Temporality as the Ontological Meaning of Care \nIn characterizing the 'connection' between care and Selfhood, our aim \nwas not only to clarify the special problem of \"I\"-hood, but also to help \nin the final preparation for getting into our grasp phenomenally the \ntotality of Dasein's structural whole. We need the unwavering discipline of \nthe existential way of putting the question, if, for our ontological point of \nview, Dasein's kind of Being is not to be finally perverted into a mode of \npresence-at-hand, even one which is wholly undifferentiated. Dasein \nbecomes 'essentially' Dasein in that authentic existence which constitutes \nitself as anticipatory resoluteness.1 Such resoluteness, as a mode of the \nauthenticity of care, contains Dasein's primordial Self-constancy and \ntotality. We must take an undistracted look at these and understand \nthem existentially if we are to lay bare the ontological meaning ofDasein's \nBeing. \nWhat are we seeking ontologically with the meaning of care ? What \n324 \ndoes \"meaning\" signify ? In our investigation, we have encountered this \nphenomenon in connection with the analysis of understanding and inter\u00ad\npretation.xxH According to that analysis, meaning is that wherein the \nunderstandability [Verstehbarkeit] of something maintains itself-even \n1 'Das Dasein wird \"wesentlich\" in der eigentlichen Existenz, die sich als vorlaufende \nEntschlossenheit konstituiert.' \n"

Projecting discloses possibilities-that is to say, it \ndiscloses the sort of thing that makes possible. \nTo lay bare the \"upon-which\" of a projection, amounts to disclosing \nthat which makes possible what has been projected.1 To lay it bare in this \nway requires methodologically that we study the projection (usually a \ntacit one) which underlies an interpretation, and that we do so in such a \nway that what has been projected in the projecting can be disclosed and \ngrasped with regard to its \"upon-which\". To set forth the meaning of \ncare means, then, to follow up the projection which guides and underlies \nthe primordial existential Interpretation of Dasein, and to follow it up in \nsuch a way that in what is here projected, its \"upon-which\" may be seen. \nWhat has been projected is the Being of Dasein, and it is disclosed in what \nconstitutes that Being as an authentic potentiality-for-Being-a-whole. 2 \nThat upon which the Being which has been disclosed and is thus con\u00ad\nstituted has been projected, is that which itself makes possible this Con\u00ad\nstitution of Being as care. When we inquire about the meaning of care, we \nare asking what makes possible the totality of the articulated structural whole of \ncare, in the unity of its articulation as we have unfolded it. \nTaken strictly, \"meaning\" signifies the \"upon-which\" of the primary \nprojection of the understanding of Being. When Being-in-the-world has \nbeen disclosed to itself and understands the Being of that entity which it \nitself is, it understands equiprimordial\u00eay the Being of entities discovered \nwithin-the-world, even if such Being has not been made a theme, and has \nnot yet even been differentiated into its primary modes of existence and \nReality. All ontical experience of entities-both circumspective calcula\u00ad\ntion of the ready-to-hand, and positive scientific cognition of the present\u00ad\nat-hand-is based upon projections of the Being of the corresponding \nentities-projections which in every case are more or less transparent. \nBut in these projections there lies hidden the \"upon-which\" of the \nprojection; and on this, as it were, the understanding of Being nourishes \nitself. \nIf we say that entities 'have meaning', this signifies that they have \nbecome accessible in their Being; and this Being, as projected upon its \n1 'Das Woraufhin eines Entwurfs freilegen, besagt, das erschliessen, was das Entworfene \nermoglicht.'
