At the outset we attributed a twofold character \nto such questions: first, each metaphysical question always encompasses \nthe whole of metaphysics; second, every metaphysical question in each case \nimplicates the questioning Dasein in the question. \n[ 16) To what extent does the question concerning the nothing permeate \nand embrace the whole of metaphysics? \nFor a long time metaphysics has expressed the nothing in a proposition \nclearly susceptible of more than one meaning: ex nih i/o nihil fit - from noth\u00ad\ning, nothing comes to be. Although in discussions of the proposition the \nnothing itself never becomes a problem in its own right, the respective views \nof the nothing nevertheless express the guiding fundamental conception of \nbeings. Ancient metaphysics conceives the nothing in the sense of non be\u00ad\ning, that is, unformed matter, matter that cannot take form as an in-formed \nbeing that would offer an outward aspect (\u00a3l8oc;). To be in being is to be \na self-forming form that exhibits itself as such in an image (as something \nenvisaged). The origins, legitimacy, and limits of this conception of being \nare as little discussed as the nothing itself. On the other hand, Christian \ndogma denies the truth of the proposition ex nihilo nihil fit and thereby be\u00ad\nstows on the nothing a transformed significance, the sense of the complete \nabsence of beings apart from God: ex nih i/o fit - ens creatum [From nothing \ncomes - created being]. Now the nothing becomes the counterconcept to \nthat which properly is, the stmmtum ens, God as ens increatum. Here too \nthe interpretation of the nothing indicates the fundamental conception of \nbeings. But the metaphysical discussion of beings stays on the same level \nas the question of the nothing. The questions of being and of the nothing \nas such are not posed. Therefore no one is bothered by the difficulty that \nif God creates out of nothing precisely he must be able to comport himself \nto the nothing. But if God is God, he cannot know the nothing, assuming \nthat the \"Absolute\" excludes all nothingness. \nThis cursory historical recollection shows the nothing as the counter\u00ad\nconcept to that which properly is, i.e., as its negation. But if the nothing \nsomehow does become a problem, then this opposition does not merely un\u00ad\ndergo a somewhat clearer determination; rather, it awakens for the first time \nthe proper formulation of the metaphysical question concerning the being \nof beings. The nothing does not remain [17] the indeterminate opposite \nof beings but unveils itself as belonging to the being of beings. \n\"Pure Being and pure Nothing are therefore the same.\" This proposition \nof Hegel's (Science of Logic, Book I: Werke, vol. III, p. 74) is correct. Being \nand the nothing do belong together, not because both - from the point of \nview of the Hegelian concept of thought - agree in their indeterminateness \n94 \n"

Yet just as being, as the \"not\" in relation to beings, is by \nno means a nothing in the sense of a nihil negativum, so too the difference, \nas the \"not\" between beings and being, is in no way merely the figment of \na distinction made by our understanding (ens rationis). \nThat nihilative \"not\" of the nothing and this nihilative \"not\" of the \ndifference are indeed not identical, yet they are the Same in the sense of \nbelonging together in the essential prevailing of the being of beings. b The \ntwo essays - which were intentionally kept separate - attempt to determine \nmore closely this Same as what is wonhy of thought, without being equal \nto this task. \nWhat if those who reflect on such matters were to begin at last to enter \nthoughtfully into this same issue that has been waiting for two decades? \na Wtgmarkm, firs[ edition, 1\u00a27: Cf. !:he self-critique of !:his treatise in DtT Satz vum Grond \n(1957), pp. Bzff.

Indeed, \nAristotle was not content merely to list the \"four causes\" alongside one \nanother, but was concerned with understanding their interconnection and \nthe grounding of this fourfold division. This is shown both by his detailed \nanalysis in Book II of the Physics and especially by the way in which the \nquestion of the \"four causes\" is discussed in terms of the \"history of the \nproblem\" in Meuzphysics Book I, chapters 3-7.

In addition, it is clear that in seeking the causes, either all must \nbe sought thus, or they must be sought in one of these ways.)4 Here we \nshall have to omit the history of the problem of ground both prior to and \nafter Aristotle. Wtth respect to the way we plan to approach the prob\u00ad\nlem, however, we may recall the following. Through Leibniz we are fa\u00ad\nmiliar with the problem of ground in the form of the question concern\u00ad\ning the principium ration is suficientis. The \"principle of reason\" [\"Satz vom \nGn'mde j5 was treated for the first time in a monograph by Christian A. \nCrusius in his Philosophical Dissertation concerning the Use and Limits of the \nPrinciple of Determinative and Commonly Sufficient Reason ( 1 74 3), 6 and finally \nby Schopenhauer [2 3] in his dissertation Concerning the Fomfold Root of the \nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason (181 3).7 Yet if the problem of ground is in gen\u00ad\neral bound up with the central questions of metaphysics, then it must also \nbe at iss\\A even where it is not dealt with explicitly in its familiar form. \nThus Kant apparently showed little interest in the \"principle of reason,\" \neven though he explicitly discusses it both at the beginning' and toward the \nend9 of his philosophizing. And yet it stands at the center of his Critique \nof Pure Reason. 10 Of no lesser significance for the problem are Schelling's \nPhilosophical Investigations c011Cerning the Esence of Human Freedom and Re\u00ad\nlated Matters (1809).11 The very reference to Kant and Schelling makes it \nquestionable as to whether the problem of ground is equivalent to that of \nthe \"principle of reason\" and whether it is even raised at all in that prin\u00ad\nciple. If not, then the problem of ground must first be awakened. This, \nhowever, does not exclude the possibility that a discussion of the \"princi\u00ad\nple of reason\" might give rise to such an awakening and provide an initial \npointer. The exposition of the problem, however, is equivalent to attain\u00ad\ning and designating the distinctive J()1tlin within which we may treat of \nthe essence of ground without any claim to make visible that essence at a \nstroke. This domain is shown to be transcendence. This means at the same \ntime that transcendence itself is first determined more originarily and more \ncomprehensively via the problem of ground. \u00d4Any illumination of essence \nthat is a philosophizing one, i.e., an intrinsicaffY finite endeavor, must also \nnecessarily always testify to that nonessencr that drives human knowledge \nin its entire essence.J Accordingly, the structure of what follows is stipu\u00ad\nlated: I. The [24] Problem of Ground; II. Transcendence as the Domain \nof the Question concerning the Essence of Ground; III. On the Essence of \nGround. \n99 \n"

And precisely in undertak\u00ad\ning this he considers it necessary to point out that the apparent self-evidence \nof concepts such as \"truth\" and \"identity\" forestalls any clarification of them \nthat would suffice to demonstrate the origin of the principium rationis and \nthe other axioms. \\Vhat is at issue in the present inquiry, however, is not \nthe derivation of the principium rationis, but an analysis of the problem of \nground. To what extent does this passage from Leibniz provide us with a \nguideline? \nThe principium rationis persists, because without its persistence there \nwould be beings that would have to be without ground. For Leibniz this \nmeans: There would be true things that would resist being resolved into \nidentities, there would be truths that would contravene the \"nature\" of \ntruth in general. Since this is impossible, however, and truth persists, the \nprincipium ration is, since it springs from the essence of truth, also persists. \nThe essence of truth, however, is to be found in the connexio (o\u2022J!Jli:Aoxf,) \nof subject and predicate. Leibniz thus conceives of truth from the outset \u00ad\nexplicitly, though not entirely legitimately, appealing to Aristotle - as truth \nof assertion (proposition). He determines the nexus as the \"inesse\" of P in \nS, and the \"inesse\" as \"idem esse.\" Identity as the essence of propositional \ntruth here evidently does not mean the empty sameness of something with \nitself, but unity in the sense of the original unitary agreement of that which \nbelongs together. [27] Truth thus means a unitary accord [Einstimmigkeit], \nwhich for its part can be such only as an overarching accordance [ Vber\u00ad\neinstimmung] with whatever is announced as unitary in the identity.

That linking which \nis a taking apart within every truth in each case always is what it is on the \ngrounds of. . .  , that is, as self-\"grounding.\" In its very essence, truth thus \nhouses a relation to something like \"ground.\" In that case, however, the \nproblem of truth necessarily brings us into a \"proximity\" to the problem \nof ground. Therefore the more originarily we master the essence of truth, \nthe more pressing the problem of ground must become. \nHowever, can anything more originary be brought to bear beyond the \ndelimitation of the essence of truth as a characteristic of the assertion? \n102 \n"

In its first meaning mundus \nmeans as much as ens creatum.

What must be clarified is: (I) To what does the \ntotality represented under the title \"world\" relate, and to what alone can \nit relate? (2) What is accordingly represented in the concept of world? (3) \nWhat chorocter does this represmting of such totality have; i.e., what is the \nconceptual structure of the concept of world as such?

The substantive content \nrepresented a priori in these \"synthetic\" principles, their \"reality\" in the \nold meaning - precisely retained by Kant - of substantiveness, may be pre\u00ad\nsented free of experience and by way of intuition from out of the objects, \ni.e., from out of that which is necessarily intuited a priori along with such \nobjects, namely, the pure intuition of \"time.\" The reality of the synthetic \nI 16 \n"

      "full_text": "ON THE ESSENCE OF GROUND \nbringing world before itself is the originary projection of the possibilities \nof Dasein, insofar as, in the midst of beings, it is to be able to corupon itself \ntoward such beings. Yet just as it does not explicidy grasp that which has \nbeen projected, this projection of world [5 sl also always casts the projected \nworld over beings. This prior casting-over [ Ubn-wuifl first makes it possible \nfor beings as such to manifest themselves. This occurrence of a projective \ncasting-over, in which the being of Dasein is temporalized, is being-in-the\u00ad\nworld. \"Dasein transcends\" means: in the essence of its being it is world\u00ad\nforming, \"forming\" [bildend I in the multiple sense that it lets world occur, \nand through the world gives itself an original view (form [Bi/d)) that is not \nexplicidy grasped, yet functions precisely as a paradigmatic form [ Vor-bild I \nfor all manifest beings, among which each respective Dasein itself belongs. \nBeings, such as nature in the broadest sense, could in no way become \nmanifest unless they found occasi01 to enter into a world. This is why we \nspeak of their possible and occasional entry into world. Entry into world is not \nsome process that transpires in those beings that enter it, but is something \nthat \"happens\" \"with\" beings. And such occurrence is the existing of Dasein, \nwhich as existing transcends.a Only if, amid beings in their totality, beings \u00b7 \ncome to be \"more in being\" in the manner of the temporalizing of Dasein \nare there the hours and days of beings' entry into world. \nAnd only if \nthis primordial history, namely, transcendence, occurs, i.e., only if beings \nhaving the character of being-in-the-world irrupt into beings, is there the \npossibility of beings manifesting themselves.62 b \nOur elucidation of transcendence thus far already lets us understand \nthat, if it is indeed in transcendence alone that beings can come to light as \nbeings, transcendence comprises an excepti01al d071tlin for the elaboration \nof all questions that concern beings as such, i.e., in their being. Before we \ndissect our guiding problem of ground within the domain of transcendence, \nand thereby [56l sharpen the problem of transcendence in one particular \nrespect, we should become better acquainted with the transcendence of \nDasein via a further historical recollection. \na First edition, 1 919: But Dasein and heyng itself?
