I\u2019ve chosen \nto read this text, and I shall do so, because, let me recall brie\ufb02 y, you must \nhave noticed that the historical corpus, a particular historical corpus (this \nwas not premeditated on my part, it happened to me during preparation \nand at the beginning of the year, I didn\u2019t think that that was how it was \ngoing to be in December) imposed itself on us, on me, a historico- political \ncorpus that to a large extent has been that of a French sequence \u2014 and I \nwant to emphasize that we have had a French seminar (the sessions devoted \nto b\u00ea tise, to bestiality in Lacan and Deleuze, were French problems, the \nFrenchness of which had to be thought). Well, the historico- political corpus \non the question of the sovereign that imposed itself on us and in any case on \nme was, broadly speaking, that of a sequence that runs from the great age \nof French royalty, the \u201cGrand Si\u00e8cle,\u201d and a little before, up to the French \nRevolution, decapitation, the guillotine, the history of Capet, of Louis Ca-\npet, and, whether directly or through Celan\u2019s \u201cMeridian,\u201d it was always the \nquestion of the French Revolution that happened to the sovereign, to the \nabsolute sovereign, to absolute monarchy, in France, at the time of the Rev-\nolution, that concerned us, necessarily and inevitably. Well, the interesting \nthing about the text I\u2019m going to read to you is that it deals with the wolf \nfrom the point of view of French royalty \u2014 we spoke of the Dauphin, the \nDauphin and the wolf \u2014 and to link it to a concept, or in any case to a word, \nwhich is that of translation, translatio. It\u2019s from a book by Jean- Clet Martin, \nOssuaires: Anatomie du Moyen \u00c2ge roman that I\u2019d like to read to you \u2014 like \nthe last day of grade school, just before vacation, when we were children, \n451 \n"

But this plaint is also the sur-\nface on which the people begins to pullulate, of the legend that carves it \nup and feudalizes it to make a place for the Capetian king. The wolf, the \nking, the saint will then be incorporated [incorporation of the beast and \nthe sovereign] into a set- up in which each term will express a function \nthat the other feudalizes according to a new function. Feudality is here \nthe index of a multiple- subjection function, an assemblage that the name \n\u201cMarcwulf\u201d delimits and individualizes much better that the ceremony of \nthe consecration, unable to account for the process of subjectivation capable \nof inscribing the saint and the king, the king and the wolf into one and the \nsame heterotopic ethos.\n \nMarcwulf, the \u201cwolf of the marches\u201d [\u201cmarch\u201d in the sense of limit, or \nlimen, frontier], the processual wolf, designates this popular chimera that \nthe people constantly celebrates as the machination of its own consistency, \nan animal sent from the people like the leitmotiv of a social crystallography, \na motif capable of con\ufb01 guring the forces that traverse it and that relaunch \nthemselves as a multiform, thaumaturgical king [remember the thauma-\nturgical kings we mentioned when we were reading Marin, and in connec-\ntion with Kantorowicz\u2019s King\u2019s Two Bodies, preceded by Marc Bloch\u2019s book \nLes rois thaumaturges]. A king who, moreover, depends more on the saint \nand the wolf, to whom he will be like a vassal, than on the foundational \nconsecration conceived of as a sticking point, a blockage of dubbings. There \nis of course no doubt that the consecration, the ceremony of investiture, suc-\nceeded in the end in taking hold of the feudal machine to make it into that \nstate apparatus magni\ufb01 ed by Adalb\u00e9ron, a royalty allied to the pope and to \nthe reformed Church [this is of course a huge story . . . I\u2019m reading fast and \nyou\u2019d need to read the whole book]. But the fact that the confrontation of \nthe feudal machine be abolished in the mesh of power knotted vertically \naround a centralized state does not prevent that fact that there was a con-\nfrontation, a suspension of political singularities, in the passage from the \nCarolingians to the Capetian dynasty.7\nI\u2019ll \ufb01 nish my quotation here. You can see clearly that it\u2019s also about a con\ufb02 ict \nfor sovereignty between two dynasties, with the stake being the af\ufb01 rmation \nof a state sovereignty on the basis of feudal structures, a war between lords \nand king. I especially wanted to read you this text, not only because of the \nwolves and the Capetians and the Carolingians, but also because what\u2019s go-\ning on here is a translating operation, rhetorical, metonymical, a force that \ndisplaces names, and there too, in a sense, it\u2019s about logos.

This logocentrism of \nthe Abrahamic religions and of philosophy signifying not so much that the \nlogos was simply the center of everything, but that it was in a situation, \nprecisely, of sovereign hegemony, organizing everything on the basis of its \nforced translations.\nSo, on that basis, I suggest two things for the twenty minutes or so we \nhave left: \ufb01 rst to have a quick look at logos in Aristotle\u2019s Politics, in the fa-\nmous passage in which Aristotle de\ufb01 nes man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, and then, \nif we have time, a word about the Bible, with which I meant to start at the \nvery beginning.\nAs I was saying very quickly last time, it\u2019s the very beginning of book 1 \nof the Politics, that\u2019s where it starts, and Aristotle is de\ufb01 ning the polis, the \nstate as a sort of community (koino\u00afnia), which, as a community, is consti-\ntuted with a view to a certain good. The state is a community organized \nwith a view to a good, agathon. One might say that this agathon is naturally \nsought, as a good, by every community, even an animal community, but \nwhat  Aristotle announces from the start is that the state as human commu-\nnity, as human koino\u00afnia, is organized with a view to the good as sovereign \ngood;8 this is the standard translation, and of course the word translated as \nsovereign is, as you\u2019ll remember from when we were talking about Bodin, \nthe word that is most often used in Greek to designate sovereignty, kurios:\n. . . it is obvious that all aim at a certain good and that precisely the sover-\neign good [kurio\u00aftatou, the sovereign good, the supreme good] among all \ngoods is the end of the community that is sovereign [kurio\u00aftate\u00af] among all \n[the community is basically sovereign over all, and so the notion of sov-\nereignty is de\ufb01 ned here, from the start, inscribed into the very concept of \nstate, polis, and community] and includes all the others: the one called the \nCity or the political community [e koino\u00afnia e politike\u00af].

You re-\nmember Agamben\u2019s interpretation that we discussed, Heidegger\u2019s interpre-\ntation that puts into question this very de\ufb01 nition of man as zo\u00afon legon ekhon, \nwhich he says is unworthy of the humanity of man, not only in that it is a \n\u201czoological\u201d de\ufb01 nition, says Heidegger, not only because one attributes the \nlogos to this zo\u00afon, but because one surreptitiously neglects an interpretation \nof the logos that is itself already contestable according to Heidegger.

And thus \n(we\u2019ll return to this) his critique, if you like, of zo\u00afon logon ekhon, the animal \nrationale, concerns not only the de\ufb01 nition of man in his relation to logos, but \nalso the de\ufb01 nition of the political: man as political animal is indissociable \nfrom the de\ufb01 nition of man as having the logos, logon ekhon.\nSo here is Aristotle\u2019s text:\nFrom these considerations it is clear that the City is a natural reality and \nthat man is naturally a being destined to live in a City [political animal, to\u00afn \nphusei e polis esti, kai oti antho\u00afpos phusei politikon zo\u00afon: is a political animal]; \nhe who is cityless is, by nature and not by chance, a being either degraded \nor else superior to man [the one who is without a City, who is apolis, who \nis apolitical, is either below or else above man, either an animal or else god: \nthe political is properly human, what in life is properly human: \u201che who \nis cityless (kai o apolis dia phusin kai ou dia tukhe\u00afn, etc.), is, by nature and \nnot by chance, either below or else above man\u201d]: he is like the man Homer \nreproaches with having \u201cno clan, no law, no hearth\u201d; a man this way by \nnature is by the same token warlike; he is like an isolated pawn in chess. \nAnd so the reason is clear why man is a political being more than any others, \nbees or gregarious animals. As we maintain, indeed, nature does nothing in \nvain; now alone among animals man has speech [logon de\u00af monon anthro\u00afpos \nekhei to\u00afn zo\u00afon: so, there is an essential link between politicity and the dispo-\nsition to the logos, they are indissociable.] No doubt the sounds of the voice \n[phone\u00af] express pain and pleasure, and so they are found in all animals: their \nnature allows them only to feel pain and pleasure and to manifest them \namong themselves [so phone\u00af does not suf\ufb01 ce to de\ufb01 ne logos].14\n(When I distinguished \u2014 a very long time ago \u2014 between logocentrism and \nphonocentrism,15 it was precisely to mark the fact that logocentrism, by ref-\nerence to this signi\ufb01 er, this vocable, logos, which is proper to the historico-\n cultural zone I was de\ufb01 ning a moment ago (Abrahamic, evangelical reli-\n14.

This is, indeed, the distinctive character of mankind compared to all \nthe other animals: [pros talla zo\u00afa tois anthro\u00afpois idion: what is proper (idion) \nto man faced with (or in the eyes of) all the other living beings] he alone \nperceives good and evil, the just and the unjust [to monon agathou kai kakou \nkai dikaiou kai adikou], and the other values [kai te\u00afn allo\u00afn aisthe\u00afsin]; now it is \nthe common possession of these values that makes family and city.16\nWhich obviously leaves entire the question that we were raising last time, \nthat of knowing whether, in saying this, Aristotle \u2014 how should we put \nit? \u2014 was already sensitive, accessible, open or not to what, in a certain \nFrench modality, is called \u201cbiopolitics.\u201d You remember the distinction \n Agam ben was trying to make, which seemed to me untenable, between \nthe de\ufb01 nition of the zo\u00afon politikon as essential attribute or as speci\ufb01 c differ-\nence. But precisely, what Aristotle says \u2014 and this is where this distinction \nbetween the two attributions does not work \u2014 is that man is that living be-\ning who is taken by politics: he is a political living being, and essentially so. \nIn other words, he is zoo- political, that\u2019s his essential de\ufb01 nition, that\u2019s what \n16. Aristotle, Politics, 1253a 10\u201318.\n \n462\n"
