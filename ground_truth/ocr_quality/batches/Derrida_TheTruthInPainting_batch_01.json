This position is uncomfortable because it is \nfalse: in fact the translator's attitude to the reader is profoundly \nambivalent, and this ambivalence can only be increased when \ns/he has learned from the author to be translated that the task is \nstrictly speaking an impossible one. The absolutely generous proj\u00ad\nect of giving Derrida's meaning to be read would rapidly produce \nthe absolutely ungenerous result of leaving the text in French, \nleaving ourselves a certain amount of self-congratulation on being \nable at least to begin to read it that way, and slyly affecting com\u00ad\nmiseration for those unable to do so. The classical ideal of self\u00ad\neffacing, respectful, and charitable translation is in fact the death \nof translation. \nYet Derrida's work undeniably calls for translation, but for \ntranslation as transformation: that transformation affects both \nlanguages at work-our English is transformed as is Derrida's \nFrench. As Derrida notes, however, such a transformation must \nbe regulated jthough not, we would add, by the principle of charity \nfor the reader): yet no single rule is sufficient for that regulation, \nand least of all the rule that our aim should be to reproduce in \nthe English or American reader the same \"effect\" that Derrida's \nFrench produces on the French.

Refusing any such rule implies the adoption \nof flexible strategies, including those of supplying some of the \nFrench text, adding some explanatory footnotes, sometimes being \nguided almost exclusively by the signifier, as in parts of \" +  R\" \nand in the subtitle of \"Restitutions.\" \nThe problems facing the translator are at their greatest in the \ncase of idiom (The Truth in Painting is also \"about\" the idiom \n[in painting]): pure idiom is the untranslatable itself. Here the \nbest we can hope is that the reader might learn some French-it \nwas a guiding fantasy of our work (a fantasy which remained just \nthat) that by the end of the book the reader would have learned \nFrench and that our translation would thus have made itself un\u00ad\nnecessary, although not self-effacing. No translation could be self\u00ad\neffacing before the mise en boite of \"Cartouches\" or the revenir \nand rendre of \"Restitutions.\" Not that these are pure idioms: but \nin Derrida's work of reliteralization and etymologization of such \nexamples, the idiom becomes disseminated throughout the whole \nof French (and therefore several other languages too). This type \nof strategy completes the translators' discomfiture, in that it dis\u00ad\npossesses of mastery even the claim to have read La Verite en \npeinture. \nIt may seem paradoxical that in this situation we should claim \nthe need for accuracy and rigor: but rigor here needs to be re\u00ad\nthought in terms of flexibility and compromise, just as, in \"Res\u00ad\ntitutions,\" stricture has also to be thought in terms of destric\u00ad\nturation. The \"compromise English\" in which this translation is \nwritten is inevitable and should stand in no need of excuse, if \nonly because the supplement is never simply a substitute. \"Com\u00ad\npromise English\" also recognizes that the supplement is never \nfinal or definitive: this version is therefore also a call for retransla\u00ad\ntion and modification. \nGeoff Bennington \nIan McLeod \n"

If we are to understand \nCezanne's sentence, the truth (presentation or representation, un\u00ad\nveiling or adequation) must be rendered \"in painting\" either by \npresentation or by representation, according to the two models \nof truth. Truth, the painter's model, must be rendered in painting \naccording to the two models of truth. Henceforth, the abyssal \nexpression \"truth of the truth,\" which will have made it be said \nthat the truth is the nontruth, can be crossed with itself according \nto all sort of chiasmi, according as one determines the model as \npresentation or as representation. Presentation of the represen\u00ad\ntation, presentation of the presentation, representation of the rep\u00ad\nresentation, representation of the presentation. Have I counted \nthem correctly? That makes at least fc'lI possibilities. \n3 .  That which pertains to the picturality, in the \"proper\" \nsense, of the presentation or of the representation. Truth could \nbe presented or represented quite otherwise, according to other \nmodes. Here it is done in painting: and not in discourse (as is \ncommonly the case), in literature, poetry, theater; nor is it done \nin the time of music or in other spaces (architecture or sculpture). \nThus we retain here that which is proper to an art, the art of the \nsignatory, of Cezanne the painter. That which is proper to an art \nand an art understood in the proper sense this time, in the expres\u00ad\nsion \"in painting.\" We did not do this in the two previous cases: \n\"painting\" was there to figure the presentation or representation \nof a model, which happened to be the truth. But this troping \nfiguration was valid for the logic of any other art of presentation \nor representation. In the French language, if there is one that is \none and if it is not a painting, \"the truth in painting\" could mean \nand be understood as: the truth, as shown, presented or repre\u00ad\nsented in the field of the pictural properly speaking, in the pic\u00ad\ntural, properly pictural mode, even if this mode is tropological \nwith respect to truth itself. To understand the expression \"truth \nin painting\" in this way, no doubt one has to move away a little \nfrom the greater force of usage (assuming that there are any rig\u00ad\norous criteria for evaluating it), while nevertheless maintaining \ngrammatical and syntactical and even semantic normality. But \nthat's what an idiom is, if there is any such thing. It does not \nmerely fix the economic propriety of a \"focus,\" but regulates the \npossibility of play, of divergences, of the equivocal-a whole econ\u00ad\nomy, precisely, of the trait. This economy parasitizes itself. \n"

That which pertains to truth in the order of painting, then, \nand on the subject of painting, not only as regards the pictorial \npresentation or representation of truth. The parasitizing of the \nexpression \"in painting\" by itself allows it to harbor a new sense: \nthe truth as regards painting, that which is true on that art which \nis called pictural. If one now defines that art by its truth-value, \nin one sense or the other, one will understand here the true on \nthe true. In the French language, if there is one that is one and \nwhich is not painting, and if nonetheless it can open its system \nup to its own parasitism, \"the truth in painting\" can mean and \nbe understood as: truth in the domain of painting and on the \nsubject of it, in painting, as in the saying \"to be knowledgeable \nin painting.\" l owe you the truth on painting and I will tell it to \nyou, and as painting ought to be the truth, l owe you the truth \nabout the truth and I will tell it to you. In letting itself be par\u00ad\nasitized, the system of language as a system of the idiom has \nperhaps parasitized the system of painting; more precisely, it will \nhave shown up, by analogy, the essential parasitizing which opens \nevery system to its outside and divides the unity of the line [trait] \nwhich purports to mark its edges. This partition of the edge is \nperhaps what is inscribed and occurs everywhere [se passe partout] \nin this book; and the protocol-frame is endlessly multiplied in it, \nfrom lemmata to parerga, from exergues to cartouches. Starting \nwith the idiom of the passe-partout. One is always tempted by \nthis faith in the idiom: it supposedly says only one thing, properly \nspeaking, and says it only in linking form and meaning too strictly \nto lend itself to translation. But if the idiom were this, were it \nwhat it is thought it must be, it would not be that, but it would \nlose all strength and would not make a language. It would be \ndeprived of that which in it plays with truth-effects. If the phrase \n\"the truth in painting\" has the force of \"truth\" and in its play \nopens onto the abyss, then perhaps what is at stake in painting \nis truth, and in truth what is at stake (that idiom) is the abyss. \nCezanne's trait is easily freed from an immediate context. Is \nit even necessary to know that it was signed by a painter? Its \nforce even depends on this capacity to play with the determina\u00ad\ntions of the context without making itself indeterminate. No \ndoubt the trait acts as a passe-partout. It circulates very quickly \namong its possibilities. With disconcerting agility it displaces its \naccents or its hidden punctuation, it potentializes and formalizes \nand economizes on enormous discourses, it multiplies the deal-\n"

Traditionally, a course begins by the semantic anal\u00ad\nysis of its title, of the word or concept which entitles it and which \ncan legitimate its discourse only by receiving its own legitimation \nfrom that discourse. Thus one would begin by asking oneself: \nWhat is art? Then: Where does it come from? What is the origin \nof art? This assumes that we reach agreement about what we \nunderstand by the word art. Hence: What is the origin of the \nmeaning of \"art\"? For these questions, the guiding thread (but it \nis precisely toward the notion of the thread and the interlacing \nthat I should like to lead you, from afar) will always have been \nthe existence of \"works,\" of \"works of art.\" Hegel says so at the \nbeginning of the Lectures on Aesthetics: we have before us but a \nsingle representation, namely, that there are works of art. This \nrepresentation can furnish us with an appropriate point of depar\u00ad\nture. So the question then becomes: What is \"the origin of the \nwork of art\"? And it is not without significance that this question \ngives its title to one of the last great discourses on art, that of \nHeidegger. \nThis protocol of the question installs us in a fundamental \npresupposition, and massively predetermines the system and \ncombinatory possibilities of answers. What it begins by implying \nis that art-the word, the concept, the thing-has a unity and, \nwhat is more, an originary meaning, an etymon, a truth that is \none and naked rune verite une et nue], and that it would be \nsufficient to unveil it through history. It implies first of all that \n\"art\" can be reached following the three ways of word, concept, \nand thing, or again of signifier, signified, and referent, or even by \nsome opposition between presence and representation. \nThrough history: the crossing can in this case just as well \ndenote historicism, the determining character of the historicity \nof meaning, as it can denote ahistoricity, history crossed, trans\u00ad\nfixed in the direction of meaning, in the sense of a meaning [le \nsens d'un sens] in itself ahistorical.

Better, that its \nhistory is not a history or that it is one history only in that it is \ngoverned by this one and naked meaning, under the regime of its \ninternal meaning, as history of the meaning of art.

Retracing its steps, in a circle. But art forms \nonly one of the circles in the great circle of the Geist or the \nrevenant (this visitor can be called Gast, or ghost, guest or \nGespenstJ. The end of art, and its truth, is religion, that other \ncircle of which the end, the truth, will have been philosophy, \nand so on. And you know-we shall have to get the most out \nof this later on-the function of the ternary rhythm in this \ncirculation. The fact remains that here art is studied from the \npoint of view of its end. Its pastness is its truth. The philosophy \nof art is thus a circle in a circle of circles: a \"ring\" says Hegel, \nin the totality of philosophy. It turns upon itself and in annulling \nitself it links onto other rings. This annular concatenation forms \nthe circle of circles of the philosophical encyclopedia. Art cuts \nout a circumscription or takes away a circumvolution from it. \nIt encircles itself \n"

      "full_text": "The Truth in Painting \nway, Hegel has to have recourse, certainly, to the metaphor of the \ncircle and of the circle of circles which he says, moreover, is only \na representation. But also to the metaphor of the organic whole. \nOnly philosophy in its entirety (gesammte Philosophie) gives us \nknowledge of the universe as a unique organic totality in itself, \nwhich develops \"from its own concept.\" Without losing anything \nof what makes it a whole \"which returns to itself,\" this \"sole \nworld of truth\" is contained, retained, and gathered together in \nitself. In the \"circlet\" of this scientific necessity, each part rep\u00ad\nresents a \"circle returning into itself\" and keeping a tie of soli\u00ad\ndarity with the others, a necessary and simultaneous interlacing. \nIt is animated by a \"backward movement\" (ein Riickwiirts) and \nby a \"forward movement\" ( Vorwiirts) by which it develops and \nreproduces itself in another in a fecund way (fruchtbar). Thus it \nis that, for us, the concept of the beautiful and of art is \"a pre\u00ad\nsupposition given by the system of philosophy./I Philosophy alone \ncan pose the question \"What is the beautiful?\" and answer it: the \nbeautiful is a production of art, i.e., of the mind. The idea of beauty \nis given to us by art, that circle inside the circle of the mind and \nof the philosophical encyclopedia, etc. \nBefore beginning to speak of the beautiful and of the fine arts, \none ought therefore, by right, to develop the whole of the Ency\u00ad\nclopedia and the Greater Logic. But since it is necessary, in fact, \nto begin \"lemmatically, so to speak\" (sozusagen lemmatisch) by \nanticipation or precipitation of the circlet, Hegel recognizes that \nhis point of departure is vulgar, and its philosophical justification \ninsufficient. He will have begun by the \"representation\" ( Vor\u00ad\nstellung) of art and of the beautiful for the \"common conscious\u00ad\nness\" (im gewohnlichen Bewusstsein). The price to be paid may \nseem very heavy: it will be said for example that the whole aes\u00ad\nthetics develops, explicates, and lays out the representations of \nnaIve consciousness. But does not this negative cancel itself at \nonce? On the immediately following page, Hegel explains that on \na circle of circles, one is justified in starting from any point. \n\"There is no absolute beginning in science.\" \nThe chosen point of departure, in everyday representation: \nthere are works of art, we have them in front of us in represen\u00ad\ntation ( Vorstellung). But how are they to be recognized? This is \nnot an abstract and juridical question. At each step, at each ex\u00ad\nample, in the absence of enormous theoretical, juridical, political, \netc. protocols, there is a trembling of the limit between the \"there \nis\" and the \"there is not\" \"work of art,\" between a \"thing\" and \n"

The Origin of the Work of Art will have taken a running \nstart for an incommensurable leap. Certainly, and here are some \ndry indications of it, pending a more patient reading. \n1 .  All the oppositions which support the metaphysics of art \nfind themselves questioned, in particular that of form and matter, \nwith all its derivatives. This is done in the course of a questioning \non the being-work of the work and the being-thing of a thing in \nall the determinations of the thing that more or less implicitly \nsupport any philosophy of art (hypokeimenon, aistheton, hyle). \n2 .  As the Post/ace indicates, it is from the possibility of its \ndeath that art can here be interrogated. It is possible that art is \nin its death throes, but \"it will take a good few centuries\" until \nit dies and is mourned (Heidegger does not mention mourning). \nThe Origin is situated in the zone of resonance of Hegel's Lectures \non Aesthetics in as much as they think of art as a \"past\": \"In the \nmost comprehensive (umfassendsten) meditation which the West \npossesses on the essence of art-comprehensive because thought \nout from metaphysics-in Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics, stands \nthe following proposition: 'But we no longer have an absolute \nneed to bring a content to presentation (zur Darstellung) in the \nform of art. Art, from the aspect of its highest destination, is for \nus something past (ein Vergangenes).' \" After recalling that it would \nbe laughable to elude this proposition under the pretext that works \nhave survived this verdict-a possibility which, one can be sure, \ndid not escape its author-Heidegger continues: \"But the question \nremains: is art still, or is it no longer, an essential and necessary \nmode ( Weise) according to which the decisive [deciding] truth \n"
