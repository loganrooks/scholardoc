From early in his career, in 1968, and annually thereafter un-\ntil 2003, Derrida regularly taught at U.S. universities. It was his custom to \nrepeat for his American audience the lectures delivered to his students in \nFrance the same year. Teaching \ufb01 rst at Johns Hopkins and then at Yale, \nhe read the lectures in French as they had been written. But from 1987, \nwhen he began teaching at the University of California, Irvine, Derrida \nundertook to lecture in En glish, improvising on-the-spot translations of his \nFrench text. Recognizing that the greater part of his audience outside of \nFrance depended on translation was easier, however, than providing an ad \nlibitum En glish version of his own elegant, complex, and idiomatic writ-\ning. In the circumstance, to his evident joy in teaching was often added a \nmeasure of suffering and regret for all that remained behind in the French \noriginal. It is to the memory of Derrida the teacher as well as to all his stu-\ndents past and still to come that we offer these En glish translations of \u201cThe \nSeminars of Jacques Derrida.\u201d\nThe volumes in this series are translations of the original French editions \npublished by \u00c9ditions Galil\u00e9e, Paris, and will in each case follow shortly the \npublication of the corresponding French volume. The scope of the project, \nand the basic editorial principles followed in establishing the text, are out-\nlined in the \u201cGeneral Introduction to the French Edition,\u201d translated here. \nEditorial issues and decisions relating more speci\ufb01 cally to this volume are \naddressed in an \u201cEditorial Note.\u201d Editors\u2019 footnotes and other editorial inter-\nventions are, with a few exceptions, translated without modi\ufb01 cation, ex cept \nin the case of footnoted citations of quoted material, which refer to extant \nEn glish translations of the source as necessary.

Fi-\nnally \u2014 and, no doubt, most relevantly for the editorial work \u2014 according \nto the tools used: we have handwritten sessions from 1960 to 1970; type-\nscripts, with manuscript annotations and corrections, from 1970 to 1988; \nelectronic \ufb01 les and printouts from 1988 to 2003.\nDerrida\u2019s seminars, which already had their own style and had already \n attracted a broad and numerous following at the rue d\u2019Ulm (where the \nchoice of subjects and authors, if not the way they were treated, was con-\nstrained by the program of the Agr\u00e9gation),2 take on their de\ufb01 nitive char-\nacter at the EHESS, where, on Wednesdays from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm, a \ndozen times a year, Jacques Derrida, sometimes improvising a little, would \nread before a large audience the text of his seminar, entirely written out for \neach session as the year proceeded. (Add to that a few improvised sessions, \nsometimes around a reading, and a few discussion sessions.) Henceforth \nfree in his choice of subjects, Derrida launched research projects over peri-\nods of several years, which link together in explicit, coherent, and gripping \nfashion. The great question of philosophical nationality and nationalism \n(1984\u201388) leads to that of the \u201cPolitics of Friendship\u201d (1988\u201391), and then to \nthe long series of \u201cQuestions of Responsibility\u201d (1991\u2013 2003), focusing suc-\ncessively on the Secret (1991\u201392), on Testimony (1992\u201395), Hostility and \nHospitality (1995\u201397), Perjury and Pardon (1997\u201399), and the Death Pen-\nalty (1999\u20132001), with the \ufb01 nal two years devoted to \u201cThe Beast and the \nSovereign\u201d (2001\u20133).\nJacques Derrida was in the habit of drawing on the abundant mate-\nrial of these seminars for the very numerous lectures he gave every year \nthroughout the world, and often, via this route, parts of the seminars were \nreworked and published. Several of his books also \ufb01 nd their point of de-\nparture in the work of the seminar: Of Grammatology (1967), for example, \nin large part develops sessions of the 1965\u201366 seminar on \u201cNature, Culture, \nWriting\u201d; the seminar on \u201cHegel\u2019s Family\u201d (1971\u201372) is picked up in Glas \n(1974). Politics of Friendship (1994) is explicitly presented as the expansion of \nthe \ufb01 rst session of the 1988\u201389 seminar, and there are traces in it of other \nsessions too. But in spite of these partial convergences and correspondences, \nin En glish: Derrida would improvise during the session an En glish version of his text, \nwhich he had previously annotated for this purpose. \n2.

Rather than \nattempt what could only be a reductive summary, we reproduce here the \npresentation given by Derrida in the \u00c9cole\u2019s yearbook:\nWe pursued the research that in previous years, centering on the prob-\nlem of the death penalty, had led us to study sovereignty, the political and \nontotheological history of its concept and its \ufb01 gures. This year we delib-\nerately privileged what intertwined this history with that of a thinking \nof the living being (the biological and the zoological), and more precisely \nwith the treatment of so- called animal life in all its registers (hunting and \ndomestication, political history of zoological parks and gardens, breeding, \nindustrial and experimental exploitation of the living animal, \ufb01 gures of \nbestiality and b\u00eatise, etc.). The point was not merely to study, from Aristo-\ntle to contemporary discussions (Foucault, Agamben), the canonical texts \naround the interpretation of man as a \u201cpolitical animal.\u201d We had above all \nto explore the \u201clogics\u201d organizing both the submission of the beast (and \nthe living being) to political sovereignty, and an irresistible and overloaded \nanalogy between a beast and a sovereign supposed to share a space of some \nexteriority with respect to \u201claw\u201d and \u201cright\u201d (outside the law: above the law: \norigin and foundation of the law).\n \nWe studied a great many philosophical, rhetorical, political, and other \nindices of this overdetermined analogy (La Fontaine\u2019s Fables and the tradi-\ntion that precedes and follows them, texts by Machiavelli, Schmitt, etc.). We \nalso attempted a sort of taxonomy of the animal \ufb01 gures of the political, no-\ntably from the point of view of sovereignty (always outside the law: above \nthe laws). Alongside the lion, the fox, etc., the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the wolf (in \nmany cultures) and often the \u201cwerewolf\u201d (in Europe) interested us a great \ndeal, from Plautus to Hobbes and Rousseau.\n \nOn the permanent horizon of our work were general questions about \ne d i t o r i a l  n o t e\n14\n"

Also, Derrida often left time for discussion with seminar participants. \nWe have signaled such moments in the sessions, but we also decided not to \ninclude these discussions, which, although they were recorded (but often in \na technically de\ufb01 cient manner, with some voices being inaudible and above \nall dif\ufb01 cult to identify), seemed to us to raise too many questions. In this we \nhave followed what was most usually done at the Cerisy and other major \nconferences devoted to Derrida\u2019s work.\nIn the typescript of the seminar, the bibliographical indications were, \nmost often, clearly indicated but in abbreviated form: we have completed \nthem and \ufb01 lled in those that were missing. A number of quotations were \nnot copied out in the typescript: they were included as photocopies of pages \nfrom books, and we have reinserted them, where necessary resorting to the \ntape recording of the sessions to be sure of where to begin and end. Else-\nwhere, we used Jacques Derrida\u2019s own books, whenever it was possible to \n\ufb01 nd them in the library of his house at Ris- Orangis. In doubtful cases or \nwhere it was impossible to track down the copy he would have used, we \nhave referred to the editions that are generally thought to be the most reli-\nable. We have checked and where necessary corrected the quotations made \nby Jacques Derrida, rectifying without signaling the fact whatever seemed \nto be obvious errors of transcription; but we have signaled, when they \nmight be signi\ufb01 cant, certain modi\ufb01 cations to quotations or translations. Fi-\nnally, to end on this question of references: Jacques Derrida makes numer-\nous references throughout the seminar to his own earlier work, whether \npublished or not: we give references whenever the citation is explicit, even \nwhen the work cited belongs to the still unpublished body of the seminars \nthemselves.7\nAs for the more technical aspects of our work, they are relatively slight. \nThis edition is of the entire text of Derrida\u2019s 2001\u20132 seminar as it was com-\nposed and laid out by him, notably as to its sometimes very long sentences \nand paragraphs. Similarly, at a more micrographic level, the punctuation \nhas been preserved; in particular all the brackets, which are Derrida\u2019s own.8 \nWe have, however, on rare occasions made some corrections or minute al-\n7.

La, le.\nNaturally I shall try to justify this title as I go along, step by step, perhaps \nstealthily, like a wolf [peut- \u00eatre \u00e0 pas de loup]. Those of you who followed the \nlast few years\u2019 seminars on the death penalty know that the huge and for-\nmidable question of sovereignty was central to them. So this inexhaustible \nquestion will provide for a certain continuity between the previous semi-\nnars and what still remains untrodden from this new approach, by the turn \nor at the turning of the seminar to come.\nThe question of the animal was also, here and elsewhere, one of our \npermanent concerns. But the beast is not exactly the animal, and it was only \nafter the fact, after having chosen this title, the literal formulation of this \ntitle, the [feminine] beast and the [masculine] sovereign, that I understood \n1. This session was published, almost in its entirety, in the proceedings of the 2002 \nCerisy conference, La d\u00e9mocratie \u00e0 venir, ed. Marie-Louise Mallet (Paris: Galil\u00e9e, 2004), \npp. 433\u201356.

It is looming, an object of apprehension; it is named, re-\nferred to, even called by its name; one imagines it or projects toward it an \nimage, a trope, a \ufb01 gure, a myth, a fable, a fantasy, but always by reference to \nsomeone who, advancing \u00e0 pas de loup, is not there, not yet there, someone \nwho is not yet present or represented; you can\u2019t even see its tail; as another \nproverb says: \u201cWhen you speak of the wolf, you see its tail,\u201d meaning that \nsomeone, a human this time, shows up just when you are talking about him \nor her.

An adverb haunts a noun. The adverb pas has \nslipped in silently, stealthy as a wolf, \u00e0 pas de loup, into the noun pas [step].\nWhich is to say that where things are looming \u00e0 pas de loup, the wolf is \nnot there yet, no real wolf, no so- called natural wolf, no literal wolf. There \nis no wolf yet when things are looming \u00e0 pas de loup. There is only a word, a \nspoken word, a fable, a  fable- wolf, a fabulous animal, or even a fantasy (fan-\ntasma in the sense of a revenant, in Greek; or fantasy in the enigmatic sense \nof psychoanalysis, in the sense, for example, that a totem corresponds to a \nfantasy); there is only another \u201cwolf\u201d that \ufb01 gures something else \u2014 some-\nthing or somebody else, the other that the fabulous \ufb01 gure of the wolf, like \n8.

Although the path \nwe\u2019re going down is not exactly the same, we\u2019ll often be crossing this anal-\nysis of Marin\u2019s, which I therefore strongly recommend that you read. One \nof the many interesting things about Marin\u2019s approach is that it proposes a \nhistorical articulation between several exactly contemporary texts: this fable \nof La Fontaine\u2019s, then the Port- Royal General Grammar and Art of Think-\ning, and \ufb01 nally a famous Pens\u00e9e of Pascal\u2019s on the relation between justice \nand force, a Pens\u00e9e to which Marin often returned, and the logic of which \nis very important to us here. I\u2019m referring to what Pascal places under the \ntitle \u201cReason of effects,\u201d and I\u2019ll read the whole fragment, even though we\u2019ll \nhave to come back to it in more detail later, because interpreting it requires \nwhole  treasure- houses of attention and vigilance (298 in Brunschvicg\u2019s clas-\nsi\ufb01 cation, 103 in Lafuma\u2019s):\nJustice, force. It is just that what is just be followed; it is necessary that what \nis strongest be followed. Justice without force is impotent; force without \njustice is tyrannical. Justice without force is contradicted, because there are \nalways bad people; force without justice stands accused. So justice and force \nmust be put together; and to do so make what is just, strong and what is \nstrong, just.\n \nJustice is subject to dispute; force is easy to recognize and indisputable. \nAnd so one could not give force to justice, because force contradicted justice \nand said that it was unjust, and said that it was force that was just. And \nthus not being able to make what is just, strong; one made what is strong, \njust.12\nApart from Marin\u2019s, I refer you, among the texts that are one way or \nan other devoted to this fragment, to my little book Force de loi13 and the \nremarkable chapter that Geoffrey Bennington devotes to Paul de Man in \nLegislations: The Politics of Deconstruction.14\n11.

Taking up the thread \nof the quotation again:]\nThe reasoning of this Caligula comes down to the same thing as in Hobbes \nand Grotius. Aristotle, before any of them, had also said that men are not \nnaturally equal, but that some were born for slavery and others for domi-\nnation.\n \nAristotle was right [avait raison: reason again! This time in the syntagm \n\u201cavoir raison\u201d the point is not to avoir raison de but just to avoir raison, to \nbe just or right]; but he took the effect for the cause. Any man born into \nslavery is born for slavery, nothing is more certain. Slaves lose everything in \ntheir irons, even the desire to be free of them; they love their enslavement \nas Odysseus\u2019s companions loved their brutishness. So if there are slaves by \nnature, this is because there have been slaves against nature. Force made the \n\ufb01 rst slaves.19\nRousseau\u2019s thesis is thus both that \u201cthe reason of the strongest\u201d is in fact the \nbest, that it has prevailed and prevails in fact (the stronger has reason of the \nweaker, the wolf of the lamb), but that if in fact the reason of the stronger \nwins out, by right the reason of the strongest is not the best, ought not to be, \nought not to have been the best, ought not to have been right, and every-\nthing will turn around the semantic pivot of the word \u201creason\u201d in the fable: \nwhen the fable says \u201cthe reason of the strongest is always the best,\u201d is it rea-\nson itself, the good reason, the most just reason, true reason, or the reason \ngiven, alleged by the stronger (Caligula or the sovereign or the wolf in the \nfable) which is the best? And \u201cbest\u201d can still mean two radically hetero -\n19. Ibid., p. 237.

And is the complex, al-\nthough relatively short, history of the concept of sovereignty in the West (a \nconcept that is itself an institution that we shall try to study as well as we \ncan) the history of a law, or is it not, the structure of which is or is not, also \nto be found in the laws that organize the hierarchized relations of authority, \nhegemony, force, power, power of life and death in so- called animal socie-\nties? The question is all the more obscure and necessary for the fact that the \nminimal feature that must be recognized in the position of sovereignty, at \nthis scarcely even preliminary stage, is, as we insisted these last few years \nwith respect to Schmitt,21 a certain power to give, to make, but also to suspend \nthe law; it is the exceptional right to place oneself above right, the right to \nnon- right,22 if I can say this, which both runs the risk of carrying the human \nsovereign above the human, toward divine omnipotence (which will more-\nover most often have grounded the principle of sovereignty in its sacred and \n21.

For the current representation, to which \nwe are referring for a start, sovereign and beast seem to have in common \ntheir  being- outside- the- law. It is as though both of them were situated by \nde\ufb01 nition at a distance from or above the laws, in nonrespect for the abso-\nlute law, the absolute law that they make or that they are but that they do \nnot have to respect.

Cer-\ntainly, Chomsky has no indulgence for Saddam Hussein or for Iraq, which \nhe describes, relying on a number of well- known facts, as a \u201cleading crimi-\nnal state\u201d (p. 24, read all the pages around this). But if Saddam\u2019s Iraq indeed \ncomes in at the top of the list of criminal states, if, as US diplomacy has been \nreminding us regularly for ten years, Saddam is guilty of using weapons of \nmass destruction against his neighbors and his own people, Chomsky has no \ndif\ufb01 culty recalling that for a very long time Saddam was well treated by the \nUSA, as an ally and a client. This treatment only came to an end, leading to \na terrible biological war whose Iraqi victims are counted by the thousands \n(malnutrition, illness, \ufb01 ve thousand children dying every month accord-\ning to unicef quoted by Chomsky, etc.) \u2014 this treatment of Saddam as \nrespected ally and client only came to an end, then, when Saddam stopped \nfollowing the political and  militaro- economic strategy of the USA (and one \ncould say the same about the Taliban). Only at that moment did Iraq, ceas-\ning to be an ally, an accomplice, or a docile client, become a rogue state and \nonly then did one begin to speak of Saddam Hussein, the leader of a rogue \nstate, as a beast, \u201cthe beast of Baghdad.\u201d29 I make this remark to announce \nthe fact that we will no doubt be talking a lot, later in this seminar, about \nwhat has become known as \u201cSeptember 11.\u201d\nThat, said too brie\ufb02 y and in pure anticipation, is the obscure place to-\nward which we are directed by the word, itself obscure, \u201canalogy,\u201d analogy \nbetween the political sovereign and the beast. This word analogy is not only \nobscure, like a word whose concept or theorem, whose theoretical tenor, is \ninvisible or inaccessible: it is obscure and dark and black, this word analogy, \nlike the reality of a frightening cloud that announces and carries within \nit the threat of thunder, of lightning, of tempest and hurricane; it is dark \nbecause it is heavy with all the (actual and virtual) violences and nameless \nhistorical ravages, disasters we won\u2019t (already don\u2019t) have a name for, when \nthe names of right (national or international), war, civil war or international \nwar, terrorism (national or international) lose their most elementary credit.\n2. The second reason why I quote these \ufb01 rst chapters of the Social Con-\ntract is that we already see cited in them philosophers and philosophemes, \npolitical philosophies, that ought to occupy us as a \ufb01 rst priority: for example, \nas you heard, Aristotle, Grotius, and Hobbes. Rousseau here inscribes all \nthree of them rather quickly into the same tradition, neglecting the massive \nfact that it was in order to break with Aristotle, and with the consequences \n29.

Naturally we shall have to read or reread these texts.\n3. The third reason why I refer to these \ufb01 rst chapters of the Social Con-\ntract is that in the lines I have just quoted, Rousseau adds a footnote to the \nword \u201cbrutishness\u201d [abrutissement] (\u201cthey love their enslavement as Odys-\nseus\u2019s companions loved their brutishness\u201d). The note refers to Plutarch. It \nsays, \u201cSee a little treatise by Plutarch, entitled: That Beasts Have Reason.\u201d \nYou will \ufb01 nd this fascinating text by Plutarch [Bruta Animalia ratione uti], \ntranslated [into French] by Amyot, in the collection published and pref-\naced by \u00c9lisabeth de Fontenay, Trois trait\u00e9s pour les animaux.30 The treatise \nto which Rousseau refers is found there under the title \u201cThat brute beasts \nuse reason.\u201d The word \u201cbrute\u201d will often be very important to us, where it \nseems to connote not only animality but a certain bestiality of the animal. \nI cannot recommend too strongly that you read these texts, which could \ndetain us for a long time. In \u201cThat brute beasts use reason,\u201d the \ufb01 rst words \nof a philosophical discussion with several voices already or again convoke \nthe \ufb01 gure of the wolf, the analogy and the quasi- metamorphosis that or-\nganizes the passage between man and wolf (but also lion). The discussion \nbegins, then, with this metamorphic analogy: \u201cI think I\u2019ve understood what \nyou\u2019re saying, Circe, and I\u2019ll bear it in mind. But please could you tell me \nwhether there are any Greeks among the people you\u2019ve turned into wolves \nand lions?\u201d31\nRead what follows and notice too that in praising a certain virtue of the \nanimal, one of the participants in the discussion, Gryllus, places, precisely, \nthis animal virtue above or at a distance from the law. Let me read this ethi-\ncal and political praise of the animal, whose moral and social, even political, \nvirtue goes above or before the law \u2014 a bit like (a \u201clike\u201d that carries the \nwhole charge of the question of an analogy), a bit \u201clike\u201d the sovereign:\nYou can see, however, that when animals \ufb01 ght with one another or with \nyou humans, they do not employ tricks and stratagems: they rely in their \nbattles on blatant bare bravery backed up by real prowess. They don\u2019t need \na law to be passed [my emphasis] to summon them to battle, and they don\u2019t \n\ufb01 ght because they\u2019re afraid of being  court- martialled for desertion: they see \n30.

Devourment and voracity. Devoro, vorax, vora-\ntor. It\u2019s about mouth, teeth, tongue, and the violent rush to bite, engulf, \nswallow the other, to take the other into oneself too, to kill it or mourn \nit. Might sovereignty be devouring? Might its force, its power, its greatest \nforce, its absolute potency be, in essence and always in the last instance, a \npower of devourment (mouth, teeth, tongue, violent rush to bite, engulf, \nswallow the other, to take the other into oneself too, to kill it or mourn it)? \nBut what goes via interiorizing devourment, i.e. via orality, via the mouth, \nthe maw, teeth, throat, glottis, and tongue \u2014 which are also the sites of cry \nand speech, of language \u2014 that very thing can also inhabit that other site of \nthe visage or the face, i.e. the ears, the auricular attributes, the visible and \ntherefore audiovisual forms of what allows one not only to speak but also \nto hear and listen. \u201cGrandmother, what big ears you have,\u201d she says to the \nwolf. The place of devourment is also the place of what carries the voice, \nthe topos of the  porte- voix [megaphone, literally \u201cvoice- carrier\u201d], in a word, \nthe place of vociferation.

The one, vociferation, exteriorizes what is eaten, devoured, or interior-\nized: the other, conversely or simultaneously, i.e. devourment, interiorizes \nwhat is exteriorized or proffered. And on this subject of devouring, proffer-\ning, eating, speaking, and therefore listening, of obeying in receiving within \nthrough the ears, on the subject of the beast and the sovereign, I leave you \nto muse on the ass\u2019s ears of King Midas that Apollo in\ufb02 icted on him because \nhe had preferred his rival in a musical competition. The ass is thought, un-\nfairly, to be the most stupid of beasts [la plus b\u00eate des b\u00eates]. Midas hid these \nass\u2019s ears under his crown, and when his hairdresser denounced him and \ndivulged his secret to the earth, the rushes, Ovid tells us, murmured in the \nwind, \u201cKing Midas has ass\u2019s ears!\u201d And then in Tristan and Yseult, another \nking, another animal\u2019s ears, the horse\u2019s ears of King Mark.\n35. [Translator\u2019s note:] \u201cFigure\u201d in French means both \u201c\ufb01 gure\u201d and \u201cface.\u201d\n46 \n47 \n"

I leave these questions as they are for the moment. But the prin-\nciple of a reply (I shall call it prosthetic or prostatic or prosthstatic, i.e. fol-\nlowing the technical or prosthetic logic of a supplement that supplements \nnature by adding to it an arti\ufb01 cial organ, here the state) seems to come to \nus from what is no doubt the most arresting example (the one that is most \npresent to our memory, and we shall return to it) of this \ufb01 guration of the \npolitical, of the state and sovereignty in the allegory or the fable of the mon-\nstrous animal, and precisely the dragon called Leviathan in the Book of \nJob: I am referring to Hobbes\u2019s book Leviathan (1651).38 Right from its In-\ntroduction, and in an opposition to Aristotle that we shall have to specify \nlater, Hobbes\u2019s Leviathan inscribes human art in the logic of an imitation of \ndivine art. Nature is the art of God when he creates and governs the world, \ni.e. when, by an art of life, a genius of life, he produces the living and thus \ncommands the living. Well, man, who is the most eminent living creation \nof God, the art of man that is the most excellent replica of the art of God, \nthe art of this living being, man, imitates the art of God but, being unable to \ncreate, fabricates and, being unable to engender a natural animal, fabricates \nan arti\ufb01 cial animal. Art goes so far as to imitate this excellent life-form that \n38. [Derrida quotes from] Leviathan, Authoritative Text, Backgrounds, Interpreta-\ntions, ed. Richard E.
