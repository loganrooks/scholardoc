The Teleological Hierarchy of Writings\nAt the peak of this hierarchy is phonetic writing of the alphabetic type: \"Al-\nphabetic writing is on all accounts the more intelligent\" (sec. 459, p. 216). To\nthe extent that it respects, translates, or transcribes the voice, that is, idealization,\nthe movement of the spirit relating itself to its own interiority and hearing itself\n/\nspeak, phonetic writing is the most historic element of culture, the element most\nopen to the infinite development of tradition. At least in the principle of its\nfunctioning: \"What has been said shows the inestimable and not sufficiently\nappreciated educational value of learning to read and write an alphabetic char-\nacter. It leads the mind from the sensibly concrete image to attend to the more\nformal structure of the vocal word and its abstract elements, and contributes\nmuch to give stability and independence to the inward realm of mental life\"\n(sec. 459, p. 218).\nHistory\u2014which according to Hegel is always the history of the spirit\u2014the\ndevelopment of the concept as logos, and the ontotheological unfolding of par-\nousia, etc. are not obstructed by alphabetic writing. On the contrary, since it\nerases its own spacing better than any other, alphabetic writing remains the\nhighest and more relevant\nSuch a teleological appreciation of alpha-\nbetic writing constitutes a system and structurally governs the following two\nconsequences:\na. Beyond the fact of alphabetical writing, Hegel here is calling upon a teleo-\nlogical ideal. In effect, as Hegel recognizes, in passing, certainly, but quite clearly,\nthere is not and there cannot be a purely phonetic writing. The alphabetic\nsystem, such as we practice it, is not and cannot be purely phonetic. Writing\ncan never be totally inhabited by the voice. The nonphonetic functions, if you\nwifi, the operative silences of alphabetic writing, are not factual accidents or\nin transforming names into images, and thus again deposing memory to the level of\nimagination. The place of the power of memory is taken by a permanent tableau (Tableau)\nof a series of images, fixed in the imagination, to which is then attached the series of ideas\nforming the composition to be learned by rote (auswendig). Considering the heterogeneity\nbetween the import of these ideas and those permanent images, and the speed with which\nthe attachment has to be made, the attachment cannot be made otherwise than by shallow,\nsilly, and utterly accidental links\" (Enc., sec. 462, p. 220). This exterionty of the \"by rote\"\nis confronted by living, spiritual memory, in which everything proceeds from the inside.\nAll these developments are governed by the opposition Auswendig/lnwendig and by that\nof Entausserung and Erinnerung in the name. See also the important sections 463\u201464.

A poor model for\nscience and philosophy. \"Hieroglyphic language is a designation of objects which\nhas no relation to the sonorous sign.\u2014The idea of a written philosophical and\nuniversal language, dreamed of by so many minds, comes up against the im-\nmense conglomeration of signs that would have to be elaborated and learned.\"26\nThe naturalness of hieroglyphs, the fact that spirit has only partially mani-\nfested itself, or rather heard itself speak, in them, is quite precisely marked by\na certain absence of the voice, notably in the art forms privileged by Egyptian\nculture. Under the heading of \"Unconscious Symbolism\" Hegel writes: \"Simi-\nlarly the hieroglyphic script of the Egyptians is also largely symbolic, since either\nit tries to make us acquainted with the meanings by sketching actu?l objects\nwhich display (darstellen) not themselves, but a universal related to them, or,\nmore commonly still, in its so-called phonetic element this script indicates the\nindividual letters by illustrating an object the initial letter of which has in speech\nthe same sound as that which is to be expressed\" (Aesth. I, p. 357). Next, invoking\nthe example of the colossi, which according to legend emitted sounds under the\ninfluence of the dew and the first rays of the sun, Hegel believes he can see in\nthem that spirit is only beginning to liberate itself and to recognize itself as such:\n\"But taken as symbols, the meaning to be ascribed to these colossi is that they\ndo not have the spiritual soul freely in themselves and therefore, instead of\nbeing able to draw animation (Belebung) from within, from what bears proportion\nand beauty in itself, they require for it light from without which alone liberates\nthe note of the soul from them. The human voice, on the other hand, resounds\nout of one's own feeling and one's own spirit without any external impulse, just\nas the height of art in general consists in making the inner give shape to itself\nout of its own being. But the inner life of the human form is still dumb (stumrn)\nin Egypt and in its animation (Beseelung) it is only a natural factor that is kept\nin view\" (Aesth. I, p. 358).27\nThe naturalness of the hieroglyphic symbol is the condition for its polysemia.\nFor a polysemia which in Hegel's view does not have the merit of the regulated\nambivalence of certainly naturally speculative words of the German language.\nHere, the obscure instability of meaning has to do with spirit's not having clearly\n26.

The \"symbols of general significations\" are there mani-\nfested by \"writings\" and by \"graven images.\" The forms and figures of the temple therefore\nreplace books, supplement them (die Stelle dL'r Bucher vertreten). \"Here and there Memnons\nlean against the sloping walls which also form galleries and are bedecked all over with\nhieroglyphics or enormous pictures in stone so that they appeared to the French scholars\nwho saw them recently as if they were printed in calico.

Certainly nature has begun to animate itself, and\nitself to relate to itself, itself to examine itself, is in motion enough to signal and\nto symbolize with itself. But spirit does not come back to itself in this, does not\nyet recognize itself. The materiality of the signifier, it could be said, functions\nby itself as \"unconscious symbolism.\" \"Now owing to this alternating symbolism\n(Wechselsymbolik), the symbol in Egypt is at the same time an ensemble of sym-\nbols, so that what at one time appears as meaning (Bedeutung) is also used again\nas a symbol of a related sphere. In a symbolism which confusedly intertwines\n(durcheinarz4erschlingt) meaning and shape, presages a variety of things in fact\nor alludes to them, and therefore already comes close to that inner subjectivity\nwhich alone can develop itself in many directions, the associations are ambig-\nuous (vieldeutig) and this is the virtue of these productions, although their ex-\nplanation is of course made difficult owing to this ambiguity\" (Aesth. I, p. 360).\nThis polysemia is so essential, belongs so necessarily to the structure of the\nhieroglyph, that the difficulty of deciphering has nothing to do with our situation\nor lack of contemporaneity. Hegel specifies, rather, that it had to limit the reading\nof the Egyptians themselves. Hence the transition from Egypt to Greece is the\ndeciphering and deconstitution of the hieroglyph, of the hieroglyph's properly\nsymbolic structure such as it itself is symbolized in the figure of the Sphinx.\nGreece is the answer of Oedipus, which Hegel interprets as the discourse and\noperation of consciousness itself. \"The works of Egyptian art in their mysterious\nsymbolism are therefore riddles; the objective riddle par excellence. As a symbol\nfor this proper meaning of the Egyptian spirit we may mention the Sphinx. It\nis, as it were, the symbol of the symbolic itself.\n.\n. It is in this sense that the\nSphinx in the Greek myth, which we ourselves may interpret again symbolically,\nappears as a monster asking a riddle\" (Aesth. I, p. 360). With his answer, Oedipus\ndestroys the Sphinx. \"The Sphinx propounded the well-known conundrum:\nWhat is it that in the morning goes on four legs, at mid-day on two, and in the\nevening on three? Oedipus found the simple answer: a man, and he tumbled\nthe Sphinx from the rock. The explanation of the symbol lies in the absolute\nmeaning, in the spirit, just as the famous Greek inscription calls to man: Know\nthyself. The light of consciousness is the clarity which makes its concrete content\nshine clearly through the shape belonging and appropriate to itself, and its\nexistence reveals itself alone\" (Aesth. I, p. 361).\nWith the answer to the riddle, Oedipus's words, the discourse of conscious-\nness, man destroys, dissipates, or tumbles the petroglyph. And corresponding\nto the stature of the Sphinx, the animality of spirit asleep in the stony sign, the\nmediation between matter and man, the duplicity of the intermediary, is the\nfigure of Thoth, the god of writing. The place Hegel assigns to this demigod\n(a secondary god, inferior to the god of thought, the animal servant of the great\ngod, man's animal, god's man, etc.) in no way upsets the staging of the Phae-\n99\n"

      "full_text": "The Pit and the Pyramid\nThe Chinese model, which fascinated Leibniz and led him astray, as Hegel\ntakes every opportunity to recall, nevertheless marks a progress over the Egyp-\ntian hieroglyph. A progress in formalizing abstraction, a detachment as concerns\nthe sensuous and the natural symbol. But this progress, which corresponds to\nthe moment of abstract understanding, never recovers what it loses: the spec-\nulative concreteness of Western speech finds then that the process of idealization\nhas even \"relifted\" (relev\u00e9) its sensuous extenority. Whence the analogy between\nthe structure of Chinese writing and the structures of Jormal understanding in\nWestern philosophy circumscribed by Hegel, in particular a certain authority of\nthe mathematical model over philosophy: \"It must certainly be considered that\npure thoughts are brought to consciousness, but in this case we make no ad-\nvance, merely remaining stationary so far as they are concerned. The concrete\nis not conceived of speculatively, but is simply taken from ordinary ideas, in-\nasmuch as it is expressed in accordance with their forms of representation and\nof perception\" (History of Philosophy, pp. 121\u201422).\nFollowing the classical framework of the Hegelian critique, Chinese culture\nand writing are reproached simultaneously for their empiricism (naturalism,\nhistoricism) and their formalism (mathematizing abstraction).3'\nA typical movement of the Hegelian text: speculative dialectics sets on its\ncourse a sometimes quite precise piece of historical information, but without\nprecautions. A certain number of very determined effects result from this,\nand in the very form of that which Hegel elsewhere criticizes: the juxtaposition\nof an empirical content with a henceforth abstract form, an exterior form su-\nperimposed on that which it should organize. This is manifest particularly in\nunnoticed contradictions, contradictions without concepts and not reducible to\nthe speculative movement of contradiction.\nThe propositions concerning Chinese writing and grammar are a symptomatic\nexample of this. In this sense, Chinese grammar is insufficiently developed,\nwhich Hegel does not add to its credit. Compared to Western grammars, Chinese\nsyntax is in a state of stagnant primitiveness, paralyzing the movement of sci-\nence. Hegel, then, contradicts himself twice, though there is no dialectical ne-\ngation of negation; it is rather a denegation, a disavowal. In effect, above we\nnoticed the following two motifs: (1) the development and differentiation of\nor figures (1-lo-tu) which he saw on the back of a horse-dragon as it rose out of the river.\n(Other figures ILo-Choui were borrowed from the back of a tortoise and combined with\nthe signs of Fo-Hi.) This table contains parallel lines above one another, which have a\nsymbolical signification; and the Chinese say that these lines are the foundation of their\ncharacters as also of their philosophy\" (History of Philosophy, p. 121; translation modified).\n31. \"The Chinese have remained with the abstract, and when they arrive at the concrete\none finds, on the theoretical side, an exterior connection of objects of the sensory kind;\none finds no order, no profound intuition, and the rest is morals. The concrete in which\nthe beginning is pursued consists of morals, of the art of government, of history, etc., but\nthis concrete is not of a philosophical order. In China, in Chinese religion and philosophy,\nwe encounter a particularly perfect prose of understanding\" (Gibelin, pp. 252\u201453).\n102\n"

Let us read the text.\n\"For if we consider in the first place, the effect of such a mode of writing on\nthe Spoken Language, we shall find this among the Chinese very imperfect, on\naccount of that separation. For our Spoken Language is matured to distinctness\nchiefly through the necessity of finding signs for each single sound, which latter,\nby reading, we learn to express distinctly. The Chinese, to whom such a means\nof orthoepic development is wanting, do not mature the modifications of sounds\nin their language to distinct articulations capable of being represented by letters\nand syllables. Their Spoken Language consists of an inconsiderable number of\nmonosyllabic words, which are used with more than one signification. The sole\nmethods of denoting distinctions of meaning are the connection, the accent, and\nthe pronunciation\u2014quicker or slower, softer or louder. The ears of the Chinese\nhave become very sensible to such distinctions. Thus I find that the word Po\nhas eleven different meanings according to the tone: denoting 'glass'\u2014'to boil'\u2014\n'to winnow wheat'\u2014'to cleave asunder'\u2014'to water'\u2014'to prepare'\u2014'an old\nwoman'\u2014'a\nliberal man'\u2014'a wise person'\u2014'a little'\" (Philosophy of\nHistory, p. 135).M The discourse of the Chinese, then, entangles itself in the\ndissemination of meanings and accents. Their writing, no longer reflecting or\nreassembling living language, paralyzes itself far from the concept, in the cold\nspace of formal abstraction, that is in space. In sum, Hegel reproaches the Chinese\nfor speaking too much when they speak, and for writing too much when they\nwrite.\nSuch a procedure is at least consequent with the system which links the logos\nto alphabetical writing, as soon as alphabetical writing is taken as an absolute\nmodel. Speculative dialectics permits itself to be separated neither from logos\nnor, simultaneously, from the logos which never thinks or presents itself except\nin its historical complicity with the voice and phonetic writing. The grammar\nof the logos thus being confused with the system of metaphysics, Hegel may\nwrite, in the course of a long elaboration on the Tao To King: \"According to Abel\nR\u00e9musat, Tao means to the Chinese 'Way, means of communication from one\nplace to another,' and then reason, substance, principle. All of this condensed\nto the metaphorical, metaphysical sense signifies way in general. . . Tao, thus,\nis the 'original reason, the nous (intelligence) which has brought forth the world\nand governs it as spirit governs the body.' Abel R\u00e9musat says that taken at its\nbest this might be expressed by the Greek in logos. However, this remains quite\nconfused. The Chinese language, due to its grammatical structure, creates many\ndifficulties; notably, these objects are difficult to exhibit because of their inher-\nently abstract and undetermined nature. Von Humboldt recently showed, in a\nletter to Abel Remusat, how undetermined the grammatical construction was\n(C. von Humboldt, Letter to M. Abel Remusat On the Nature of the Grammatical\n34. The same argument can be found in sec. 459 of the Encyclopedia.\n104\n"

To write and to calculate: the machine. In assigning the limits of so-called\nuniversal writing, that is, a mute writing, released from the voice and from every\nnatural language, Hegel also criticizes the pretensions of mathematical symbol-\nism and of arithmetic, the operations of formal understanding. The silence of\nthis writing and the space of calculation would interrupt the movement of the\nA uf he bung, or in any case would resist the interiorization of the past (Erinnerung),\nthe relevant idealization, the history of the spirit, the reappropriation of the logos\nin self-presence and infinite parousia. If the passage through mathematical ab-\nstraction, through formal understanding, spacing, exteriority and death (see the\npreface to the Phenomenology of Spirit) is a necessary passage (the work of the\nnegative, the shedding of the sensory, pedagogical asceticism, purification of\nthis necessity becomes perversion and regression as soon as it is\ntaken as a philosophical model.\nThis is the attitude inaugurated by Pythagoras.

About the Y-King:\". . . the philosophy of the Chinese\nappears therefore to proceed from the same fundamental ideas as that of Py-\nthagoras\" (Philosophy of History, p. 136). \"As we know, Pythagoras represented\n(dargestelit) rational relationships (or philosophemata) by numbers; and more\nrecently, too, numbers and forms of their relations, such as powers and so on,\nhave been employed in philosophy for the purpose of regulating thoughts or\nexpressing\nNumber, or equally, that which can do without any phonetic notation, is\nabsulutely foreign to the concept such as Hegel understands it. More precisely,\nit is contrary to the concept.

With these words I\nam designating less a fact than a project, which is linked by its essence, (and\nwe should say by essence itself, by the thought of Being and of truth), to a\ncertain group of languages and \"cultures.\" For something must happen or must\nhave happened to the diaphanous purity of this element.\nHow else are we to understand that international colloquia\u2014which aim to\nrepair, to surmount, to erase, or simply to relate national philosophical differ-\nences one to another\u2014seem possible and necesary?

Even if one does not wish\nto summarize Sartre's thought under the slogan \"existentialism is a humanism,\"\nit must be recognized that in Being and Nothingness, The Sketch of a Theory of the\nEmotions, etc., the major concept, the theme of the last analysis, the irreducible\nhorizon and origin is what was then called \"human-reality.\" As is well known,\nthis is a translation of Heideggerian Dasein. A monstrous translation in many\nrespects, but so much the more significant. That this translation proposed by\nCorbin was adopted at the time, and that by means of Sartre's authority it\nreigned, gives us much to think about the reading or the nonreading of Hei-\ndegger during this period, and about what was at stake in reading or not reading\nhim in this way.\nCertainly the notion of \"human-reality\" translated the project of thinking the\nmeaning of man, the humanity of man, on a new basis, if you will. If the neutral\nand undetermined notion of \"human reality\" was substituted for the notion of\nman, with all its metaphysical heritage and the substantialist motif or temptation\ninscribed in it, it was also in order to suspend all the presuppositions which had\nalways constituted the concept of the unity of man. Thus, it was also a reaction\nagainst a certain intellectualist or spiritualist humanism which had dominated\nFrench philosophy (Brunschvig, Alain, Bergson, etc.). And this neutralization\nof every metaphysical or speculative thesis as concerns the unity of the anthropos\ncould be considered in some respects as the faithful inheritance of Husserl's\ntranscendental phenomenology and of the fundamental ontology in Sein und\nZeit (the only partially known work of Heidegger's at the time, along with What\nIs Metaphysics? and Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics). And yet, despite this\nalleged neutralization of metaphysical presuppositions,4 it must be recognized\nthat the unity of man is never examined in and of itself. Not only is existentialism\na humanism, but the ground and horizon of what Sartre then called his \"phe-\nnomenological ontology\" (the subtitle of Being and Nothingness) remains the unity\nof human-reality. To the extent that it describes the structures of human-reality,\n4. The humanism which marks Sartre's philosophical discourse in its depths. however,\nis very surely and very ironically taken apart in Nausea: in the caricature of the Autodidact,\nfor example, the same figure reassembles the theological project of absolute knowledge\nand the humanist ethic, in the form of the encyclopedic epistemophilia which leads the\nAutodidact to undertake the reading of the world library (which is really the Western\nlibrary, and definitely the municipal library) in alphabetical order by author's name, and\nin areas where he is able to love Man (\"There is an aim, sir, there is an aim. . . there are\nmen. . . one must love them, one must love them\") in the representation of men, pref-\nerably young men. It is in the dialogue with the Autodidact that Roquentin levels the\nworst charges against humanism, against all humanist styles; and at the moment when\nnausea is slowly rising in him, he says to himself, for example, \"I don't want to be\nintegrated, I don't want my good red blood to go and fatten this lymphatic beast: I will\nnot be fool enough to call myself 'anti-humanist.'

The Hegelian concepts of truth, negativity, and Aufhebung, with all their\nresults, prevent this from being so. In the third part of the Encyclopedia which\ntreats the \"Philosophy of Spirit,\" the first section (\"Philosophy of Spirit\") in-\nscribes the Phenomenology of Spirit between the \"Anthropology\" and the \"Psy-\nchology.\" The Phenomenology of Spirit succeeds the Anthropology and precedes\nthe Psychology. The Anthropology treats the spirit\u2014which is the \"truth of na-\nture\"\u2014as soul or as natural-spirit (Seele or Nat urgeist). The development of the\nsoul, such as it is retraced by the anthropology, passes through the natural soul\n(naturliche Seele), through the sensible soul (fuhlende Seele), and through the real\nor effective soul (wirkliche Seele). This development accomplishes and completes\nitself, and then opens onto consciousness. The last section of the Anthropology'2\ndefines the general form of consciousness, the very one from which the Phen-\nomenology of Spirit will depart, in the first chapter on \"Sensuous Certitude.\"3\nConsciousness, i.e. the phenomenological, therefore, is the truth of the soul,\nthat is, precisely the truth of that which was the object of the anthropology.\nConsciousness is the truth of man, phenomenology is the truth of anthropology.\n\"Truth,\" here, must be understood in a rigorously Hegelian sense.

Such a discourse,\nin Hegel as in the entirety of metaphysics, indissociably coordinates teleology\nwith an eschatology, a theology, and an ontology.

What is difficult to think today is an end of man which would not be\norganized by a dialectics of truth and negativity, an end of man which would\nnot be a teleology in the first person plural.

The teleology which governs Husserl's transcendental\nphenomenology can be read in the same opening. Despite the critique of an-\nthropologism, \"humanity,\" here, is still the name of the being to which the\ntranscendental telos\u2014determined as Idea (in the Kantian sense) or even as Rea-\nson\u2014is announced. It is man as animal rationale who, in his most classical me-\ntaphysical determination, designates the site of teleological reason's unfolding,\nthat is, history. For Husserl as for Hegel, reason is history, and there is no history\nbut of reason. The latter \"functions in every man, the animal rationale, no matter\nhow primitive he is. . .\" Every kind of humanity and human sociality has \"a\noccult qualities (which might be called hypophysical), is not only an indispensable substrate\nof all theoretically sound and definite knowledge of duties; it is also a desideratum of the\nhighest importance to the actual fulfilment of its precepts\" (\"Foundations of the Meta;\nphysics of Morals,\" in The Crit ique of Practical Reason\n.\n. , p. 70). \"Furthermore, it is evident\nthat it is not only of the greatest necessity in a theoretical point of view when it is a\nquestion of speculation but also of the utmost practical importance to derive the concepts\nand laws of morals from pure reason and to present them pure and unmixed, and to\ndetermine the scope of this entire practical but pure rational knowledge (the entire faculty\nof pure practical reason) without making the principles depend upon the particular nature\nof human reason, as speculative philosophy may permit and even sometimes find nec-\nessary. But since moral laws should hold for every rational being as such, the principles\nmust be derived from the universal concept of a rational being generally. In this manner\nall morals, which need anthropology for their application to men, must be completely\ndeveloped first as pure philosophy, i.e. metaphysics, independently of anthropology\"\n(ibid., p. 71). \"With a view to attaining this, it is extremely important to remember that\nwe must not let ourselves think that the reality of this principle can be derived from the\nparticular constitution of human nature 'aus der besondern Eigenschaft der menschlichen Nat ur).\nFor duty is practical unconditional necessity of action; it must, therefore, hold for all\nrational beings (to which alone an imperative can apply), and only for that reason can it be\na law for all human wills\" (ibid., p. 83). We see in these three passages that what is always\nof the \"greatest importance\" (von der hochsten Wichtigkeit ... von der grossten praktischen\nWichtigkeit .\n. . von der \u00e4ussersten Wichtigkeif) is to determine the end in itself (as an un-\nconditioned principle of morality), independently of any anthropological givens. One\ncannot think the purity of the end of the basis of man.\nB. But, on the other hand, and inversely, man's specificity, man's essence as a rational\nbeing, as the rational animal (zOoii logon ekhon), announces itself to itself only on the basis\nof thinking the end in itself; it announces itself to itself as the end in itself; that is, equally,\nas an infinite end, since the thinking of the unconditioned is also the thinking which raises\nitself above experience, that is, above finitude. Thus is explained the fact that despite the\ncritique of anthropologism, of which we have just given a few indices, man is the only\nexample, the only case of a rational being that can ever be cited at the very moment when\nby all rights one distinguishes the universal concept of a rational being from the concept\nof the human being. It is through the offices of this fact that anthropology regains all its\ncontested authority. This is the point at which the philosopher says \"we,\" and at which\nin Kant's discourse \"rational being\" and \"humanity\" are always associated by the con-\njunction \"and\" or vel. For example \"Now, I say, man and in general (und uberhaupt) every\nrational being, exists as an end in himself, and not merely as a means\" (Foundations .\np. 86). [Note that this phrase is from the passage that serves as the first epigraph to this\ntext. The deconstruction of the end and of man takes place on the margins of philosophy:\nin titles and footnotes.] \"This principle of humanity and of every rational creature as an\nend in itself\" (ibid., pp. 88-89).\n122\n"

The end of man\n(as a factual anthropological limit) is announced to thought from the vantage\nof the end of man (as a determined opening or the infinity of a telos). Man is\nthat which is in relation to his end, in the fundamentally equivocal sense of the\nword. Since always. The transcendental end can appear to itself and be unfolded\nonly on the condition of mortality, of a relation to finitude as the origin of ideality.\nThe name of man has always been inscribed in metaphysics between these two\nends. It has meaning only in this eschato-teleological situation.\nReading Us\nThe \"we,\" which in one way or another always has had to refer to itself in the\nlanguage of metaphysics and in philosophical discourse, arises out of this sit-\nuation. To conclude, what about this we in the text which better than any other\nhas given us to read the essential, historical complicity of metaphysics and\nhumanism in all their forms? What about this we, then, in Heidegger's text?\nThis is the most difficult question, and we will only begin to consider it. We\nare not going to empnison all of Heidegger's text in a closure that this text has\ndelimited better than any other. That which links humanism and metaphysics\nas ontotheology became legible as such in Sein und Zeit, the Letter on Humanism,\nand the later texts. Referring to this acquisition, attempting to take it into account,\nI would like to begin to sketch out the forms of the hold which the \"humanity\"\nof man and the thinking of Being, a certain humanism and the truth of Being,\n16. \"The Origin of Geometry,\" in The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phen-\nornenology, trans.

This style of a reading which makes explicit, practices\na continual bringing to light, something which resembles, at least, a coming into\nconsciousness, without break, displacement, or change of terrain.

The motif of proximity surely\nfinds itself caught in an opposition which henceforth will unceasingly regulate\nHeidegger's discourse. The fifth section of Sein und Zeit in effect seems not to\ncontradict but to limit and contain what was already gained, to wit that the\nDasein \"which we are\" constitutes the exemplary being for the hermeneutic of\nthe meaning of Being by virtue of its proximity to itself, of our proximity to\nourselves, our proximity to the being that we are. At this point Heidegger marks\nthat this proximity is ontic. Ontologically, that is, as concerns the Being of that\nbeing which we are, the distance, on the contrary, is as great as possible. \"On-\ntically, of course, Dasein is not only close to us\u2014even that which is closest: we\nare it, each of us, we ourselves.

The Da of\nDasein and the Da of Sein will signify as much the near as the far. Beyond the\ncommon closure of humanism and metaphysics, Heidegger's thought will be\n21. \"In demonstrating that Dasein is ontico-ontologically prior, we may have misled the\nreader into supposing that this entity must also be what is given as ontico-ontologically\nprimary (primar), not only in the sense that it can itself be grasped 'immediately,' but also\nin that the kind of Being which it possesses is presented just as 'immediately.' Ontically.\nof course, Dasein is not only close to us\u2014even that which is closest: we are it, each of us,\nwe ourselves. In spite of this, or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which\nis farthest .\n. . Dasein is ontically 'closest' (an, n\u00e4chsten) to itself and ontologically farthest;\nbut pre-ontologically it is surely not a stranger (nichi fremd)\" (pp. 36\u201437).\n127\n"

Ibid., p. 212.\n33. Ibid., p. 213.\n34. \"The 'Introduction' to Being and Time says simply and clearly, even in italics, 'Being\nis the transcendens pure and simple (das Transcendens sch!echthin).' Just as the openness of\nspatial nearness seen from the perspective of a particular thing exceeds all things near\nand far, so is Being essentially broader than all beings, because it is the lighting (Lichiung)\nitself. For all that, Being is thought on the basis of beings, a consequence of the approach\u2014\nat first unavoidable\u2014within a metaphysics that is still dominant.\" \"Letter,\" p. 216.\n35. Several examples of the predominance granted to the value of ontological proximity:\n\"This destiny comes to pass as the lighting of Being (Lichtung des Seins), as which it is.\nThe lighting grants nearness to Being. In this nearness, in the lighting of the Da, man\ndwells as the ek-sisting one without yet being able properly to experience and take over\nthis dwelling. In the lecture on Holderlin's elegy 'Homecoming' (1943) this nearness\n'of' Being, which the Da of Dasein is, is thought on the basis of Being and Time .\n.\n. it is\ncalled the 'homeland' \"(ibid., p. 217). \"The homeland of this historical dwelling is nearness\nto Being\" (ibid., p. 218). \"In his essential unfolding within the history of Being, man is\nthe being whose Being as ek-sistence consists in his dwelling in the nearness of Being\n(in der N\u00e4he des Seins wohut). Man is the neighbor of Being (Nachbar des Seins)\" (ibid., p.\n222). \" 'Ek-sistence,' in fundamental contrast to every existentia and 'existence,' is ecstatic\ndwelling in the nearness of Being\" (ibid.). \"Or should thinking, by means of open resis-\ntance to 'humanism,' risk a shock that could for the first time cause perplexity concerning\nthe hutnanitas of liouzo humanus and its basis? In this way it could awaken a reflection\n(Besinnung)\u2014if the world-historical moment did not itself already compel such a reflec-\n131\n"

      "full_text": "The Ends of Man\nThus, the prevalence granted to the phenoinenological metaphor, to all the va-\nrieties of phainesthai, of shining, lighting, clearing, Lichtung, etc., opens onto the\nspace of presence and the presence of space, understood within the opposition\nof the near and the far\u2014just as the acknowledged privilege not only of language,\nbut of spoken language (voice, listening, etc.), is in consonance with the motif\nof presence as\nThe near and the far are thought here, conse-\ntion\u2014that thinks not only about man but also about the 'nature' of man, not only about\nhis nature but even more primordially about the dimension in which the essence of man,\ndetermined by Being itself is at home\" (ibid., p. 225). \"Thinking does not overcome\nmetaphysics by climbing still higher, surmounting it, transcending it somehow or other;\nthinking overcomes metaphysics by climbing back down into the nearness of nearest (in\ndie N\u00e4he des N\u00e4chsten)\" (ibid., p. 231).\nTo destroy the privilege of the present-now (Gegenwart) always leads back, on the Hei-\ndeggerian pathway, to a presence (Anwesen, Anuiesenheit) that none of the three modes of\nthe present (present-present, past-present, future-present) can exhaust or terminate, but\nwhich, on the contrary, provides their playing space, on the basis of a fourfold whose\nthinking entirely informs what is at stake in our question. The fourfold can be maintained\nor lost, risked or reappropriated\u2014an alternative always suspended over its \"own proper\"\nabysm\u2014never winning except by losing (itself). It is the text of dissemination.\nNow this presence of the fourfold, in turn, is thought, in On Time and Being notably,\naccording to the opening of propriation as the nearness of the near, proximation, ap-\nproximation. Here we will refer to the analysis of the four-dimensionality of time and of\nits play. \"True time is four-dimensional ... For this reason we call the first, original,\nliterally incipient extending (Reichen) in which the unity of true (eigentlichen) time consists\n'nearing nearness,' 'nearhood' (Nahheit), an early word still used by Kant. But it brings\nfuture, past and present near to one apother by distancing them.\" On Time and Being,\ntrans. Joan Stambaugh (New York: Harper and Row, 1972), p. 15. \"In the sending of the\ndestiny of Being (Im Schicken des Geschickes von Sein), in the extending (Reichen) of time,\nthere becomes manifest a dedication (Zueignen), a delivering over (Ubereignen) into what\nis their own (in ihr Eigenes), namely of Being as presence (Anwesenheit) and of time as the\nrealm of the open. What determines both, time and Being, in their own, that is in their\nbelonging together, we shall call: Ereignis, or event of Appropriation\" (ibid., p. 19). \"What\nthe name 'event of Appropriation' (Ereignis) names can no longer be represented by means\nof the current meaning of the word; for in that meaning 'event of Appropriation' is\nunderstood in the sense of occurrence and happening\u2014not in terms of Appropriating\n(Eignen) as the extending and sending which opens and preserves\" (ibid., p. 20).\nThe facility, and also the necessity, of the transition from the near to the proper will\nhave been noticed. The Latin medium of this transition (prope, proprius) is lost in other\nlanguages, for example in German.\n36. On the topic of what unites the values of self-presence and spoken language, I\npermit myself to refer toOf Granimatology and Speech and Phenomena. Implicitly or explicitly,\nthe valorization of spoken language is constant and massive in Heidegger. I will study it\nelsewhere in and of itself. Having reached a certain point in the analysis, it is necessary\nto measure the extent of this valorization rigorously: if it covers almost the entirety of\nHeidegger's text (in that it leads all the metaphysical determinations of the present or of\nbeing back to the matrix of Being as presence, Anwesenheit), it is also erased at the point\nat which is announced the question of a Wesen that would not even be an Anwesen. (On\nthis subject, see \"Ousia and Gramme,\" above.) Thus is explained, for example, the dis-\nqualification of literature, which is opposed to thinking and to Dichtung, and also to an\nartisan- and \"peasant\"-like practice of the letter: \"In written form thinking easily loses its\nflexibility.\n. . On the other hand, written composition exerts a wholesome pressure toward\ndeliberate linguistic formulation\" (\"Letter,\" p. 195). \"The truth of Being. . . would thus\n132\n"

The near isthe\nis the nearest (prgpe, proprius). Man is the proper of\nwhkh right near to him whispers in his ear; Being is the proper of man, such\nis the truth that speaks, such is the proposition which gives the there of the truth\nof Being and the truth of man. This proposition of the proper, certainly, is not\nto be taken in a metaphysical sense: the proper of man, here, is not an essential\nattribute, the predicate of a substance, a characteristic among others, however\nfundamental, of a being, object or subject, called man. No more can one speak\nin this sense of man as the proper of Being. Propriety, the co-propriety of Being\nand man, is proximity as inseparability. But it is indeed as inseparability that\nthe relations between being (substance, or res) and its essential predicate were\nthought in metaphysics afterward. Since this\nof man and of Being,\nsuch as itis thought in Heidegger's discourse, is not ontic, does not relate two\n'beings\none to the other but rather, within language, relates the meaning of\nthe meaning -of man. The proper of man, his Eigenheit,\n\"authen-\nticity,\" is to be related to the meaning of Being; he is to hear and to question\n(fragen) it in ek-sistence, to stand straight in the proximity of its light: \"Das\nStehen in der Lichtung des Seins nenne ich die Ek-sistenz des Menschen. Nur\ndem Menschen eignet diese Art zu sein\" (\"Such standing in the lighting of Being\nI call the ek-sistence of man. This way of Being is proper only to man\")Y\nIs not this security of the near what is trembling today, that is, the co-belonging\nand co-propriety of the name of man and the name of Being, such as this co-\npropriety inhabits, and is inhabited by, the language of the West, such as it is\nburied in its oikonomia, such as it is inscribed and forgotten according to the\nhistory of metaphysics, and such as it is awakened also by the destruction of\nontotheology? But this trembling\u2014which can only come from a certain outside\u2014\nwas already requisite within the very structure that it\nIts margin was\nbe more easily weaned from mere supposing and opining and directed to the now rare\nhandicraft of writing\" (ibid., p. 223). \"What is needed in the present world crisis is less\nphilosophy, but more attentiveness in thinking; less literature, but more cultivation of the\nletter\" (ibid., p. 242). \"We must liberate Dichtung from literature\" (text published in Revue\nde poesie, Pans, 1967).\n37. Elsewhere (\"La parole souffl\u00e9e,\" in Writing and Difference, and in of Grammatology)\nI have attempted to indicate the passage between the near, the \"proper\" and the erection\nof the \"standing upright.\"\n38. TN. Derrida is using \"to solicit\" in its etymological sense here, as he often does\nelsewhere. \"To solicit\" derives from the Latin sollus, whole, and ciere, to move, and thus\nhas the sense of \"to make the whole move.\" The reference to oikonomia and burial in the\npreceding sentence is explained in \"La differance,\" note 2, above.\n133\n"
