The substitute does not substitute\nitself for anything which has somehow existed before it. Henceforth, it\nwas necessary to begin thinking that there was no center, that the\ncenter could not be thought in the form of a present-being, that the\ncenter had no natural site, that it was not a \ufb01xed locus but a function, a\nsort of nonlocus in which an in\ufb01nite number of sign-substitutions\nstructure, sign and play 353\n"

When L\u00e9vi-Strauss says in the preface to The Raw and the Cooked\nthat he has \u201csought to transcend the opposition between the sensi-\nble and the intelligible by operating from the outset at the level of\nsigns,\u201d2 the necessity, force, and legitimacy of his act cannot make us\nforget that the concept of the sign cannot in itself surpass this oppos-\nition between the sensible and the intelligible. The concept of the sign,\nin each of its aspects, has been determined by this opposition through-\nout the totality of its history. It has lived only on this opposition and its\nsystem. But we cannot do without the concept of the sign, for we\ncannot give up this metaphysical complicity without also giving up the\ncritique we are directing against this complicity, or without the risk of\nerasing di\ufb00erence in the self-identity of a signi\ufb01ed reducing its signi-\n\ufb01er into itself or, amounting to the same thing, simply expelling its\nsigni\ufb01er outside itself. For there are two heterogenous ways of erasing\nthe di\ufb00erence between the signi\ufb01er and the signi\ufb01ed: one, the classic\nway, consists in reducing or deriving the signi\ufb01er, that is to say, ultim-\nately in submitting the sign to thought; the other, the one we are using\nhere against the \ufb01rst one, consists in putting into question the system\nin which the preceding reduction functioned: \ufb01rst and foremost, the\nopposition between the sensible and the intelligible. For the paradox is\nthat the metaphysical reduction of the sign needed the opposition it\nwas reducing. The opposition is systematic with the reduction. And\nwhat we are saying here about the sign can be extended to all the\nconcepts and all the sentences of metaphysics, in particular to the\ndiscourse on \u201cstructure.\u201d But there are several ways of being caught in\nthis circle. They are all more or less na\u00efve, more or less empirical, more\nor less systematic, more or less close to the formulation\u2014that is, to the\nformalization\u2014of this circle. It is these di\ufb00erences which explain the\nmultiplicity of destructive discourses and the disagreement between\nthose who elaborate them.

One reads in The Savage Mind, \u201cLike\nbricolage on the technical plane, mythical re\ufb02ection can reach brilliant\nunforeseen results on the intellectual plane. Conversely, attention has\noften been drawn to the mythopoetical nature of bricolage.\u201d6\nBut L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s remarkable endeavor does not simply consist in\nproposing, notably in his most recent investigations, a structural sci-\nence of myths and of mythological activity. His endeavor also\nappears\u2014I would say almost from the outset\u2014to have the status which\nhe accords to his own discourse on myths, to what he calls his \u201cmytho-\nlogicals.\u201d It is here that his discourse on the myth re\ufb02ects on itself and\ncriticizes itself. And this moment, this critical period, is evidently of\nconcern to all the languages which share the \ufb01eld of the human sci-\nences. What does L\u00e9vi-Strauss say of his \u201cmythologicals\u201d? It is here that\nwe rediscover the mythopoetical virtue of bricolage. In e\ufb00ect, what\nappears most fascinating in this critical search for a new status of\ndiscourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a\nsubject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute archia. The\ntheme of this decentering could be followed throughout the \u201cOver-\nture\u201d to his last book, The Raw and the Cooked. I shall simply remark on a\nfew key points.\n1. From the very start, L\u00e9vi-Strauss recognizes that the Bororo myth\nwhich he employs in the book as the \u201creference myth\u201d does not merit\nthis name and this treatment. The name is specious and the use of the\nmyth improper. This myth deserves no more than any other its referen-\ntial privilege: \u201cIn fact, the Bororo myth, which I shall refer to from now\non as the key myth, is, as I shall try to show, simply a transformation, to\na greater or lesser extent, of other myths originating either in the same\nsociety or in neighboring or remote societies. I could, therefore, have\nlegitimately taken as my starting point any one representative myth of\nthe group. From this point of view, the key myth is interesting not\nbecause it is typical, but rather because of its irregular position within\nthe group.\u201d7\nstructure, sign and play 361\n"

It must avoid the violence that consists in\ncentering a language which describes an acentric structure if it is not to\nshortchange the form and movement of myth. Therefore it is necessary\nto forego scienti\ufb01c or philosophical discourse, to renounce the episte\u00afme\u00af\nwhich absolutely requires, which is the absolute requirement that we\ngo back to the source, to the center, to the founding basis, to the\nprinciple, and so on.

This is what L\u00e9vi-\nStrauss says in The Raw and the Cooked, from which I would now like to\nquote a long and remarkable passage:\nThe study of myths raises a methodological problem, in that it cannot\nbe carried out according to the Cartesian principle of breaking down\nthe dif\ufb01culty into as many parts as may be necessary for \ufb01nding the\nsolution. There is no real end to methodological analysis, no hidden\nunity to be grasped once the breaking-down process has been com-\npleted. Themes can be split up ad in\ufb01nitum. Just when you think you\nhave disentangled and separated them, you realize that they are knit-\nting together again in response to the operation of unexpected af\ufb01n-\nities. Consequently the unity of the myth is never more than tendential\nand projective and cannot re\ufb02ect a state or a particular moment of the\nmyth. It is a phenomenon of the imagination, resulting from the\nattempt at interpretation; and its function is to endow the myth with\nsynthetic form and to prevent its disintegration into a confusion of\nopposites. The science of myths might therefore be termed \u201canaclas-\ntic,\u201d if we take this old term in the broader etymological sense which\nincludes the study of both re\ufb02ected rays and broken rays.

The risk I am speaking of is always assumed\nby L\u00e9vi-Strauss, and it is the very price of this endeavor. I have said that\nempiricism is the matrix of all faults menacing a discourse which\ncontinues, as with L\u00e9vi-Strauss in particular, to consider itself scienti\ufb01c.\nIf we wanted to pose the problem of empiricism and bricolage in depth,\nwe would probably end up very quickly with a number of absolutely\ncontradictory propositions concerning the status of discourse in struc-\ntural ethnology. On the one hand, structuralism justi\ufb01ably claims to be\nthe critique of empiricism. But at the same time there is not a single\nbook or study by L\u00e9vi-Strauss which is not proposed as an empirical\nessay which can always be completed or invalidated by new informa-\ntion.

This is no doubt due to the fact that there are two ways of\nconceiving the limit of totalization. And I assert once more that these\ntwo determinations coexist implicitly in L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s discourse. Total-\nization can be judged impossible in the classical style: one then refers\nto the empirical endeavor of either a subject or a \ufb01nite richness which\nit can never master. There is too much, more than one can say. But\nnontotalization can also be determined in another way: no longer from\nthe standpoint of a concept of \ufb01nitude as relegation to the empirical,\nbut from the standpoint of the concept of play. If totalization no longer\nhas any meaning, it is not because the in\ufb01niteness of a \ufb01eld cannot be\ncovered by a \ufb01nite glance or a \ufb01nite discourse, but because the nature\nof the \ufb01eld\u2014that is, language and a \ufb01nite language\u2014excludes totaliza-\ntion. This \ufb01eld is in e\ufb00ect that of play, that is to say, a \ufb01eld of in\ufb01nite\nsubstitutions only because it is \ufb01nite, that is to say, because instead of\nbeing an inexhaustible \ufb01eld, as in the classical hypothesis, instead of\nbeing too large, there is something missing from it: a center which\narrests and grounds the play of substitutions. One could say\u2014\nrigorously using that word whose scandalous signi\ufb01cation is always\nobliterated in French\u2014that this movement of play, permitted by the\nlack or absence of a center or origin, is the movement of supplementarity.\nOne cannot determine the center and exhaust totalization because the\nsign which replaces the center, which supplements it, taking the cen-\nter\u2019s place in its absence\u2014this sign is added, occurs as a surplus, as a\nsupplement.12 The movement of signi\ufb01cation adds something, which\nresults in the fact that there is always more, but this addition is a\n\ufb02oating one because it comes to perform a vicarious function, to\nstructure, sign and play 365\n"

For example: \u2018A zero phoneme is opposed to all the other phon-\nemes in French in that it entails no di\ufb00erential characters and no con-\nstant phonetic value. On the contrary, the proper function of the zero\nphoneme is to be opposed to phoneme absence.\u2019 (R. Jakobson and J.\nLutz, \u201cNotes on the French Phonemic Pattern,\u201d Word 5, no. 2 [August\n1949]: 155). Similarly, if we schematize the conception I am propos-\ning here, it could almost be said that the function of notions like mana is\nto be opposed to the absence of signi\ufb01cation, without entailing by\nitself any particular signi\ufb01cation.\u201d14\nThe overabundance of the signi\ufb01er, its supplementary character, is thus the\nresult of a \ufb01nitude, that is to say, the result of a lack which must be\nsupplemented.\nIt can now be understood why the concept of play is important in\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss. His references to all sorts of games, notably to roulette, are\nvery frequent, especially in his Conversations,15 in Race and History,16 and in\nThe Savage Mind. Further, the reference to play is always caught up in\ntension.\nTension with history, \ufb01rst of all. This is a classical problem, objec-\ntions to which are now well worn. I shall simply indicate what seems to\nme the formality of the problem: by reducing history, L\u00e9vi-Strauss has\ntreated as it deserves a concept which has always been in complicity\nwith a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words,\nparadoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which\nit was believed history could be opposed. The thematic of historicity,\nalthough it seems to be a somewhat late arrival in philosophy, has\nalways been required by the determination of Being as presence. With\nor without etymology, and despite the classic antagonism which\nopposes these signi\ufb01cations throughout all of classical thought, it could\nbe shown that the concept of episte\u00afme\u00af has always called forth that of\nhistoria, if history is always the unity of a becoming, as the tradition of\nstructure, sign and play 367\n"

TN. The most consistently dif\ufb01cult sections of Derrida\u2019s texts are his\n\u201cprefatory\u201d remarks, for reasons that he has explained in \u201cHors-livre,\u201d\nthe preface to La diss\u00e9mination (Paris: Seuil, 1972). The question\nhinges upon the classical difference between a philosophical text and\nits preface, the preface usually being a recapitulation of the truth pre-\nsented by the text. Since Derrida challenges the notion that a text can\npresent a truth, his prefaces\u2014in which this challenge is anticipated\u2014\nmust especially mark that which makes a text explode the classical\nideas of truth and presence. And they must do so without letting the\npreface anticipate this \u201cconclusion\u201d as a single, clear, luminous truth.\nThus the complication of these prefaces. One way of complicating a\npreface is to leave as a knot that which will later become several\nstrands. Here, the relationship between history, somnambulism, the\n\u201cquestion\u201d and the difference between almost-everything and almost-\nnothing is not explained, for the unraveling of this question touches at\nleast on the topics of the relationship between history and philosophy\n(cf. below, \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d), and the relation of both of\nthese, as writing or texts, to Freud\u2019s analysis of the \u201ctext of somnambu-\nlism,\u201d i.e., The interpretation of Dreams (cf. below, \u201cFreud and the\nScene of Writing\u201d).\n4. On the theme of the separation of the writer, cf. particularly chapter 3 of\nJean Rousset\u2019s introduction of his Forme et Signi\ufb01cation. Delacroix,\nDiderot, Balzac, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, Proust, Val\u00e9ry, Henry James,\nT. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf are called upon to bear witness to the fact\nthat separation is diametrically opposed to critical impotency. By\ninsisting upon this separation between the critical act and creative\nforce, we are only designating the most banally essential\u2014others\nmight say, structural\u2014necessity attached to these two actions and\nmoments. Impotence, here, is a property not of the critic but of criti-\ncism. The two are sometimes confused. Flaubert does not deny him-\nself this confusion. This is brought to light in the admirable collection\nof letters edited by Genevi\u00e8ve Boll\u00e8me and entitled Pr\u00e9face \u00e0 la vie\nnotes to pages 2\u20133\n380\n"

Here are several formulations of this \u201cpermanent structure\u201d: \u201cwhere\nis the true play?

The play is over when the two levels are indistinguishable, that\nis, when the group of heroes watched by the spectators sees itself as\nthe spectator-characters saw them. The real resolution is not the mar-\nriage promised to us at the fall of the curtain but the encounter of\nheart and vision\u201d (ibid., p. 58) \u201cWe are invited to follow the develop-\nment of the play in two registers, which offer us two parallel curves\nthat are separated, however, different in their importance, their lan-\nguage, and their function: the one rapidly sketched, the other fully\ndrawn in all its complexity, the \ufb01rst letting us guess the direction that\nthe second will take, the second deeply echoing the \ufb01rst, providing its\nde\ufb01nitive meaning. This play of interior re\ufb02ections contributes to the\nimparting of a rigorous and supple geometry to Marivaux\u2019s play, while\nat the same time closely linking the two registers, even up to the\nmovements of love\u201d (ibid., p. 59).\n50.

It is necessary, and it is perhaps time to come\nback to the ahistorical in a sense radically opposed to that of classical\nphilosophy: not to misconstrue negativity, but this time to af\ufb01rm it\u2014\nsilently. It is negativity and not positive truth that is the nonhistorical\ncapital of history. In question then would be a negativity so negative\nthat it could not even be called such any longer. Negativity has always\nbeen determined by dialectics\u2014that is to say, by metaphysics\u2014as\nwork in the service of the constitution of meaning. To af\ufb01rm negativity\nin silence is to gain access to a nonclassical type of dissociation\nbetween thought and language. And perhaps to a dissociation of\nthought and philosophy as discourse, if we are conscious of the fact\nthat this schism cannot be enunciated, thereby erasing itself, except\nwithin philosophy.\n5.

I have consistently translated \u0153uvre as \u201cwork\u201d throughout this\nessay to avoid confusions that could be caused by translating it as\n\u201cwork of art,\u201d as Howard does. To translate Foucault\u2019s de\ufb01nition of\nmadness, commented upon by Derrida, as \u201cthe absence of the work of\nart\u201d (l\u2019absence d\u2019\u0153uvre) does not convey Foucault\u2019s sense of the\nabsence of a work governed by institutionalized rationalism.\n7. TN. Derrida is making use of the fact that the word \u00e9loge (praise) is\nderived from the same word as \u201clogos.\u201d\n8. Foucault, Folie et d\u00e9raison, p. xi.\n9.
