The question now arises: How is this positive science, with \nits specific positive and scientific character, related to philosophy? \nc) THE RELATION OF THEOLOGY, \nAS A POSITIVE SCIENCE, TO PHILOSOPHY \nIf faith does not need philosophy, the science of faith as a positive science \ndoes. And here again we must distinguish: The positive science of faith \ndoes not need philosophy for the founding and primary disclosure of its \npositum, Christianness, which founds itself in its own maner. The positive \nscience of faith needs philosophy only in regard to its scientific character, \nand even then only in a uniquely restricted, though basic, way. \nAs a science theology places itself under the claim that its concepts show \nand are appropriate to the being that it has undertaken to interpret. But is \nit not the case that that which is to be interpreted in theological concepts is \nprecisely that which is disclosed only through, for, and in faith? Is not that \nwhich is supposed to be grasped conceptually here something essentially \ninconceivable, and consequently something whose content is not to be \nfathomed, and whose legitimacy is not to be founded, by purely rational \nmeans? \nNevertheless, something can very well be inconceivable and never pri\u00ad\nmarily disclosable through reason without thereby excluding a conceptual \ngrasp of itself. On the contrary: if its inconceivability as such is indeed to be \ndisclosed properly, it can only be by way of the appropriate conceptual in\u00ad\nterpretation - and that means pushing such interpretation to its very limits. \nOtherwise the inconceivability remains, as it were, mute. Yet this interpre\u00ad\ntation of faithful existence is the task of theology. And so, why philosophy? \n\\Vhatever is discloses itself only on the grounds of a preliminary (although \nnot explicitly known), preconceptual understanding of what and how such \na being is. Every ontic interpretation operates on the basis, at first and for \nthe most part concealed, of an ontology.

Is faith to become the criterion of \nknowledge for an ontological-philosophical explication? Are not the basic \ntheological concepts completely withdrawn from philosophical-ontological \nreflection? \nOf course one should not lose sight here of something essential: the \nexplication of basic concepts, insofar as it proceeds correctly, is never ac\u00ad\ncomplished by explicating and defining isolated concepts with reference to \nthemselves alone and then operating with them here and there as if they \nwere playing chips. Rather, all such explication must take pains to envision \nand hold constantly in view in its original totality the primary, self-contained \nontological context to which all the basic concepts refer. What does this \nmean for the explication of basic theological concepts? \nWe characterized faith as the essential constitutive element of Christian\u00ad\nness: faith is rebirth. Though faith does not bring itself about, and though \nwhat is revealed in faith can never be founded by way of a rational knowing \nas exercised by autonomously functioning reason, nevertheless the sense of \nthe Christian occurrence as rebirth is that Dasein's prefaithful, i.e., unbe\u00ad\nlieving, existence is sublated [aufgehoben] therein. Sublated does not mean \ndone away with, but raised up, kept, and preserved in the new creation. \nOne's pre-Christian existence is indeed existentielly, onticaUy, overcome \nin faith. But this existentiell overcoming of one's pre-Christian existence \n(which belongs to faith as rebirth) means precisely that one's overcome \npre-Christian Dasein is existentially, ontologically included within faithful \nexistence. To overcome does not mean to dispose of, but to have at one's \ndisposition in a new way. Hence we can say that precisely because all basic \ntheological concepts, considered in their full regional context, include a \ncontent that is indeed existentielly powerless, i.e., ontically sublated, they \nare ontologically determined by a content that is pre-Christian and that can \nthus be grasped purely rationally. All theological concepts necessarily con\u00ad\ntain that understanding of being that is constitutive of human Dasein as \nsuch, insofar as it exists at all.1 Thus, for example, sin is manifest only in \nfaith, and only the believer can factically exist as a sinner. But if sin, which \nis the counterphenomenon to faith as rebirth and hence a phenomenon of \nexistence, is to be interpreted in theological concepts, then the co,ltent of \nthe concept itself, and not just any philosophical preference of the theolo\u00ad\ngian, calls for a return to the concept of guilt. \nBut guilt is an original \nontological determination of the existence of Dasein.l The more originally \nand appropriately the basic constitution of Dasein is brought to light in \na genuine ontological manner and the more originally, for example, the \n5 1 \n"

As ontology, philosophy does \nprovide the possibility of being employed by theology as a corrective, in the \nsense we have discussed, if indeed theology is to be factical with respect to \nthe facticity of faith. The demand, however, that it must be so employed \nis not made by philosophy as such but rather by theology, insofar as it un\u00ad\nderstands itself to be a science. In summary, then, the precise formulation is: \nPhilosophy is the possible, fonnally indicative ontological cOTective of the on tic \nand, in partimlar, of the pre-Christian content of basic theological concepts. But \nphilosophy can be what it is without functioningfactically as this corrective. \nThis peculiar relationship does not exclude but rather includes the fact \nthat faith, as a specific possibility of existence, is in its innermost core the \nmortal enemy of the fon of existence that is an essential part of philosophy \nand that is factically ever-changing ...

Outside this \nfield thinking and speaking are by no means objectifying. \nBut today there is a growing danger that the scientific-technological \nmanner of thinking will spread to all realms of life.

Neither a disposition nor \na process is meant, rather a letting something be taken on (namely, taken \nupon oneself), a being set on oneself (as in the idiom \"he is set on it\"), a \ntaking it on oneself. \nOf itself, drive characteristically leads into activity, not just occasionally \nbut [3 76] essentially. This leading into requires no prior external stimulus. \nDrive is the impulse that in its very essence is self-propulsive. The phe\u00ad\nnomenon of drive not only brings along with it, as it were, the cause, in the \nsense of release, but drive is as such always already released. It is triggered, \nhowever, in such a way that it is still always tensed. Drive can indeed be \ninhibited in its thrust, but even as inhibited it is not the same as a static \ncapacity for acting. Eliminating whatever inhibits it can nevertheless first \nallow the thrust to become free. The disappearance of whatever inhibits it, \nor, to use Max Scheler's felicitous expression, disinhibition [Enthemmung], \nis something other than an additional cause coming from outside. Leibniz \nsays: \"Atque ita per se ipsam in operationem fertur; nee auxiliis indiget, \nsed sola sublatione impedimenti\" [It is thus carried into action by itself and \nneeds no help, but only the removal of an impediment) (ibid.). The image \nof a bent bow illustrates his meaning. The expression \"force\" can therefore \neasily lead us astray, because it suggests the idea of a static property. \nAfter this clarification of vis activa as drive, Leibniz arrives at the essen\u00ad\ntial definition: \"Et hanc agendi virtutem omni substantiae inesse ajo, sem\u00ad\nperque aliquam ex ea actionem nasci\": I say that this power of acting inheres \nin every substance (constitutes its substantiality) and that some action al\u00ad\nways arises from it (ibid., 4 70). In other words, it is drive and is productive. \nProdu.ce1\u00b7e means: to lead something forth, to let it come out of itself and to \nmaintain this outcome in itself.

Leibniz describes vis aaiva also as \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La, with reference \nto Aristode (cf., for instance, the New System, \u00a73). In the Monadolog;y (\u00a7IS) \nhe adds the explanation for this designation: \"car elles ant en elles une \ncenaine perfection (lxo\u2022JaL 'to \u00a3v't\u00a3AEc;)\": for they have in them a certain \nperfection, in a certain manner they carry within them a completeness, \ninsofar as each monad (as will be shown later) brings its positive content \nalready with it, and brings it in such a way that this content is potentially \nthe universe itself. \nThis construal of \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La does not conform to Aristode's real inten\u00ad\ntion. On the other hand, by giving it new meaning, Leibniz claims this very \nterm for his monadology. \nAlready in the Renaissance \u00a3v't\u00a3AtX\u00a3La was translated in the Leibnizian \nsense with peifectibabia; the Monadology, in \u00a748, names Hermolaus Barbarus \nthe translator of the term. In the Renaissance, Hermolaus Barbarus trans\u00ad\nlated and commented on Aristode and on the commentary of Themistius \n(pcr-390), and he did so in order to restore the Greek Aristode against me\u00ad\ndieval Scholasticism. Naturally his task harbored considerable difficulties. \nThe story goes that, compelled by his perplexity over the philosophical \nmeaning of the term tv\"t\u00a3AtX\u00a3La, he invoked the Devil to provide him with \ninstruction. \nAt this point we have explained, in general, the concept of vis activo: \n(I) vis activo means \"drive.\" ( 2) This drive is supposed to be inherent in every \nsubstance as substance. (3) Some accomplishing or carrying out continually \narises from drive. \nBut now we are just coining to the real metaphysical problem of substan\u00ad\ntiality, to the question about the unity of substance as that which primarily \nis. Leibniz calls that which is not substance a \"phenomenon,\" something \nderivative, a surplus. \nThe unity belonging to the monads is not the result of an accumula\u00ad\ntion, a subsequent addition; rather, the unity is to be found in that which \nconfers unity in advance. Unity as the conferral of unity is active, 13 79] vis \naaiva, drive as the primum constitutivum of the unity of substance. Herein \nlies the central problem of the monadology, the problem of drive and of \nmbstantiality. \nThe fundamental character of this activity has now come into view. It \nremains to be seen how drive should itself be unity-conferring. A further \nquestion of decisive importance is: On the basis of this intrinsically unitary \n"

We emphasized sev\u00ad\neral times that we can find the metaphysical meaning of the monadology \nonly when we venture to construct essential connections and perspectives, \nand when we do so by following that which directed Leibniz himself in \nprojecting the monadology. \nThe monadology tries to clarify the being of beings. Hence a paradig\u00ad\nmatic idea of being must be obtained somewhere. Such an idea has been \nfound where something like being manifests itself immediately to the one \nasking philosophical questions. We comport ourselves toward beings, be\u00ad\ncome involved with and lose ourselves in them; we are overwhelmed and \ncaptivated by beings. Yet not only do we relate to beings, but we are likewise \nourselves beings. This we each are, and we are so, not indifferently, but in \nsuch a way that our very own being is a concern for us. Aside from other \nreasons, one's own being as that of the questioner is therefore in a certain \nway always the guiding thread: so too in projecting the monadology. What \nis thereby seen in advance, however, remains uninterrogated ontologically. \nConstant regard for our own existence [Dasein], for the ontological con\u00ad\nstitution and manner of being of one's own \"I,\" provides Leibniz with the \nmodel of the unity he attributes to every being. This becomes clear in \nmany passages. Clarity about this guiding thread is of decisive importance \nfor understanding the monadology. \nDe plus, par le moyen de l'ame ou forme, il y a une veritable unite qui repond a ce \nqu'on appelle MOl en nous; ce qui ne (JSO] sauroit avoir lieu ni dans les machines \nde I' art, ni dans Ia simple masse de Ia matiere, quelque organisee qu'elle puisse etre; \nqu'on ne peut considerer que comme une armee ou un troupeau, ou comme un \netang plein de poissons, ou comme une montre composee de ressorts et de roues. \nBy means of regarding the \"soul\" or the \"form\" there results the idea of a true unity \ncorresponding to what in us is called the \"I\"; such a unity could not occur in artificial \nmachines or in a simple mass of matter as such, however organized (formed) it may \nbe.

In the letter to de Voider cited above, \nLeibniz continues: \nSi nihil sua natura activum est, nihil omnino activum erit; quae enim tandem ratio \nactionis si non in natura rei? Limitationem tamen adjicis, ut res SUI1 natura activa ese \npossit, si actio semper se habeat eodem motk. Sed cum omnis actio mutationem con\u00ad\ntineat, ergo habemus quae negare videbaris, tendentiam ad mutationem internam, \net temporale sequens ex rei natura. \n[If nothing is active by its own nature, there will be nothing active at all, for what \nreason for activity can there be if not in the nature of a thing? Yet you add the \nrestriction that \"a thing can be active by its own nature, if its action always maintains \nitself in the same mode.\" But since every action contains change, we must have in \nit precisely what you would seem to deny it, namely, a tendency toward internal \nchange and a temporal succession following from the nature of the thing.] \nHere it is stated clearly that the activity of the monad as drive is in itself \ndrive toward change. \nDrive, of its very nature, drives on to something else; it is self-surpass\u00ad\ning drive. This means that a manifold arises in the driving thing itself, as \ndriving. Substance is given over to successioni obnoxia, successiveness. As \ndrive, drive delivers itself to succession, not as if to something other than \nitself, but as to that which belongs to it. That which drive seeks to press \nupon submits itself to temporal succession. The manifold is not something \nalien to it; rather, drive is this manifold itself. \nIn drive itself there resides a tendency toward transition from something \nto something. This tendency toward transition is what Leibniz means by \nappetitus. Appetitus and perceptio, in the sense characterized, are equipri\u00ad\nmordial features of the monad. The tendency is itself pre-hending. This \nmeans that it unifies from a unity that surpasses in advance, unifying the \ntransitions from prehension to prehension, transitions that are driven on \nin the drive and that drive themselves on. \"lmo rem accurate considerando \ndicendwn est nihil in rebus esse nisi substantias simplices et in his percep\u00ad\ntionem atque appetitum\" [Indeed, considering the matter carefully, it may \nbe said that there is nothing in the world except simple substances and, in \nthem, perception and appetite] (letter to de Voider, G.

Perceptio and appetitus are \ntherefore determined in their activity of drive primarily in terms of the \nviewpoint. \nYet herein lies something that has not yet been conceived explicitly: \nSomething that, like drive, is in itself a reaching out - and indeed in such a \nway that it is and maintains itself in this very reaching out - has in itself the \npossibility of grasping itself. In driving toward, that which drives always \ntraverses a dimension. That is, that which drives traverses itself and is in \nthis way open to itself, and is able to be so by its very essence. \nBecause of this dimensional self-openness, that which drives can there\u00ad\nfore expressly grasp its own self; i.e., in addition to perceiving, it can also \npresent itself at the same time along with its perceiving. It can perceive \nitself concomitantly (ad): it can apperceive. In Principles of Nature and of \nGrace, \u00a74, Leibniz writes: \nAinsi il est bon de faire distinction entre Ia Perception qui est l'etat interieur de Ia \nMonade representant les choses extemes, et /'Apperception qui est Ia Conscience, ou \nIa connaissance reflexive de cet etat interieur, laquelle n'est point donnee a toutes \nles Ames, ny tousjours a Ia meme Arne. \n[So it is well to make a distinction between perception, which is the inner state of the \nmonad representing external things, and apperception, which is consdoumess or the \nreflective knowledge of this inner state itself and which is not given to all souls nor \nto the same soul all the time.) (G. VI, 6o; cf. M011\u00ae/ogy, \u00a72 Iff.) \nIn this viewpoint the whole universe is, as it were, held in view - in a \nparticular perspective of beings and of the possible in each case. But the \nview is refracted in a particular way, namely, in each case according to the \nmonad's stage of drive. That is, it is refracted in each case according to \nthe monad's possibility for unifying itself in its manifoldness. From this it \nbecomes clear [392] that a certain co-presentation of itself is found in the \nmonad as prehensive drive. \nThis unveiling of self can have various degrees, from full transparency \nto insensibility and captivated distraction. No monad lacks perceptio and ap\u00ad\npetiNIS and thus a certain accompanying openness to itself (though this need \nnot be full self-apprehension), if only of the lowest degree. Accordingly, \nthe particular viewpoint, and the correlative possibility of unification, its \nunity, is that which individuates each and every monad. \n"

Yet, in individuation, in the drive from its own particular perspective, \nthe monad unifies the universe prehended in advance only according to the \npossibility of its own perspective. Each monad is thus in itself a mundus \nconcentratus. Every drive concentrates in itself, in its driving, the world in \neach case after its own fashion. \nBut because each monad, in a way of its own, is the world insofar as \nit presents the world, every drive is in consensus with the universe. Be\u00ad\ncause of the consonance [Ein.rtimigkeit] every prehensive drive has with \nthe universe, the monads themselves are also interconnected with one an\u00ad\nother. The idea of the monad as prehensive drive tending toward transition \nimplies that the world belongs in each case to the monad in a perspecti\u00ad\nval refraction, that all monads as units of drive are thus oriented in ad\u00ad\nvance toward a predisposed harmony of the totality of beings: harmqnia \npraestabilita. \nAs the fundamental structure of the actual world, of the actualia, however, \nharmonia praestabilita is that which, as the goal of drive [das Erdriingte), \nstands opposite the central monad, God. God's drive is his will. But the \ncorrelate of divine will is the optimum, \"distinguendum enim inter ea, quae \nDeus potest, et quae vult: potest omnia, vult optima. Actualia nihil aliud \nsunt, quam possibilium (omnibus comparatis) optima; Possibilia sunt quae \nnon implicant contradictionem\" [we must distinguish between the things \nthat God can do and those that he wills to do; he can do all things, but he \nwills the best. Actual things are nothing but the best of possibles, all things \nconsidered. Possible things are those that do not imply a contradiction] \n{letter to Johann Bernoulli, February 2 I, I699; S. II, I I). \n[393] In every monad the whole universe is potentially present. The \nindividuation that takes place in drive as unifying is thus always essentially \nthe individuating of a being that belongs, as monad, to the world. Mo\u00ad\nnads are not isolated pieces producing the world by being added together. \nEach monad, as the drive we have characterized, is in each case and in \nits own way the universe itself. Drive is pre-hensive drive that in each \ncase presents the world from a viewpoint. Every monad is a little world, a \nmicrocosm. This way of speaking does not touch the essential, inasmuch \nas each monad is the universe in such a way that, in its driving, it in each \ncase apprehends the whole world in its unity, although it never comprehends \nit totally. Each monad is, according to its particular level of awakeness, a \nworld history that presents the world. Thus the universe is, in a certain \nsense, multiplied by as many times as there are monads, just as the same \n79 \n"

The monad \nis a living mi11\u00b7or of the univene. \nOne of the most important passages is contained in the letter to de Voider \nfromjune 20, 1 703: \nEntelechias differre necesse est, seu non esse penitus similes inter se, imo principia \nesse diversitatis, nam aliae aliter exprimunt universum ad suum quaeque spectandi \nmodum, idque ipsarum officium est ut sint totidem specula vitalia rerum seu totidem \nMundi concentrati. \nIt is necessary that the entelechies (monads) differ from one another or not be \ncompletely similar to each other. In fact, they (themselves as such) must be the \nprinciples of diversity, for each expresses the universe differently in accordance with \nits own way of seeing (pre-hending). And precisely this is their most proper task, \nthat they should be so many living mirrors of that which is, or so many concentrated \nworlds. (G. IT, z.sr/sz.) \n[394) This statement contains several points: \n( 1) The differentiation of monads is necessary; it belongs to their es\u00ad\nsence. In unifying, each unifies from its own viewpoint, and thus they indi\u00ad\nviduate themselves. \n(2) On account of their way of seeing, perceptio - appetitus, monads are \nthus themselves the origin of their diversity in each case. \n(3) This unifying presentation [Dar-stellen) of the universe in each in\u00ad\ndividuation is precisely what concerns each monad as such in its being (its \ndrive). \n(4) Monads are each the universe in concentrated form. The center \nof concentration is drive determined from a particular viewpoint in each \ninstance: concentrationes tmiveni (G. II, 2 78). \n(5) The monad is speculum vitale [a living mirror] (cf. Principles of Na\u00ad\nture and of Grace, \u00a73; Monadology, \u00a7\u00a763 and 77; and the letter to Remond, \nG. III, 62 3). Mirror, speculum, means a letting-be-seen: miroir adif indivis\u00ad\nible (G. rv, 557; S. I, 146), an actively driving, indivisible, simple mirroring. \nThis letting-be-seen first comes about in the manner of the monad's being, \nwhereby a particular unveiling of world transpires. Mirroring is not a fixed \ncopying, but itself drives as such toward new predelineated possibilities of \nitself. The mirror is simple because it possesses in advance the one universe \nwithin a single viewpoint from which the manifold first becomes visible. \nFrom this we can grasp more sharply the essence of finite substance \nfrom an aspect we have not yet considered. Leibniz says in his letter to de \n8o \n"

II, 249): \"omnis substantia est activa, et omnis \nsubstantia finita est passiva, passioni autem connexa resistentia est.\" [Every \nsubstance is active and every finite substance is passive, and connected with \nthis passivity is resistance.] What is this supposed to mean? \nInsofar as the monad is always the whole within a single viewpoint, the \ngrounds of its finitude lie precisely in its being related to the order of the \nuniverse in this way. The monad relates to a resistance, to something it \nis not but could well be. Drive is indeed active, yet in every finite drive \noccurring in a particular [395] perspective, there is always and necessarily \nsomething resistant, something that opposes the drive as such. For insofar \nas it is driving from a particular viewpoint toward the whole universe in \neach case, there are many things that the drive is not. The drive is modified \nby the viewpoint. We must heed the fact that drive as an active driving is \nrelated to resistance precisely because such drive can be the whole universe \npotentially but in fact is not. This passivity, in the sense of what the drive \ndoes not attain in its driving [erdriingt], belongs to the finitude of drive. \nThis negative aspect, purely as a sttuctural moment of finite drive, char\u00ad\nacterizes the nature of what Leibniz understands by materia prima. He \nwrites to des Bosses: \nMateria prima cuilibet Entelechiae est essentialis, neque unquam ab ea separatur, \ncum earn compleat et sit ipsa potentia passiva totius substantiae completae. Neque \nenim materia prima in mole seu impenetrabilitate et extensione consistit . . .  \n[Prime matter is essential for any entelechy, nor can it ever be separated from it \nsince it completes the entelechy and is the passive power itself of the total complete \nsubstance. For prime matter does not consist in mass nor in impenetrability and \nextension . . .  ] (G. ll, 314) \nBecause of this essential primordial passivity, the monad has the intrin\u00ad\nsic possibility of nerus with materia secunda, i.e., with massa, with definite \nresistance in the sense of material mass and weight. (Cf. on this Leibniz's \ncorrespondence with the mathematician Bernoulli and with the Jesuit des \nBosses, professor of philosophy and theology at the Jesuit college in Hil\u00ad\ndesheim.) \nThis structural moment of passivity provides Leibniz with the founda\u00ad\ntion for making metaphysically intelligible the nerus of the monad with a \nmaterial body (materia secunda, massa) and for demonstrating positively why \nextensio cannot constitute the essence of material substance as Descartes had \ntaught. We cannot pursue this here, however, nor can we go into the further \ndevelopment of the monadology or the metaphysical principles connected \nwith it. \n8 1  \n"
