      "full_text": "The Supplement of Copula\nFirst, the thesis: \"Now it seems to us\u2014and we shall try to show\u2014that these\ndistinctions are primarily categories of language and that, in fact, Aristotle,\nreasoning in the absolute, is simply identifying certain fundamenta'l ca.tegories\nof the language m which he thought\" (p. 57).\nWhat are the presuppositions of this thesis? Benveniste starts from a certain\nnumber of generally acknowledged\u2014at least since Saussure\u2014characteristics of\nlanguage. In the first place, \"the reality of language\" is \"unconscious,\" which\nresembles Saussure's propositions concerning the fact that \"language is not a\nfunction of the speaking subject.\" We will not pause to consider this premise,\nwhich raises more than one difficulty, however, and not only because of its\nempirical form. (\"In their diversity, these uses [of language] have, however, two\ncharacteristics in common. One is that the reality of language, as a general rule,\nremains unconscious\"; p. 55.) What does \"reality of language\" mean here? What\nis the status of \"reality\" in the phrase \"reality of language\"? Why only \"as a\ngeneral rule\"? Is it or is it not an essential predicate of the so-called reality to\nremain unconscious? The difficulty of distinguishing conscious from uncon-\nscious is at its most obscure when the issue is one of language or of the use of\nlanguage. And the difficulty is not attenuated, quite to the contrary, when the\nunconscious risks becoming an indistinct consciousness (\"The reality of lan-\nguage, as a general rule, remains unconscious; except when language is espe-\ncially studied for itself, we have no more than a very faint and fleeting awareness\nof the operations which we accomplish in order to talk\"; p. 55), or when the\nactivity of linguistics, in its relation to language, is determined as a coming to,\nor an increase of, consciousness. These questions are raised neither to emphasize\nwhat are doubtless secondary links in Benveniste's demonstration, nor to object\nto his discourse, but merely to indicate an example of the aporias that appear\nto engage anyone who takes on the task of defining the constraints which limit\nphilosophical discourse; for it is from the latter that the noncritical notions which\nare applied to its delimitation must be borrowed. The notions of system, form,\ncontent, which serve to define the characteristics of language, equally could\nhave given us pause (\"Now this language has a configuration in all its parts\nand as a totality. It is in addition organized as an arrangement of distinct and\ndistinguishing 'signs,' capable themselves of being broken down into interior\nunits or of being grouped into complex units. This great structure, which includes\nsubstructures of several levels, gives its form to the content of thought\"; p. 55).\nThe notion of a linguistic system, even if opposed to the notions of logical system,\nor system of categories, and even if one attempted to reduce the latter to the\nformer, would never have been possible outside the history (and) of the concepts\nof metaphysics as theory, episteme, etc. Whatever the displacements, breaks, and\nsecondary discontinuities of every kind, (and they surely have to be taken very\nstrictly into account), this filiation has never been absolutely interrupted. Ben-\nveniste acknowledges this elsewhere:8 and here he acknowledges that he must\n8. Problems, p. 18: \"Everyone knows that western linguistics originated in Greek phi-\nlosophy.

The category is one of- the ways\nfor \"Being\" to say itself or to signify itself, that is, to open language to its\nexterior, to what is in that it is or such as it is, to truth. \"Being\" is given in\nlanguage, precisely, as that which opens language to nonlanguage, beypnd what\nwould be only the (\"subjective,\" \"empirical,\" in the anachronistic sense of these\nwords) interior of a language. It is evident\u2014and Benveniste formulates this\nexplicitly\u2014that to reduce the categories of thought to categories of language is\nto affirm that a language's pretentions to \"thought,\" that is, to truth, universality,\nthe ontological, are unjustifiable. But as it happens, the category of the category\nis but a systematic setting in place of the pretension to an exterior of language,\nmaking it both language and thought because language is examined at the site\nwhere the signification \"Being\" is produced.\nAmong the several presentations of the categories, the most complete list is\nprobably the one cited by Benveniste (Categories, chap. 4, 1, b 25). But the text\nof the Metaphysics (E 2 1026 a 33), which also proposes a list of the categories,\nprecedes this list with a kind of principial definition. The categories answer the\nquestion of knowing in what ways Being is said, since it is said pollakOs, in many\nways: \"The science which studies this will be prior to physics, and will be\nprimary philosophy and universal in this sense, that it is primary. And it will\nbe the province of this science to study Being qua Being (kai pen tou ontos liii on,\ntaut\u00ebs an eu theoresai); what it is (ti esti), and what the attributes are which belong\nto it qua Being (kai ta huparkhonta hei on). But since the simple term 'being' (to\nhaplOs legomenon: Haplos: simply, frankly, in a word, without detour) is used in\nvarious senses (pollakOs legetai'), of which we saw that one was accidental (kata\nsumbeb\u00e9kos), and another true (Os al\u00ebthes), not-being being used in the sense of\nfalse (kai to me on Os to pseudos); and since besides these there are the categories\n(ta skh\u00ebmata t\u00ebs kategorias), e.g. the 'what' (ti), quality (poion), quantity (poson),\nplace (pou), time (pote), and any other similar meanings (ei ti allo\nton\ntropon touton).\"\u00b0\nThus, Aristotle knows that he is examining the ways of saying11 being in that\nit is pollakOs legomenon. The categories are the figures (skh\u00ebmata) according to\nwhich the \"simple term\" being is said in that it is said in several ways, through\nseveral tropes.

Conversely,\nAristotle nowhere presents the categories as properties of things or as laws of thought.\nTherefore, one cannot impute to Aristotle an alleged 'unconsciousness' of the relations\nbetween his ontology and language.\"\n183\n"

The enormousness of this task does not\nreduce its necessity. This is why, above all, we are not trying to gainsay the\nquestion asked by Benveniste, quite the contrary; we are, rather, attempting to\nanalyze certain of its presuppositions, and perhaps to pursue, however mini-\nmally, its elaboration.\nNot only has Aristotle's empiricism been delineated, or allegedly so, but quite\nprecisely, and of long date, his categories have been recognized as productions\nof language. The most precise and systematic attempt here was Trendelenburg's\n(1846). \" As Aubenque\" also recalls, Benveniste has an immediate predecessor,\nwhom at times he even seems to paraphrase, in the person of Brunschvicg. In\nhis Les Ages de l'infelligence (1939), Brunschvicg also accused Aristotle of taking\n\"the universe of discourse\" for \"the universe of reason;' believing that thereby\nhe could unmask \"the entirely verbal character of his ontology,\" \"and doubtless\nof every ontology,\" for \"Being as Being is the kind of word that cannot be more\nthan a word.\" \"He [Aristotlej seeks knowledge of things only in sensory per-\nception. . . and in language, or, more accurately, in the language that he spoke,\nwhose particularities he unconsciously [my italics] elevates into the necessary and\nuniversal conditions of thought.\"7 Which means, as Brunschvicg says elsewhere\nciting Serrus, that Aristotle would only have \"made explicit a certain sponta-\nneous metaphysics of the Greek language.\" Aubenque further cites a thesis of\nRougier's: \"Bergson said that Aristotle's metaphysics is the spontaneous me-\ntaphysics of the human mind: it would be more correct to say that it is the\nspontaneous metaphysics of the Indo-European languages, and of the Greek\nlanguage in particular.\"8\nCassirer, who has never been cited in this debate, is surely Benveniste's most\nremarkable and immediate predecessor. In \"The Influence of Language on the\nDevelopment of Thought in the Natural Sciences,\" he also recalls the previous\nattempts, notably Trendelenburg's: \"When Aristotle, in his analyses of the the-\nory of categories, follows language and commits himself to its guidance, there\nis nothing to discuss about his procedure, from a modern point of view.

Each of them is given by its designation and followed by its equivalent:\nousia ('substance'), substantive; poion, poson ('what kind, in what number'), ad-\njectives derived from pronouns like the Latin qualis and quantus; pros ti ('relating\nto what'), comparative adjective; pou ('where'), pote ('when'), adverbs of place\nand time; keisthai ('to be placed'), middle voice; ekhein ('to be in a state'), the\nperfect; poiein ('to do'), active voice; paskhein ('to undergo'), passive voice\" (p.\n60).\nThus, the linguist transcribes in terms of language what the philosopher pre-\nviously, \"unconsciously\" transposed, or projected from language into terms of\nthought:\n\"We have thus an answer to the question raised in the beginning which had\nled us to this analysis.

Thus, one cannot call translation the\npassage from a categorial (nonlinguistic) structure said to be of \"thought,\" to\na linguistic categorial structure said to be of \"language.\" The sense of \"tran-\nscription,\" therefore, refers back to what is called \"transposition\" or \"projection\"\nfurther on.

Is it not strange to qualify as empirical\nthe necessity of an expression, the necessity to bring the conceivable to statement\nin a given language?

Above all, how can one affirm the empiricity of the move-\nment which leads to signifying in general and to signifying within a language,\nand that does so with recourse to an organization of forms, a distribution of\ndasses, etc.?

Even if such a concept is not fixed once and for all in an \"origin,\" one\ncannot comprehend the history and system of its mutations or transformations\nwithout taking into account the general code of metaphysics, and within this\ncode, the decisive mark of Aristotelianism.

We understand 'Being' not in regard to\nthe 'thou art,' 'you are,' 'I am,' or 'they would be,' though all of these, just as\nmuch as 'is,' represent verbal inflections of 'to be.' 'To be' is for us the infinitive\nof 'is.' And involuntarily, almost as though nothing else were possible, we\nexplain the infinitive 'to be' to ourselves through the 'is.'\n\"Accordingly, 'Being' has the meaning indicated above, recalling the Greek\nview of the essence of Being (Wesen des Seins) hence a determinateness which\nhas not just dropped on us accidentally from somewhere but has dominated\nour historical Being-there (geschichtliches Dasein)\" (p\u2022 77).\nHowever eternally troubled and worked upon from within, the fusion of the\ngrammatical and lexical functions of \"to be\" certainly bears an essential relation\nto the history of metaphysics and to everything coordinated to this history in\nthe West.\nThere is a strong, indeed barely repressible, temptation to consider the grow-\ning predominance of the formal function of the copula as a process of falling,\nan abstraction, degradation, or emptying of the semantic plenitude of the lexeme\n\"to be\" and of all lexemes which, likewise, have let themselves dwindle or be\nreplaced. Is not to examine this \"history,\" (but the word \"history\" belongs to\nthis process of meaning), as the history of meaning, and to ask the \"question\nof Being\" as the question of the \"meaning of Being\" (Heidegger), to limit the\ndestruction of classical ontology to a reappropriation of the semantic plenitude\nof \"Being,\" a reactivation of the lost origin, etc.? Is it not to constitute the\nsupplement of copula as a historical accident, even if one considers it to be\nstructurally necessary? Is it not to suspect a kind of original fall in the copula,\nwith all that such a perspective would imply?\nFinally, why does the horizon of meaning dominate the question of the linguist\nas well as the question of the philosophical thinker? What desire impels both\nthe one and the other, as what they are, to proceed analogically toward a su-\nperlapsanan agency, something before the supplement of copula? That their\nprocedures and horizons remain analogous in this respect, one sees in the\nfollowing:\n\"The entire range of the inflections of the verb 'to be' (scm) is determined by\nthree different stems.\n\"The first two stems to be named are Indo-European and also occur in the\nGreek and Latin words for 'Being.'\n203\n"

Guided by the question of rhetoric, such an interpretation\nwould require examination of the texts of Renan0 and Nietzsche7 (who both, as\nphilologists, recalled what they considered to be the metaphorical origin of\nconcepts, and most notably of the concept which seems to support literal, proper\nmeaning, the propriety of the proper, Being), as well as those of Freud,8 Bergson,9\nand Lenin,'0 all of whom in_their attejnjyeness to metaphorical\nin the-\noretical or philosophical discourse, proposed or practiced the multiphcation of\nantagonistic\norder better to control or neutralize their effect.

To read within a concept the hidden history of a metaphor is to privilege\ndiachrony at the expense of system, and is also to invest in the symbolist conception\nof language that we have pointed out in passing: no matter how deeply buried,\nthe link of the signifier to the signified has had both to be and to remain a link\nof natural necessity, of analogical participation, of resemblance. Metaphor has\nalways been defined as the trope of resemblance; not simply as the resemblance\nbetween a signifier and a signified but as the resemblance between two signs,\none of which designates the other. This is the most general characteristic of\nmetaphor, which is what authorizes us to group under this heading all the so-\ncalled symbolical or analogical figures mentioned by Polyphios (figure, myth,\nfable, allegory). In this critique of philosophical language, to take an interest in\nmetaphor\u2014in this particular figure\u2014is therefore also to take a symbolist stand.\nIt is above all to take an interest in the nonsyntactic, nonsystematic pole of\nlanguage, that is, to take an interest in semantic \"depth,\" in the magnetic at-\ntraction of the similar, rather than in positional combinations, which we may\ncall \"metonymic\" in the sense defined by Jakobson,\" who indeed emphasizes\nthe affinity between the predominance of the metaphorical, i.e. symbolism (as\nmuch, we would say, as a literary school as a linguistic conception)\u2014and ro-\nmanticism (as more historical, that is, historicist, and more hermeneutical). It\ngoes without saying that far from belonging to this problematic and sharing its\npresuppositions, the question of metaphor, such as we are repeating it here, on\nthe contrary should delimit them. However, the issue is not, symmetrically, to\nreaffirm what Polyphilos chooses as his target; it is rather to deconstruct the\nmetaphysical and rhetorical schema at work in his critique, not in order to reject\nand discard them but to reinscribe them otherwise, and especially in order to\nbegin to identify, the historico-problematic terrain on which philosophy system-\natically has been asked for the metaphorical rubrics of its concepts.\n3. The value of usure also has to be subjected to interpretation. It seems to\nhave a systematic tie to the metaphorical\npective. It will be rediscovered\nwherever the theme of metaphor is privileged. And it is also a metaphor that\nimplies a continuist presupposition:\nof a metaphor appears essentially\nnot asa displacement with breaks, as\nsystem,\nmutations, separations without origin, but rather as a\na.\nloss ap_uninterriijted exhausting of the prinutive meaning\nan empirical abstraction without extraction from its own native soil. Not that\nthe enterprise of the authors cited is entirely covered by this presupposition,\nbut, rather, the enterprise recurs to it every time it gives the metaphorical point\nof view the upper hand.

Supposing that we might reach it (touch it,\nsee it, comprehend it?), this tropic and prephilosophical resource could not have\nof a proper\nthe virginity of a history of be-\ngrnnmgs. And we know already that it could derive neither from a rhetoric of\nphilosophy nor from a meta philosophy analogous to what Bachelard, in his psy-\nchoanalysis of material imagination, called meta-poetics. We know this, already,\non the basis of the law of supplementaritj(between the concept and the field)\nviewed in its formal necessity. Provisionally, let us take this law for a hypothesis.\nIn attempting to verify it in several \"examples,\" perhaps we might, at the same\ntime, fill the concept of metaphor, following its entire tradition, a tradition which\nis as much philosophical as rhetorical, and might also recognize, at the same\ntime as the rule of its transformations, the limit of its plasticity.\n229\n"

      "full_text": "The Ellipsis of the Sun\nalthough not in a direct line, and with all kinds of divisions and inequalities of\ntransformation, from Aristotle or the Middle Ages. Here, we are being led back\nto the program, still entirely to be elaborated, of a new delimitation of bodies\nof work and of a new problematic of the signature.\nThere is a code or a program\u2014a rhetoric, if you will\u2014for every discourse on\nmetaphor: following custom, in the first place the Aristotelian definition must be\nrecalled, at least the one in the Poetics (145Th). We will not fail to do so. Certainly,\nAristotle invented neither the word nor the concept of metaphor. However, he\nseems to have proposed the first systematic situating of it, which in any event\nhas been retained as such with the most powerful historical effects. It is indis-\npensable to study the terrain on which the Aristotelian definition could have\nbeen constructed. But this study would lose all pertinence if it were not preceded,\nor in any event controlled, by the systematic and internal reconstitution of the\ntext to be reinscribed. Even if partial and preliminary the task is not limited to\na commentary on a textual surface. No transparency is granted it. The issue\nalready is one of an active interpretation setting to work an entire system of\nrules and anticipations.\n\"Metaphor (metaphora) consists in giving (epiphora)3' the thing a name (onon:-\natos) that belongs to something else (allotriou), the transference being either from\ngenus to species (apo tou genous epi eidos), or from species to genus (apo tou eidous\nepi to genos), or from species to species (apo tou eidous epi eidos), or on the grounds\nof analogy (e kata to analogon)\" (1457b6\u20149).\nThis definition, doubtless the most explicit, the most precise, and in any event\nthe most general,3' can be analyzed along two lines. It is a philosophical thesis\n35. TN. Demda's citation of the Greek terms is particularly important here. The French\ntranslation of epiphora as \"transport\" preserves a \"metaphoric\" play on words that is lost\nin the English rendering \"giving.\" Meta-phora and epi-phora have the same root, from the\nGreek pherein, to carry, to transport.\n36. This generality poses problems which recently have been reactivated in a way, as\nis well known. We will come back to them in our conclusion. In any event, Aristotle is\nthe first to consider metaphor as the general form of all the figures of words, whether\nmetaphor includes them (as in these examples of transport by metonymy or synecdoche),\nconstitutes their economy (abridged comparison), or finds its own best form in the analogy\nof proportionality (Rhetoric Ill). Doubtless this generality is proportional to the impover-\nishment of the determination of metaphor. Aristotle, from early on, was accused or excused\nfor this. \"Some Ancients have condemned Aristotle for putting under the name of met-\naphor the first two, which properly are but synecdoches; but Aristotle spoke in general,\nand he was writing at a time when there was still no refinement of figures, both in order\nto distinguish them and in order to give to each the name which would have best explained\nits nature. Cicero justifies Aristotle sufficiently when he writes in his De Oratore: Itaque\ngenus hoc Graeci appellant allegoricum, nonzine recte, genere melius ille (Aristoteles) qui ista omnia\ntranslationes vocal.\" Andr\u00e9 Dacier, Introduction a la po\u00e9tique d'Aristote, 1733. Hugh Blair:\n\"Aristotle, in his Poetics, uses Metaphor in this extended sense, for any figurative meaning\nimposed upon a word; as a whole put for the part, or a part for the whole; a species for\nthe genus, or a genus for the species. But it would be unjust to tax this most acute writer\nwith any inaccuracy on this account; the minute subdivisions, and various names of\nTropes, being unknown in his days, and the invention of later rhetoricians.\" Lectures on\nRhetoric and Belles Lettres XV, \"Metaphor.\"\n231\n"

      "full_text": "The Ellipsis of the Sun\nresemblance consist in presenting an idea under the sign of another idea that is more'\nstriking or better known, and which, moreover, has no other tie to the first idea than that\nof a certain conformity or analogy. As a genre these tropes can be reduced to a\nsingle one, Metaphor, whose name, which is so well known, and perhaps better\nknown than the thing itself, has lost, as Laharpe observes, all its scholarly\nimport. Metaphor is not ordinarily distinguished into species, like Metonymy and\nSynecdoche; however it must not be thought that it has but a single form, a single\naspect, and that it is the same in every case. On the contrary, it is quite varied,\nand doubtless extends further than Metonymy and Synecdoche, for not only the\nnoun, but further the adjective, the participle, the verb, and finally all species\nof words belong to its domain. Thus all species of words can be employed, or\nin effect are employed, metaphorically, if not as figures, at least as catachreses. The\nspecies of words capable of being employed metaphorically asfigures are the noun,\nthe adjective, the participle, the verb, and perhaps also the adverb, although\nrather rarely\" (p. 99).\nNow, on the one hand, everything excluded from this list of words is reserved\nfor the catachresis of metaphor, a \"not true figure,\" which \"embraces in its\nextension even the interjection.\" (\"There are even very few words, in each\nspecies, not under its domination,\" p. 215. We will come back to this problem\nlater.) True metaphor, therefore, keeps within the limits of the Aristotelian\n\"noun.\" Which, on the other hand, appears to be confirmed throughout the\nentire system of distinctions proposed by Fontanier in his general definition of\nwords. Among these words corresponding to \"ideas of an object\"\u2014which nat-\nurally can be nominalized.\u2014are dassed nouns, all words \"employed substan-\ntively\" (the beautiful, the true, the just; eating, drinking, sleeping; the for, the against;\nthe front, the back; the why, the how; the inside, the outside; the huts, the ifs, the whys,\nthe wherefores), and active or passive participles. The first group corresponds to\nsubstantive ideas of object, and the second to concrete ideas of object. Among the\nwords corresponding to the \"ideas of relationship\" are classed the verb (\"But\nby verb, here, I understand only the properly named verb, the verb to be, called\nof a \"comparison which is in the mind.\" It remains that Aristotle made of metaphor a\nrather extended genre, as we have seen, in order to cover every other nominal figure,\nincluding metonymy; that Fontanier restricts the field of metaphor (and therefore of anal-\nogy or of resemblance) in order to oppose it to metonymy; and that Du Marsais at first,\nby etymology, had loosened the limits of metonymy: \"The word rnetonvmy signifies trans-\nposition or changing of name, one name for another. In this sense, this figure includes\nall the other Tropes; for in all Tropes, a word not being taken in the meaning proper to\nit, it awakens an idea that might be expressed by another word. In what follows, we will\nnotice what properly distinguishes metonymy from the other Tropes. The masters of the\nart restrict metonymy to the following uses:\" (Du Marsais, II, 2). Condilac (whose phi-\nlosophy, more than any other, or at least like every other, might be considered as a treatise\non analogy) advances a symmetrically inverse proposition: \"What we have said of com-\nparisons must be applied to metaphors. I will bring to your attention only that if one\nconsults etymology, all tropes are metaphors: for metaphor properly signifies a word\ntransported from one meaning to an other\" (Dc l'art d'\u00e9crire II, vi).\n235\n"
