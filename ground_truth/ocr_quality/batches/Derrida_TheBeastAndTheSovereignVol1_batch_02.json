      "full_text": "28  \u2021  first session\nArt goes yet further, imitating that Rationall and most excellent work of \nNature, Man. For by art is created that great leviathan, called a common-\n wealth or state, (in latine civitas) which is but an Arti\ufb01 ciall Man; though \nof greater stature and strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and \ndefence it was intended; and in which, the Soveraignty is an Arti\ufb01 ciall Soul, \nas giving life and motion to the whole body; The Magistrates, and other Of-\n\ufb01 cers of Judicature and Execution, arti\ufb01 ciall Joynts; Reward and Punishment \n(by which fastned to the seate of the Soveraignty, every joint and member is \nmoved to performe his duty) are the Nerves.\nLet me interrupt the quotation for a moment to emphasize two points. On \nthe one hand, sovereignty is the arti\ufb01 cial soul: the soul, i.e. the principle of \nlife, life, vitality, vivacity of this Leviathan, and so also of the state, of this \nstate monster created and dominated by the art of man, arti\ufb01 cial animal \nmonster which is none other than arti\ufb01 cial man, says Hobbes, and which \nlives as a republic, state, commonwealth, civitas only through this sover-\neignty. This sovereignty is like an iron lung, an arti\ufb01 cial respiration, an \n\u201cArti\ufb01 ciall Soul.\u201d So the state is a sort of robot, an animal monster, which, in \nthe \ufb01 gure of man, or of man in the \ufb01 gure of the animal monster, is stronger, \netc., than natural man. Like a gigantic prosthesis designed to amplify, by \nobjectifying it outside natural man, to amplify the power of the living, the \nliving man that it protects, that it serves, but like a dead machine, or even \na machine of death, a machine which is only the mask of the living, like a \nmachine of death can serve the living. But this state and prosthetic machine, \nlet\u2019s say prosthstatic, this prosthstate must also extend, mime, imitate, even \nreproduce down to the details the living creature that produces it. Which \nmeans that, paradoxically, this political discourse of Hobbes\u2019s is vitalist, or-\nganicist, \ufb01 nalist, and mechanicist. Right down to the detail, the analogistic \ndescription of the Leviathan follows in the body of the state, the Repub-\nlic, the Civitas, the Commonwealth, the whole structure of the human body. \nFor example, the nerves are the penal law, the reward and punishment by \nwhich, says Hobbes, sovereignty, fastening to its service each articulation \nand each member, puts them in motion in order to ful\ufb01 ll their duty. So it is \nwhen talking about penal law that Hobbes, in this physiology of the politi-\ncal, names a sovereignty that is, therefore, the nerve or nervous system of \nthe body politic, which both ensures its articulation and sets it into motion. \nWealth and riches are the state\u2019s strength, the salus populi, or safety, is the \nstate\u2019s business, the counselors are its memory, concord is its health, sedition is \nits illness, and \ufb01 nally, a point to which we shall return often, civil war is its \ndeath. Civil war is the death of the Leviathan, the death of the state, and that \nat bottom is the subject of our seminar: What is a war, today, how can we \n \n53\n \n54\n"

What is the dif-\nference between civil war as \u201cwar of partisans\u201d (a notion of Schmitt\u2019s, who \nsees in Hobbes \u201ctruly a powerful and systematic political thinker\u201d)40 and a \nwar between states? What is the difference between war and terrorism? \nBetween national terrorism and international terrorism? This systematics \nof Hobbes is inconceivable without this prosthstatics (at once zoologistic, \nbiologistic, and  techno- mechanist) of sovereignty, of sovereignty as animal \nmachine, living machine, and death machine. This prosthstatic sovereignty, \nwhich Hobbes recalls in [chapter 9 of] the De Cive, is indivisible41 \u2014 this is \na decisive point that will be very important to us \u2014 presupposes the right of \nman over the beasts. This right of man over the beasts is demonstrated in \nchapter 8 [of the De Cive], \u201cOf the right of Masters over slaves,\u201d just before \nchapter 9, \u201cOf the right of parents over children and on the Patrimonial \nKingdom,\u201d during which sovereignty, domination, or sovereign power is \nsaid to be indivisible (a feature to which we shall return constantly); and \nHobbes demonstrates that this sovereignty, within the family, belongs to \nthe father who is, I quote, \u201ca little king in his house\u201d [\u201cun petit roi dans sa \nmaison\u201d],42 and not to the mother, although by natural generation, in the \nstate of nature, in which, following Hobbes, \u201cit cannot be known who is a \nchild\u2019s father\u201d (an old and tenacious prejudice), it is the mother, the only cer-\ntain generatrix, who controls the child; when one leaves the state of nature \nthrough the civil contract, it is the father who, in a \u201ccivill government,\u201d has \nat his disposal authority and power. And so just before treating \u201cOf the right \nof parents over children and on the Patrimonial Kingdom\u201d (and therefore \nthe absolute right of the father in civil society), at the end of chapter 8, entitled \n\u201cOf the right of Masters over slaves,\u201d Hobbes posits the right of man over \nthe beasts.

The word \u201csubjection,\u201d the gesture of \u201csubduing\u201d is \nat the center of the last paragraph of chapter 8, on the right of the master \nover the slaves, which I\u2019ll read to conclude for today:\nRight over non- rational animals is acquired in the same way as over the \npersons of men, that is, by natural strength and powers. In the natural state, \nbecause of the war of all against all, any one may legitimately subdue or \neven kill Men, whenever that seems to be to his advantage; much more \nwill this be the case against animals. That is, one may at discretion reduce \nto one\u2019s service any animals that can be tamed or made useful, and wage \ncontinual war against the rest as harmful, and hunt them down and kill \nthem. Thus Dominion over animals has its origin in the right of nature not \nin Divine positive right. For if no such right had existed before the publi-\ncation of holy scripture, no one could rightly have slaughtered animals \nfor food except someone to whom the divine will had been revealed in \nthe holy scriptures; and the condition of mankind would surely have been \nvery hard, since the beasts could devour them in all innocence, while they \ncould not devour the beasts. Since therefore it is by natural right that an \nanimal kills a man, it will be by the same right that a man slaughters an \nanimal.43\nConclusion: the beast and [et] the sovereign (couple, coupling, copula), the \nbeast is [est] the sovereign, man is the beast for man, homo homini lupus, Pe-\nter and the wolf, Peter accompanies his grandfather on the wolf hunt, Peter, \nthe grandfather and the wolf, the father is the wolf.\nIn \u201cThe Question of Lay Analysis\u201d (Die Frage der Laienanalyse, 1926), \nFreud pretends to be in dialogue, as you know, with an impartial person, \nand he reminds him that every time a ravenous animal (\u201clike the wolf,\u201d says \nFreud) enters the scene in a story, \u201cwe shall recognize as a disguise of the \nfather.\u201d44 And Freud explains that we cannot account for these fables and \nmyths without returning to infantile sexuality.

The animals are related \nto us, they are even our brothers, says one French translation,46 they are our \nkin, and there are even animal states, but we humans would not be happy \nin them, says Freud in sum. Why? The hypothesis he leaves hanging is \nthat these states are arrested in their history. They have no history and no \nfuture; and the reason for this arrest, this stabilization, this stasis (and in \nthis sense animal states seems more stable and therefore more statelike than \nhuman states), the reason for their relatively  a-historical stasis is a relative \nequilibrium between the environment and their drives. Whereas for man \n(this is the hypothesis that Freud leaves hanging), it is possible that an excess \nor relaunching of libido might have provoked a new rebellion on the part \nof the destructive drive, a new unleashing of the death drive and of cruelty, \nand therefore a relaunching (be it \ufb01 nite or in\ufb01 nite) of history. That is the \nquestion that Freud leaves open for us. (Read Freud, Civilization and Its \nDiscontents, p. 123.)\nWhy do our relatives, the animals, not exhibit any such cultural struggle? \nWe do not know. Very probably some of them \u2014 the bees, the ants, the ter-\nmites \u2014 strove for thousands of years before they arrived at the State institu-\ntions, the distribution of functions and the restrictions on the individual, for \nwhich we admire them to- day. It is a mark of our present condition that we \nknow from our own feelings that we should not think ourselves happy in any \nof these animal States or in any of the roles assigned in them to the individual. \nIn the case of other animal species it may be that a temporary balance has \nbeen reached between the in\ufb02 uences of their environment and the mutually \ncontending instincts within them, and that thus a cessation of development \nhas come about. It may be that in primitive man a fresh access of libido kin-\ndled a renewed burst of activity on the part of the destructive instinct. There \nare a great many questions here to which as yet there is no answer.47\n45. Sigmund Freud, \u201cCivilization and Its Discontents,\u201d in The Standard Edition, 21:\n64\u2013145 (p. 92).\n46.

So that everything comes down to fear: \nI can commit a crime and exert terror by fear, but it is the same fear that \nmakes me obey the law. Fear is \u201csometimes cause of Crime, as when the \ndanger is neither present, nor corporeall\u201d (p. 150). This is an important pre-\ncision: Hobbes privileges \u201cBodily Fear\u201d and the \u201cpresent\u201d of the body, but \nthere is in all fear something that refers, essentially, to non- body and non-\n present, if only the future of a threat: what causes fear is never fully present \nnor fully corporeal, in the sense that the purely corporeal is supposed to be \nsaturated with presence. Fear always exceeds corporeal presence, and this is \nwhy it is also the passion correlative to the law; fear is thus both the origin of \nthe law and of the transgression of the law, the origin of both law and crime. \nAnd if you take fear to the limit of the threat either exerted or felt, i.e. ter-\nror, then you have to conclude that terror is both what motivates respect for \nlaws and the transgression of laws. If you translate \u201claw\u201d by \u201csovereignty\u201d \nand \u201cstate,\u201d you have to conclude that terror is equally opposed to the state \nas a challenge as it is exerted by the state as the essential manifestation of \nits sovereignty. Whence Hobbes\u2019s measured statements\u2014I mean measured \ninto more and less, more or less. There is, at bottom, only fear, fear has no \nopposite, it is coextensive with the whole \ufb01 eld of the passions, and here with \npolitical passion. The political subject is primarily subjected to fear, and it \nis fear that is sometimes the most propitious, sometimes the least propitious, \nbut one cannot not count on it and with it. And fear is primarily fear for \nthe body, for the body proper, for one\u2019s own proper body, i.e. for life. Life \nlives in fear. Life is essentially fearful, fear is the passion of life, etc. \u201cOf all \nPassions, that which enclineth men least to break the Lawes, is Fear.\u201d (Note \nthe strange  logico- grammatical turn of this de\ufb01 nition. Hobbes does not say \nthat fear drives one to obey the laws, more than any other passion; he says \nthat among the passions that incline men to crime, felony, transgression of \nthe law\u2014with the implication that they all do, fear included because he will \nsay at the end of this paragraph that one can commit crime through fear\u2014\namong all the passions that incline humans to crime, felony, transgression \nof the law, fear as passion, as affect, is the one that does so least. And then \nhe will take things the other way around, and examine the other side of the \nsame assertion, from the side not of the transgression but the keeping of \nthe laws; if fear is a passion that is less inclined, less propitious to the infrac-\ntion of the laws, then it is the most propitious, and even the only one that \nis propitious, to their being kept\u2014with the exception, the rare exception \nonly of some \u201cgenerous natures\u201d who can assert the laws without fear, who \ncan preserve the laws or not break them other than by the negative reactiv-\n70 \n71 \n"

And yet in many cases a Crime may be com-\nmitted through Feare\u201d (p. 150).\nWhat is becoming clearer here is that the fear that pushes one to respect \nthe laws and therefore to respect a sovereignty destined, by convention, \nto ensure the protection of the citizens\u2014that this fear is here de\ufb01 ned as a \nhuman thing, as proper to mankind. Hobbes twice speci\ufb01 es this humanity, \nthis properly human quality (\u201cOf all Passions, that which enclineth men \nleast to break the Lawes, is Fear. Nay [. . .] it is the onely thing (when there \nis appearance of pro\ufb01 t, or pleasure by breaking the Lawes,) that makes men \nkeep them\u201d). This humanity, this proper to man here signi\ufb01 es that sover-\neignty, laws, law and therefore the state are nothing natural and are posited \nby contract and convention. They are prostheses. If there is a prosthetic \nstructure to the Leviathan as political animal or monster, this is because \nof its conventional, thetic, contractual structure. The opposition between \nphysis and nomos (nature and law), as opposition between physis and thesis \n(nature and convention, or nature and positing), is here fully and decisively \nfunctional. It follows that law, sovereignty, the institution of the state are \nhistorical and always provisional, let\u2019s say deconstructible, essentially fragile \nor \ufb01 nite or mortal, even if sovereignty is posited as immortal. It is posited as \nimmortal and indivisible precisely because it is mortal and divisible, con-\ntract or convention being destined to ensure for it what it does not have, \nor is not, naturally. So that if sovereignty is, as Hobbes says, the \u201cSoule of \nthe  Common- wealth,\u201d7 this soul is an arti\ufb01 cial, institutional, prosthetic and \nmortal soul: it lasts only as long as law, sovereignty, and the state are able to \nprotect fearful subjects against what is causing them fear. The word protec-\ntion here bears the whole burden of the political, i.e. the insurance contract \nmade between scared or terrorized subjects to delegate to the state or the \nsovereign the charge of protecting them when they cannot protect them-\nselves. They must then obey what protects them. For the fear that pushes \nthem to obey the laws, obedience to the laws, their condition as subject to \nthe law only lasts the time that the sovereign can ensure their protection. \nThis insurance policy [police d\u2019assurance] which basically entrusts to sov-\nereignty the very police [police], the protection of security, comes down to \nmoving from one fear to another. One institutes sovereignty because one is \nfearful (for one\u2019s life, for one\u2019s own body) and therefore because one needs \nto be protected, and then one obeys the law one has instituted through fear \n7.

The Soveraignty is \nthe Soule of the  Common- wealth; which once departed from the Body, the \nmembers doe no more receive their motion from it. The end of Obedience \nis Protection; which, wheresoever a man seeth it, either in his own, or in \nanothers sword, nature applyeth his obedience to it, and his endeavour to \nmaintaine it. And though Soveraignty, in the intention of them that make \nit, be immortall; yet is it in its own nature, not only subject to violent death, \nby forreign war; but also through the ignorance and passions of men, it \nhath in it, from the very institution, many seeds of a naturall mortality, by \nIntestine Discord. (p. 121)\nAs it is for Schmitt, here a good disciple of a Hobbes he often quotes and \nin whom he sees a decisionist theorist of sovereignty, evil is civil war. This \nis what Schmitt says about the great law of protection, which he analyzes \nin utterly historical fashion, i.e. both as historical in the sense of being pro-\nduced by pact, contract, alliance, institution, and as a historical theory, i.e. \n73 \n74 \n"

Protection is \nits essential purpose, the essential function of the state.\nOn the other hand, this protectionist prosthstatic posits the absolute indi-\nvisibility of sovereignty (indivisibility is an analytic part of the concept of \nsovereignty: divisible or sharable sovereignty is not sovereignty).\nThird, \ufb01 nally, the convention, the thesis, the prosthesis, the contract at \nthe origin of sovereignty excludes God just as much\u2014and this will be the \nimportant point for us here\u2014as it excludes the beast.\nIn order to recognize the logic of these three theses, which are, at bot-\ntom, posited on the originary thesis or prosthesis, you can read, among \nother things, chapter 18 of Leviathan, entitled \u201cOf the rights of Soveraignes \nby Institution.\u201d Hobbes begins by positing that a state is \u201cinstituted\u201d (\u201cA \n Common- wealth is said to be Instituted\u201d) when a multitude of men, as it \nwere, become One in their representation, when the One emerges to rep-\nresent the many. To this end, the multitude comes to an agreement and a \nconvention, a Covenant (a word that is also used, as you\u2019ll remember later, \nto translate the Alliance between God and the Jewish people\u2014and \u201ccov-\nenant\u201d is both a noun meaning contract, convention, alliance, commitment, \nand a verb: \u201cto covenant,\u201d meaning to commit oneself, to sign a convention, \nto be party to a contract or an alliance): they \u201cAgree and Covenant,\u201d says \nHobbes: \u201cA  Common- wealth is said to be Instituted, when a Multitude of \nmen do Agree and Covenant, every one with every one, that to whatsoever \nMan, or Assembly of Men, shall be given by the major part, the Right to Pre-\nsent the Person of them all, (that is to say, to be their Representative) [. . .]\u201d \n(p. 121).

Even those who voted against are obliged, they \noblige themselves to be obliged to obey unconditionally. And it is during \nthe exposition of everything that is entailed by this unconditional obedience \nto the convention (I leave you to follow this at the beginning of chapter \n18) that Hobbes encounters and rejects the objection that one can place a \nconvention or a commitment above the one that institutes the state. For ex-\nample, a commitment with respect to God. Some people might claim that \nthey are disobeying the human sovereign because they are obeying God, \nwhose sovereignty trumps that of statesmen.

But things get complicated, in Bodin as well \nas in Hobbes, and we shall have more than one sign of this: in any case \nin Hobbes, as that\u2019s where we are, it gets complicated by the fact that this \nhumanity, this anthropological essence of prosthstatics is produced, from \nthe opening pages of Leviathan, on the divine model. The arti\ufb01 cial man, \nas Hobbes says, the arti\ufb01 cial soul, the \u201cArti\ufb01 cial Animal\u201d that the Levia-\nthan is, imitates the natural art of God: \u201cnature (the Art whereby God hath \nmade and governes the World) is by the Art of man, as in many other things, \nso in this also imitated, that it can make an Arti\ufb01 cial Animal\u201d (p. 9). These \nare the opening words of Leviathan, we already read them, and the conse-\nquences can be seen constantly and everywhere. And this human mimesis \nproduces automats, machines that mimic the natural life created by God. \nThe life of these automats, of these machines, is compared to that of clocks \nand watches. Why could we not say, Hobbes asks immediately afterward, \nthat all the automata (machines or engines that move by virtue of springs \nand wheels, like a watch) have an arti\ufb01 cial life? In this way, a philosophy \nand even a theology of mimesis grounds in the last analysis the most hu-\nmanist and anthropologist discourse of sovereignty. So that, however dif-\n\ufb01 cult it remains, we must ceaselessly understand how the so- called modern \nhumanist or anthropologist insistence on the speci\ufb01 city of the state or of \nso- called modern political sovereignty gets its irreducible originality, i.e. \nits arti\ufb01 cial, conventional, if you will  techno- prosthstatic nature, only by \ngrounding itself in a profound ontotheology, or even in a religion.

I cannot get into this debate here. Balibar thinks that \nthe Greek transliteration on the basis of this edition. The expressions transliterated by \nakran exousian, kurian arch\u2019 and kurion politeuma can be translated, respectively, as \u201csu-\npreme power,\u201d \u201csovereign power,\u201d and \u201csovereign government,\u201d according to Georges \nLeroux. For the Hebrew, Derrida here gives the transliteration tismar shabat; further \non, in the eighth session, he writes Tismar schabet. According to Jean-Jacques Lavoie, \nthe retranscription of these words also involves errors, and the text cited is dif\ufb01 cult \nto read because the last letter is cut off. The Hebrew expression corresponding to the \nGreek text is the following: twmk shbt (pronounced tomek shevet).

God is beyond the sovereign but as the sovereign\u2019s \nsovereign. Which is as much as to say that this theological model of the \nLeviathan, work of human art or arti\ufb01 ce imitating the art of God, this theo-\nlogical model of the political, excludes from the political everything that is \nnot proper to man, God as much as the beast, God like the beast. If God is \nthe model of sovereignty, saying \u201cGod like the beast\u201d puts us again on the \nsame track, snif\ufb01 ng out everything that might attract the one to the other, \nvia this like, the sovereign and the animal, the hypersovereign that God is, \nand the beast. God e(s)t [is / and] with or without \u201cs,\u201d and so with or without \nbeing, the beast. The beast e(s)t God, with or without being (one). The beast \nis God without being (one), a God without being, according to the equivocal \nsyntagma I ventured a very long time ago, I no longer know where.16\nLet\u2019s look \ufb01 rst at the rather awkward exclusion of the convention with \nGod. Hobbes strongly condemns\u2014in a rather symptomatic, scathing tone, \nI think\u2014those who invoke such a convention with God. He does so in \nchapter 18 of the Leviathan. This is the moment when he recalls that some \npeople, in order to disobey their human sovereign, and therefore the con-\nvention that commits them with respect to the sovereign, have claimed to \nrefer to another convention, to a \u201cnew Covenant,\u201d made this time not with \nhumans but with God\u2014the moment when he recalls, basically, that some \npeople posit a law above the laws, a justice above right, and a sovereign \nabove the sovereign; and here Hobbes energetically replies: No; it is just \nas \u201cunjust\u201d to claim that as it is to disobey the sovereign. For there is no \nconvention, no covenant with God. As this is dif\ufb01 cult to say and have ac-\ncepted in this form, Hobbes has to complicate things a little by distinguish-\ning the mediate from the immediate. He basically speci\ufb01 es that there is no \nimmediate convenant with God, but only \u201cby mediation of some body that \nrepresenteth God\u2019s person, which none doth but Gods Lieutenant,\u201d who \nhas sovereignty under God. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cthis pretence of Covenant with \nGod, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own consciences, that is not \nonely an act of an unjust, but also a vile, and unmanly disposition.\u201d17\nThis passage is rich, complex, and abyssal.

If one cannot make a convention \nwith the beast, any more than with God, it is for a reason of language. The \nbeast does not understand our language, and God cannot respond to us, \nthat is, cannot make known to us, and so we could not know in return if our \nconvention is or is not accepted by him. In both cases, there could not be an \nexchange, shared speech, question and response, proposition and response, \nas any contract, convention, or covenant seems to demand. I shall say in \na moment why it is important to me to insist not only on language as ex-\nchange but on this dimension and this moment of response or responsibility. \nBefore I do that, I quote these two paragraphs from chapter 16. The second \nconcerns the exclusion of the covenant with God, but if it is not redundant \nwith respect to the one I have already quoted, this is precisely because of the \nargument he puts forward this time, that of the acceptance of the contract in \na response. Here is the quotation:\nTo make covenant with God, is impossible, but by Mediation of such as \nGod speaketh to [argument of the lieutenant again, then], either by Revela-\ntion supernaturall, or by his Lieutenants that govern under him, and in his \nName: For otherwise we know not whether our Covenants be accepted or \nnot. (p. 77)\nJust before, in the preceding paragraph, Hobbes had posited (and I mean \nposited, for there is something profoundly thetical and dogmatic in this ges-\nture) that a covenant with beasts, brute beasts, is impossible. He used the \nsame terms and the same syntax as for God at the beginning of the follow-\ning paragraph (\u201cTo make covenant with God, is impossible\u201d) and here for \nthe beast: \u201cTo make Covenant with bruit beasts is impossible.\u201d And in the \nargument about language, that beasts do not understand, we \ufb01 nd again \nthe word \u201caccept\u201d: brute beasts could not accept or make known to us, any \nmore than God could, that they accept a convention or enter into that mu-\ntual acceptance that a convention is. Here:\nTo make Covenant with bruit Beasts, is impossible; because not under-\nstanding our speech, they understand not, nor accept of any translation of \nRight; nor can translate any Right to another: and without mutuall accepta-\ntion, there is no Covenant. (Ibid., my emphasis)\nI shall not hasten to say brutally, as I in fact think, that all that is brutally \nfalse, that it is false to say that beasts in general (supposing any such thing \nto exist) or so- called brute beasts (what does \u201cbrute\u201d mean?) do not under-\n89 \n"

Later, \nwe shall read a chapter from De Cive in which, criticizing Aristotle, Hobbes \nsays more about the beasts and the reasons why, in his view, animal societies \ndo not merit the name of \u201ccivil societies.\u201d24 And, above all, and this is more \ninteresting for us at this point, the double exclusion we are talking about, in \nassociating in nonconvention beast and God, but also in nonresponse, gives us \nto think that the sovereign\u2019s sovereign, God himself, like the beast, does not \nrespond, that in any case we cannot be assured of his acceptance, we cannot \ncount on his response. And that is indeed the most profound de\ufb01 nition of \nabsolute sovereignty, of the absolute of sovereignty, of that absoluteness that \nabsolves it, unbinds it from all duty of reciprocity. The sovereign does not \nrespond, he is the one who does not have to, who always has the right not \nto, respond [r\u00e9pondre], in particular not to be responsible for [r\u00e9pondre de] his \nacts. He is above the law [le droit] and has the right [le droit] to suspend the \nlaw, he does not have to respond before a representative chamber or before \njudges, he grants pardon or not after the law has passed. The sovereign has \nthe right not to respond, he has the right to the silence of that dissymmetry. \nHe has the right to a certain irresponsibility. Whence our obscure but I believe \nlucid affect, whence the double sentiment that assails us faced with the abso-\nlute sovereign: like God, the sovereign is above the law and above humanity, \nabove everything, and he looks a bit stupid [b\u00eate], he looks like the beast, and \neven like the death he carries within him, like that death that L\u00e9vinas says is \nnot nothingness, nonbeing, but nonresponse. The sovereign like a God, like a \nbeast, or like death, those are the remains of a \u201clike\u201d that are still on our table. \nIf sovereignty were (but I don\u2019t believe it) proper to man, it would be so much \nlike this expropriating ecstasy of irresponsibility, like this place of nonresponse \nthat is commonly and dogmatically called bestiality, divinity, or death. \nAt this point, and to conclude today by recalling what we have not \nceased to follow, stealthy as wolves, the trace of the wolf that we shall be \nseeing again in January when we read La Fontaine\u2019s The Wolf and the Lamb \nafter September 11, I shall be content to reconnoiter very rapidly a sort of \nstrange genealogy of the wolf (lukos), a genelycological \ufb01 liation, a strange \ngenelycology, the path of a track that, from one cave to another, leads to \nthe alliance (from north, south, east or west) between all these claimants to \nsovereignty who thus assemble and so resemble each other: the wolf, man, \nGod.

Who or which [qui ou quel] (qualis) can also mean \nwho or what [qui ou quoi].\nJust as Montaigne\u2019s sentence was inscribed in a  marriage- contract scene, \nhere we must not neglect the fact that this sentence from Plautus is placed \nin the mouth of a merchant (mercator) and that we are dealing with a capi-\ntalistic market scene, a scene of lending or credit [de cr\u00e9ance ou de cr\u00e9dit]. \nThe merchant does not want to give credit, entrust or lend money to, some-\none he does not know, and who could, then, behave like a wolf.

And is not the substitution of wolf for man, the substi-\ntution, for man, of the wolfman for man, the substitution of what for who?\nGo \ufb01 gure [Allez savoir].

Neglect \u2014 is that not \nalways a way of not reading or not electing [\u00e9lire] or gathering (legere), the \n\u201cnot\u201d (ne, nec, neg) carrying the whole burden of the question on negation, \ndenegation, repression, suppression, forgetting, amnesia, etc., in a context \nof legere, reading, putting together or gathering? Rousseau stops stealing, \nas he approaches the age of sixteen, in order to devote himself to reading \nand what he calls his \u201clove of imaginary objects.\u201d And this love of reading \n(legere), the love of the book, paradoxically, this love of imaginary objects, \nfar from turning him toward culture and cultivated society, makes him sav-\nage, mute, silent, asocial; \u201csavage\u201d is his word: \u201cmy humor became taciturn, \nsavage; my head was beginning to spoil, and I lived like a real werewolf.\u201d\n1.

Or not suppress them? Or not repress them? Or not neglect them? \nAnd if to forget, suppress, repress, neglect, with or without negation, dis-\navowal or denial, is in a certain way to chase (away), is chasing to expel, \nexclude, \ufb02 ee, neglect, or else, on the contrary, to follow, pursue, persecute, \ntrack down, run after?\nSo we still need to know how to deal with the wolf. And to know what \nkind of chase we\u2019re dealing with, in what we have called our genealogy of \nthe wolf, our book of wolves, our genelycology. A genelycology that must \ninscribe in its tree, its genealogical tree, what is called the lycanthrope, the \nwolf- man, man made wolf or wolf made man.\nWhen one associates the wolf with the tree, there immediately arises the \ndream of Freud\u2019s Wolf Man,3 the Wolf Mann who recounts how he saw, in \na dream, sitting in a tree, a big walnut tree, six or seven white wolves who, \nlet\u2019s not forget, also resembled other animals, foxes, he said \u2014 and there are \nfoxes waiting for us today \u2014 or sheepdogs, because they had big tails like \n(like, always the analogy!) foxes, and ears pricked like (like!) dogs. So there is \na whole menagerie, a whole zoological crowd that does more than swarm, \nthat is meaningfully organized in the Wolf Man\u2019s dream. Other animals \nwill come up in the analysis, for example, the wasp and the butter\ufb02 y. And \nthe Wolf Man immediately admits his fear of being devoured by the wolf: \nit is this terror, this terrorism of wolves, that wakes him up by making him \ncry out. He refers himself, to account for his associations, to a book, pre-\ncisely, a book that Freud does not neglect in his interpretation, namely the \nillustration of a fable or a narrative, \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood.\u201d To explain \nthe \ufb01 gure of six or seven wolves, Freud has him be more speci\ufb01 c with refer-\n2.

All the ancestors of the Wolf Man are, then, present in the \ngenealogical tree, in the feminine and in the masculine, in the positions of \nbeast and sovereign, beast and master, the more so in that in the interval we \nencounter a  master- wolf, Wolf being the name of the child\u2019s Latin master \nat school. We shall also be coming back to this question of the schoolmaster \ntoday. But I leave you to reread the Wolf Man, which I abandon here, for in \nthis genelycological tree, in this library of wolves, what we shall in the end \nbe interested in today is not so much the \u201cWolf Man\u201d as the wolf- man, the \nlycanthrope, the  becoming- man of the wolf and the  becoming- wolf of the \nman. For example, the werewolf.\nIt is this metaphor or rather this analogical metamorphosis, this fan-\ntastical production, that is important to us in the political entrance we are \nseeking, in the political access or approach to what can play the role of a \nmediating schema between the beast and the sovereign. In the political \nor zooanthropological \ufb01 eld. The zooanthropological, rather than the bio-\npolitical, is our problematic horizon.\nThe [feminine] beast and the [masculine] sovereign. La . . . le.\nIn previous sessions, we paid some attention to a double oscillation. A \ndouble vacillation too seemed to give its rhythm to something like the pen-\ndulum of this title, of the simple statement or rather the oral saying of this \ntext. In French, in the French tongue, and I insist on the tongue and the \ngenders it imposes on us. La b\u00eate et le souverain. La . . . le. And as for orality, \nbetween mouth and maw, we have already seen its double carry [port\u00e9e], the \ndouble tongue, the carry of the tongue that speaks, carry as the carry of the \nvoice that vociferates (to voci- ferate is to carry the voice) and the other carry, \nthe other devouring one, the voracious carry of the maw and the teeth that \nlacerate and cut to pieces. Vociferation and devourment, we were saying, \nbut let us not hasten to attribute speech to the mouth of man supposed to \nspeak and voracity or even the vociferation of the cry to the animal\u2019s maw. \nIt is precisely this simple and dogmatic opposition, the abuses of this over-\nsimpli\ufb01 cation that we have in our sights here.\nWe had, then, started to give some weight to an oscillation, a vacillation \ncome in a not quite fortuitous way to affect the pendulum of the title thus \n100 \n"

This \noscillating or vacillating rhythm is imprinted on each of its words, the ar-\nticles (la, le), the nouns or substantives (b\u00eate, souverain), the verb, the copula \nor the conjunction (et, e[s]t). And as I have just noted, the suspension of this \npendulum is double.\nOn the one hand, \ufb01 rst oscillation, the sexual difference marked at least \nby French grammar (la . . . le), which seemed by chance (as we illustrated \nwith more than one fact and more than one text) to con\ufb01 rm that the beast \nwas often the living thing to be subjected, dominated, domesticated, mas-\ntered, like, by a not insigni\ufb01 cant analogy, the woman, the slave, or the child. \nRemember the Hobbes texts we read on this subject, on the subject of the \nright over beasts, in the De Cive. And the sexual difference that seemed \nalso to con\ufb01 rm (as we illustrated with more than one fact and more than \none text) that the sovereign appeared most often in the masculine \ufb01 gure of \nthe king, the master, the chief, the paterfamilias, or the husband \u2014 of the \nipseity of the ipse, concerning which a few years ago, reading Benveniste, \nwe had emphasized that, in its very etymology,4 it implies the exercise of \npower by someone it suf\ufb01 ces to designate as himself, ipse. The sovereign, \nin the broadest sense of the term, is he who has the right and the strength \nto be and be recognized as himself, the same, properly the same as himself. \nBenveniste, to whom I refer you, goes on to wonder about the \ufb01 liation of \npoti, Sanskrit patyate, Latin potior (to have power over something, to have at \none\u2019s disposal, to possess, potsedere): \u201cThe notion of \u2018power\u2019 [. . .] is then con-\nstituted and it receives its verbal form from the predicative expression pote \nest contracted into potest which engenders the conjugation possum, potest, \u2018I \nam capable, I can.\u2019 \u201d5 Now, and I insist on this point, for we will not cease to \nmeasure its consequences, Benveniste had inscribed the value of ipseity, the \nipse, the \u201coneself,\u201d the \u201chim(one)self\u201d in the same \ufb01 liation, as though power \nwere \ufb01 rst of all recognized in the one who could be designated or who \ncould be the \ufb01 rst to designate himself as the same, a himself, a oneself. We \ncommented a few years back on these lines of Benveniste, who is surprised \nthat a word meaning \u201cmaster\u201d (as he had shown a page earlier: potis, in San-\nskrit patih (master and husband), in Greek posis (husband), in composition \ndespote\u00afs) should become so enfeebled (Benveniste\u2019s word and evaluation, but \nI do not believe one can speak here of enfeeblement, of loss of power \u2014 to \nthe contrary) as to signify \u201chimself.\u201d On the other hand, Benveniste un-\n4. \u00c9mile Benveniste, article \u201cHospitalit\u00e9,\u201d in Le vocabulaire des institutions europ\u00e9-\nennes, 2 vols.
