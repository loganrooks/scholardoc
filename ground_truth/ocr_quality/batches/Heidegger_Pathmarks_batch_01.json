The \neditor has also indicated a number of places where the text of the Gesamt\u00ad\nausgabe edition differs from that of the first, 1967 edition of Wegmarken.

Where such standards \nhave become available in one's philosophizing, a type of critical review ori\u00ad\nented to fixed standards is not only justifiable but may also even be urgently \nneeded, and all the more so when the work under discussion is experienced \nas unsettling, provocative, and challenging. But this kind of critical review \nhas been ruled out at present insofar as Jaspers's investigation will not be \njudged with the help of such ideas as \"the absolute validity of truth,\" \"rela\u00ad\ntivism,\" and \"skepticism.\" This type of assessment will be avoided precisely \nbecause the following comments endeavor to sharpen our consciences re\u00ad\ngarding the need to inquire into the genuine sense of the \"history of ideas,\" \nand return radically to the original genetic motivations in this history that \nled to the establishment of such epistemological ideals in philosophy.

In this regard, the meaning of the term \"theory\" is \nitself geared precisely to its origin (cf. Plato, Aristotle). The \"idea\" that \nwe have of the meaning and scope of this task is such that it can scarcely \nbe overestimated. To the contrary, we will come to see what is concretely \n\"necessary\" in philosophy precisely by restricting rmrselves to this task and \nconsciously abandoning aspirations to \"creative\" philosophizing that are in \nfact traditional, even if somewhat historically open-ended. \nIf this critical review emphatically rules out any intention of assess\u00ad\ning Jaspers's work with fixed, highly refined points of reference that have \ndemonstrably not, however, been appmpriated in any radical sense, it is like\u00ad\nwise very suspicious of all indulgent \"philosophies of life\" that make claims \nto free thinking and an apparent primordiality. \"Philosophy of life\" will \nbe called into question by analyzing it to show that the basic philosophical \n3 \n"

A definite orientation is also to be found in the \nbasic approach that will be adopted and enacted in this review. The es\u00ad\nsential characteristic of this approach is expressed precisely in the \"how\" \nof our persisting in it. And this \"how\" of our critical attitude always re\u00ad\nmains subject to a type of appropriation that must constantly renew itself \nin the form of a destruction. Our critical review is phenomenological in \nthe genuine sense, but it is not \"without presuppositions\" in the bad sense. \nHere one turns what is immediately \"on hand\" in one's objective historical, \nintellectual situation into the in-itself of the \"things themselves.\" One fails \nto see what is characteristic of all intuition, namely, that it is enacted in \nthe context of a definite orientation and an anticipatory preconception of \nthe respective region of experience. Thus, when one shuns constructivistic \npoints of view that are foreign to the subject matter, and is concerned with \nimmediacy only in this respect, one's intuition can all too easily fall prey to \na cenain blindness regarding the fact that its own motivational basis is itself \nin the end not primordial. The meaning of primordiality does not lie in the \nidea of something outside of history or beyond it; rather, it shows itself in \nthe fact that thinking without presuppositions can itself be achieved only in \na self-critique that is historically oriented in a factical manner. An incessant \nenactment of our concern for achieving primordiality is what constitutes \nprimordiality. (The term \"historical\"z is used here in a sense that will be\u00ad\ncome somewhat more explicit in the course of the following reflections.) \nThinking without presuppositions is here intended to be taken in a philo\u00ad\nsophical sense and not in a specifically scientific sense. The path that leads \nto the \"things themselves\" treated in philosophy is a long one. Thus the \nexcessive liberties taken recently by many phenomenologists in their use of \nessential intuition appear in a very dubious light, and are hardly in line with \nthe \"openness\" and \"devotion\" to the things themselves preached by these \nphenomenologists. It might just be the case that even the directions of in\u00ad\nquiry in which we could find access to the things themselves of philosophy \nlie covered over for us, and that what is thus necessary is a radical kind of \ndeconstruction and reconstruction, i.e., a genuine confrontation with the \nhistory that we ourselves \"are.\" And this confrontation would be something \nthat is enacted within the very meaning of philosophizing.

To begin with, we need to \nsee but one thing: namely, a preconception about psychical lifo, which is expressed \nin a particular manner, is already given and at v:ork in Jaspers's initial approach \nto the problem of psychical lifo. \nPsychology of worldviews is not supposed to work out a doctrine of life \nand impose it on others; rather, its goal is \"to give clarifications and possibil\u00ad\nities that can serve as means to self-reflection.\" This work of clarification \nmeans clarification of \"life,\" and here \"life\" is seen in some manner. In \nJaspers's initial approach to this clarification, in the techniques he uses for \nit, and in the nature and scope of his goals here, life itself is forced to appear \nunder a certain asped for those who are appropriating such clarifications. If \npossibilities are disclosed, they are possibilities under a certain articulated \naspect of our life and psychical existence, and .for the sake of it. A notion of \nthe essential meaning of the \"how\" of life itself is expressed in this aspect. \nHowever much Jaspers made the attempt to undertake everything in the \nnon prejudicial attitude of mere observation, it is nonetheless the case that, \nwhen we go to understand what he has presented in his observations and \nuse it in our own self-reflection, we are required to adopt, and acquiesce \nin, certain basic approaches to the way in which life and the self are to \nbe intended. If genuine psychology is supposed to allow us to see \"what \nthe human being is\" (5), then the initial manner in which it actually poses \nthe problem must from the stan harbor within it certain preconceptions \nabout the sense of being that belongs to this whole of our psychical, mental \nDasein, and then again preconceptions about the possible \"how\" in accor\u00ad\ndance with which this life, having now been clarified, is supposed to be \nlived, i.e., preconceptions about the basic sense of that in which such things \nas \"possibilities\" can in any sense be brought to light. \nHowever, in seeing these particular preconceptions that accompany \nJaspers's investigations, we should not be tempted to undertake a philo\u00ad\nsophically feeble and sterile type of sham critique in which we would now \nreproach Jaspers for having contradirted his own intentions, maintaining on \nthe basis of this charge that his intentions could never be realized in the \nconcrete, and arguing that his whole project is thus \"refuted in principle\" \nand \"dealt with.\" This type of criticism always claims a formal type of su\u00ad\nperiority in argumentation, but it thereby fails to take up the productive \npossibility of returning in a positive fashion to the thoughts in question and \nunderstanding them in a deeper sense.

This is \nthe case not only because it should be possible for the underlying tendency \nof these problems to be realized in a more consistent and genuine manner, \nbut also and primarily because the object that has been apprehended in \nthese preconceptions is in fact what it is only by virtue of a primordially \nimmanent \"method.\" This method is part of the object's very makeup, and \nis not something merely foisted on the object from the outside. If one is \nnot aware of this problem of explication in a \"rigorous\" enough manner, \none can, to be sure, nonetheless still wind up actually intending the object \nin some manner, but a kind of surrogate will, without further explanation, \nhave been inserted into one's intuition and concepts. This surrogate will \nthen henceforth constantly make demands on us to treat it from different \nsides in order to master it in knowledge (we are motivated to do this on \nthe basis of real acts of intending the object, but these intentions do not \nget involved with the object and grasp it).

Having such a formally indicated \nmeaning, this concept is intended to point to the phenomenon of the \"I \nam,\" i.e., to the sense of being in this \"I am\" that forms the starting point \nof an approach to a context of fundamental phenomena and the problems \ninvolved there. In formal indication (which should be seen to make up the \nfundamental methodological sense of all philosophical concepts and their \nrelationships, though this will not be explained in more detail here), any \nuncritical lapse into a particular interpretation of existence - for example, \nKierkegaard's or Nietzsche's - ought to be avoided from the start, so that we \ncan free up the possibility of pursuing a genuine sense of the phenomenon \nof existence and explicate what comes to the fore in this pursuit.

It is this interplay of motives that has led to the predominance \nof the current interest in the reality of mental life and to the interpreta\u00ad\ntion of life primarily from the point of view of the human sciences, even \nthough biological concepts of life have not been completely eradicated here. \nThe characteristic feature of this intellectual situation is perhaps precisely a \nmuddled interplay of biological, psychological, social-scientific, aesthetic\u00ad\nethical, and religious concepts of life. It is in this muddled fashion that prob\u00ad\nlems in contemporary philosophy are predominantly centered on \"life\" as \nthe \"primordial phenomenon\" in one of two ways. Either life is approached \nas the fundamental reality, and all phenomena are seen to lead back to it, so \nthat everything and anything is understood as an objectification and mani\u00ad\nfestation \"of life.\" Or else life is seen as the formation of culture, and this \nformation is thought to be carried out with reference to normative prin\u00ad\nciples and values. The meaning of this watchword \"life\" should be allowed \nto remain ambiguous, so that it is able to indicate for us all the different phe\u00ad\nnomena that are intended in it. Here we need to single out two directions \nin the sense of this term that have led the way in shaping its meaning, and in \nwhich we find expressed a tendency toward the phenomenon of existence. \n(I) Life is understood as objectifying in the widest sense, as an act of \ncreative formation and achievement, as an act of going out of itself, and \nthus-though this is not clearly spelled out-as something like our \"being \nthere\" [\"Da sein\"] in this life and as this life. \n(z) Life is understood as experiencing, as having an experience, un\u00ad\nderstanding, appropriating, and thus -though again the connection is left \nunexplained-as something like our \"being there\" in such experiencing.) \nThe progress that Jaspers's work makes lies in the fact that his classifi\u00ad\ncation of the phenomena, which have not previously been made available \nin this manner, has called our attention to the problem of existence in a \nmuch more concentrated fashion, and has in connection with this moved \nthe problems of psychology into more fundamental domains. Its philo\u00ad\nsophical shoncoming with respect to the need for actually getting down \nto work and delving into the problems it broaches is clearly visible in the \nfact that Jaspers persists in a certain untested opinion. He thinks that the \npreconception about \"the whole\" that was highlighted above can help him \nget a handle on the phenomenon of existence, and that he can understand \nthis phenomenon precisely by means of those concepts already available to \nhim in his intellectual milieu. \nKeeping in mind the positive tendency of] aspers's work that is directed \ntoward the phenomenon of existence, we now need to discuss the above\u00ad\nmentioned preconception of this work with regard to the methodological \nI J \n"

If \nsuch an adjudication of this preconception is to be what we intend it to be, \nthen it can only mean that we must carry out a type of examination that is de\u00ad\nmanded by the very sense of this preconception. And our examination must \naccordingly focus on the question of whether the motivation that leads to \nthe formation of the full sense of this preconception actually enjoys the level \nof primordiality that is claimed for it. The full sense of any phenomenon \nincludes the following intentional characteristics: the intentional relation, \nthe intentional content, and the intentional enactment (here \"intentional\" \nmust be understood in a completely formal sense, so as to avoid any spe\u00ad\ncial emphasis on a theoreticm sense of the intentional relation, and it is this \nspecific meaning of \"intentional\" that is so easily suggested when one un\u00ad\nderstands intentionality as \"thinking a bout\" [\"Meinen von j or, correlatively, \nas \"being-thought\"). Our treatment of these intentional characteristics that \nmake up the sense of any phenomenon should not consist of arranging them \nas an aggregate or succession of moments that have been tallied up. Rather, \ntheir sense derives from a structural context of relationships that varies in \neach case according to the levels and directions of experience involved. This \ncontext of relationships and the shifts of emphasis that occur here should \nnot be understood as a \"result\" or as a momentary \"addendum,\" but as the \nauthentic factor that comes to light in the phenomenological articulation \nof the above-mentioned intentional characteristics. In tum, this authentic \nfactor is itself to be understood precisely as a kind of prestruction in one's \nown existence. Such prestruction is in each case enacted and actualized \nin the current facticity of one's life in the form of a self-appropriation.

And this question cannot \nbe answered in a formally deductive manner, but rather only by starting \nfrom particular contexts of phenomena and allowing ourselves to be guided \nby them. It could be that, in accord with its sense, observation always has a \ntheorizing character, but this does not necessarily entail that the sense of be\u00ad\ning belonging to what is observed must as such become accessible primarily \nwithin observation. And it is this simple point that we have been stressing \nin our examination of Jaspers's preconception. The relational sense of the \ninitial giving of the object is not also the relational sense of the explication \nthat has come across this pregiven object. Accordingly, the mere obser\u00ad\nvation that has been used throughout Jaspers's work, and that extends all \nthe way to the preconception in which the actual object of investigation is \ngiven, has in no way been justified by Jaspers as the appropriate method \nof explication. The basic experience in which the actual object is initially \ngiven needs to be examined regarding its full sense, and it must prescribe \nfor us the genuine structure of explication. \"Observation\" in Jaspers's sense \nmight be a fitting approach, but it also might not be. An answer to this \nquestion will be obtained in the following discussion, but for the rime being \nit will take the form of making visible the problems involved here. To this \nend, that which Jaspers has taken up in the preconception of his work must \nbe discussed in more concrete terms. \nThe whole of life, i.e., life itself, is something about which we can say \nnothing directly (z88). But it must indeed be intended by us somehow, \nsince our consciousness of our existence arises precisely from the fact that \nwe look to the whole of life. \\Vhen human beings \"see [their finite situa\u00ad\ntions) within the whole,\" when they \"want to attain certainty about the \ntotality of things,\" they have the experience that the objective world and \ntheir subjective action are split apart in the form of an antinomy. \"Insofar as \nthe driving forces in worldviews move human beings,\" and insofar as human \nbeings are somehow \"concerned about something essential,\" \"they always \nfind themselves on the way to the infinite or the whole.\" It is \"in view of \nthe infinite\" that human beings find themselves in antinomies.

What is it that we strive after in \nthese \"observations\" that are supposed to provide us with the fundamental \npresuppositions, and how do we strive after it? \nIt is possible thatJaspers wants these observations to be understood in \na very formal sense.

If the meaning of objectivity in philosophical \nknowledge has not been clarified beforehand, we can decide nothing about \nthe role of this distinction in philosophy. \nConcerning Kierkegaard, we should point out that such a heightened \nconsciousness of methodological rigor as his has rarely been achieved in \nphilosophy or theology (the question of where he achieved this rigor is not \nimportant here). One loses sight of nothing less than the most important \naspect of Kierkegaard's thought when one overlooks this consciousness of \nmethod, or when one's treatment of it takes it to be of secondary importance. \nJaspers falls under the spell of a deception when he thinks that it is \nprecisely in mere observation that he would achieve the highest degree of \nnoninterference in the personal decisions of his readers, and would thus \nfree these individuals for their own self-reflection. On the contrary, by \npresenting his investigations as mere observations he indeed appears to \navoid imposing on his readers particular worldviews, i.e., the ones that he \nhas described, but he pushes his readers into believing that his unexamined \npreconception (life as a whole) and the essential kinds of articulation corre\u00ad\nsponding to it are something obvious and noncommittal, whereas it is rather \nprecisely in the meaning of these concepts and the \"how\" of interpreting \nthat everything is really decided. Mere observation does not give us what \nit wants to, namely, the possibility of radical reexamination, decision, and, \nwhat is synonymous with these, an intense consciousness of the method\u00ad\nological necessity of questioning.

Moreover, it can be genuinely \nawoken only if the Other is in a certain way relentlessly compelled to en\u00ad\ngage in reflection, and thereby sees that one's appropriation of the objects \ntreated in philosophy is inseparably bound up with a certain rigor in the \nenactment of method. All sciences fall short of this kind of rigor, since in \nthe sciences it is only the demand for objectivity that is important, whereas \nin philosophy what belongs together with the matters treated is the philos\u00ad\nophizing individual and (his) notorious poverty. One can call something to \nthe attention of others, and compel them to engage in reflection, only by \ntraveling a stretch of the way oneself. \nJaspers might be able to justify his having allowed the problem of method \nto recede into the background by pointing out that he did not endeavor to \n"

This is not to say that Christian theology is the only theology. \nThe most central question is whether, indeed, theology in general is a \nscience. This question is deferred here, not because we wish to evade the \nproblem, but only because that question cannot be asked meaningfully until \nthe idea of theology has been clarified to a cenain extent. \nBefore ruming to the discussion proper, we wish to submit the following \nconsiderations. In accordance with our thesis, we are considering a positive \nscience, and evidently one of a particular kind. Therefore a few remarks \nare in order about what constirutes the positive character of a science as \nsuch. \nProper to the positive character of a science is: first, that a being that in \nsome way is already disclosed is to a cenain extent come upon as a possi\u00ad\nble theme of theoretical objectification and inquiry; second, that this given \npositum is come upon in a definite prescientific manner of approaching and \nproceeding with that being. In this manner of procedure, the specific con\u00ad\ntent of this region and the mode of being of the particular entity show \nthemselves. That is, this disclosure is prior to any theoretical apprehend\u00ad\ning, although it is perhaps implicit and not thematically known. Third, it is \nproper to the positive character of a science that this prescientific comport\u00ad\nment toward whatever is given (nature, history, economy, space, nwnber) \nis also already illwninated and guided by an understanding of being - even \nif it be nonconceptual. The positive character can vary according to the \nsubstantive content of the entity, its mode of being, the manner in which \nit is prescientifically disclosed, and the manner in which this disclosedness \nbelongs to it. \nThe question thus arises: Of what sort is the positive character of the\u00ad\nology? Evidently this question must be answered before we can be in a \nposition to determine its relation to philosophy. But setting down the pos\u00ad\nitive character of theology will not yet sufficiently clarify its status as a \nscience. We have not yet arrived at the full concept of theology as a sci\u00ad\nence, but only at what is proper to it as a positive science. If thematizing \nis supposed to adjust the direction of inquiry, the manner of investigation, \nand the concepruality to the particular positum in each case, it is more to \nthe point here to identify the specific scientific character belonging to the \nspecific positive character of theology. Therefore, only by identifying the \npositive and the scientific character of theology do we approach this disci\u00ad\npline as a positive science and acquire the basis for characterizing its possible \nrelationship to philosophy. \n"

For the \"Christian\" \nfaith, that being which is primarily revealed to faith, and only to it, and \nwhich, as revelation, first gives rise to faith, is Christ, the crucified God. \nThe relationship of faith to the cross, determined in this way by Christ, \nis a Christian one. The crucifixion, however, and all that belongs to it is \na historical event, and indeed this event gives testimony to itself as such \nin its specifically historical character only for faith in the scriptures. One \n\"knows\" about this fact only in believing. \nThat which is thus revealed in faith is, in accordance with its specific \n\"sacrificial\" character, impaned specifically to individual human beings fac\u00ad\ntically existing historically (whether contemporaneous or not), or to the \ncommunity of these individuals existing as a community. The imparting \nof this revelation is not a conveyance of information about present, past, \nor imminent happenings; rather, this imparting lets one \"pan-take\" of the \nevent that is revelation ( = what is revealed therein) itself. But the pan\u00ad\ntaking of faith, which is realized only in existing, is given as such always only \nthrough faith. Furthermore, this \"pan-taking\" and \"having pan in\" the \nevent of the crucifixion places one's entire existence [Dasein] - as a Chris\u00ad\ntian existence, i.e., one bound to the cross - before God. And thereby the \nexistence struck by this revelation is revealed to itself in its forgetfulness of \nGod. Thus - and again I speak only of an ideal construction of the idea -\nbeing placed before God means that existence is reoriented in and through \nthe mercy of God grasped in faith. Thus faith understands itself only in \nbelieving. In any case, the believer does not come to know anything about \nhis specific existence, for instance, by way of a theoretical confirmation of \nhis inner experiences. Rather, he can only \"believe\" this possibility of exis\u00ad\ntence as one which the Dasein concerned does not independently master, \nin which it becomes a slave, is brought before C'..od, and is thus born again. \nAccordingly, the proper existentiell meaning of faith is: faith = rebirth. And \nrebirth does not mean a momentary outfitting with some quality or other, \nbut a way in which a factical, believing Dasein historically exists in that his\u00ad\ntory which begins with the occurrence of revelation; in that history which, \nin accord with the very meaning of the revelation, has a definite uttermost \nend. The occurrence of revelation, which is passed down to faith and which \naccordingly occurs in faithfulness itself, discloses itself only to faith. \nLuther said, \"Faith is permitting ourselves to be seized by the things \nwe do not see\" (Werke [Erlangen Ausgabe], vol. 46, p. 287). Yet faith is \nnot something that merely reveals that the occurring of salvation is some\u00ad\nthing happening; it is not some more or less modified type of knowing. \n44 \n"

Faith is the belin!illg\u00ad\nUIIderstanding mode of existing i11 the history revealed, i.e., ocC'lmng, with the \nCnuified. \nThe totality of this being that is disclosed by faith - in such a way, in\u00ad\ndeed, that faith itself belongs to the context of its disclosure - constitutes \nthe character of the positum that theology finds before it. Presuposing that \ntheology is enjoined on faith, out of faith, and for faith, and presupposing that \nscience is a freely performed, conceptual disclosure and objectification, the\u00ad\nology is constituted in thematizing faith and that which is disclosed through \nfaith, that which is \"revealed.\" It is worthy of note that faith is not just the \nmanner in which the positum objectified by theology is already disclosed \nand presented; faith itself is a theme for theology. And not only that. Inso\u00ad\nfar as theology is enjoined upon faith, it can find sufficient motivation for \nitself only in faith. If faith would totally oppose a conceptual interpreta\u00ad\ntion, then theology would be a thoroughly inappropriate means of grasping \nits object, faith. It would lack something so essential that without this it \ncould never become a science in the first place. The necessity of theol\u00ad\nogy, therefore, can never be deduced from a purely rationally constructed \nsystem of sciences. Furthermore, faith not only motivates the interven\u00ad\ntion of an interpretive science of Christianness; at the same time, faith, as \nrebirth, is that history to whose occurrence theology itself, for its part, is \nsupposed to contribute. Theology has a meaning and a legitimacy only if \nit functions as an ingredient of faith, of this particular kind of historical \noccurrence. \nBy attempting to elucidate this connection [between theology and faith], \nwe are likewise showing how, through the specific positive character of \ntheology, i.e., through the Christian occurrence disclosed in faith as faith, \nthe scientific character of the science of faith is prefigured. \nb) THE SCIENTIFIC CHARACTER OF THEOLOGY \nTheology is the science of faith. \nThis says several things: \n( 1) Theology is the science of that which is disclosed in faith, of that \nwhich is believed. That which is believed in this case is not some coherent \norder of propositions about facts or occurrences which we simply agree to -\nwhich, although theoretically not self-evident, can be appropriated because \nwe agree to them. \n45 \n"
