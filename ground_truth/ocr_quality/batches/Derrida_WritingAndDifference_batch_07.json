It is thus not enough to speak of writing in\norder to be faithful to Freud, for it is then that we may betray him more\nthan ever.\nThis is what the last chapter of the Traumdeutung explains. An entirely\nand conventionally topographical metaphor of the psychical apparatus\nis to be completed by invoking the existence of force and of two kinds\nof processes of excitation or modes of its discharge: \u201cSo let us try to\ncorrect some conceptions [intuitive illustrations: Anschauungen] which\nmight be misleading so long as we looked upon the two systems in the\nmost literal and crudest sense as two localities in the mental\napparatus\u2014conceptions which left their traces in the expressions \u2018to\nrepress\u2019 and \u2018to force a way through.\u2019 Thus, we may speak of an\nunconscious thought seeking to convey itself into the preconscious so\nas to be able then to force its way through into consciousness. What we\nhave in mind here is not the forming of a second thought situated in a\nnew place, like a transcription (Umschrift) which continues to exist\nalongside the original; and the notion of forcing a way through into\nconsciousness must be kept carefully free from any idea of a change of\nlocality\u201d (V, 610).13\nLet us interrupt our quotation for a moment. The conscious text is\nthus not a transcription, because there is no text present elsewhere as an\nunconscious one to be transposed or transported. For the value of\npresence can also dangerously a\ufb00ect the concept of the unconscious.\nThere is then no unconscious truth to be rediscovered by virtue of\nhaving been written elsewhere. There is no text written and present\nelsewhere which would then be subjected, without being changed in\nthe process, to an operation and a temporalization (the latter belonging\nto consciousness if we follow Freud literally) which would be external\nto it, \ufb02oating on its surface. There is no present text in general, and\nthere is not even a past present text, a text which is past as having been\npresent. The text is not conceivable in an originary or modi\ufb01ed form of\npresence. The unconscious text is already a weave of pure traces, di\ufb00er-\nences in which meaning and force are united\u2014a text nowhere present,\nfreud and the scene of writing 265\n"

Erases it while producing it: the\nmedium of the dialogue and misunderstanding between the Husserlian\nand Heideggerian concepts of Being-in- the-world.)\nConcerning this nontranscriptive writing, Freud adds a fundamental\nspeci\ufb01cation. This speci\ufb01cation will reveal: (1) the danger involved in\nimmobilizing or freezing energy within a naive metaphorics of place;\n(2) the necessity not of abandoning but of rethinking the space or\ntopology of this writing; (3) that Freud, who still insists on representing\nthe psychical apparatus in an arti\ufb01cial model, has not yet discovered a\nmechanical model adequate to the graphematic conceptual scheme he\nis already using to describe the psychical text.\nAgain, we may speak of a preconscious thought being repressed or\ndriven out and then taken over by the unconscious. These images,\nderived from a set of ideas (Vorstellungskreis) relating to a struggle for a\npiece of ground, may tempt us to suppose that it is literally true that a\nmental grouping (Anordnung) in one locality has been brought to an\nend and replaced by a fresh one in another locality. Let us replace\nthese metaphors by something that seems to correspond better to the\nreal state of affairs, and let us say that some particular mental group-\ning has had a cathexis of energy (Energiebesetzung) attached to it or\nwithdrawn from it, so that the structure in question has come under\nthe sway of a particular agency or been withdrawn from it. What we are\ndoing here is once again to replace a topographical way of represent-\ning things by a dynamic one. What we regard as mobile (das Bewegli-\nche) is not the psychical structure itself but its innervation [V, 610\u2013611].\nLet us once more interrupt our quotation. The metaphor of translation\nas the transcription of an original text would separate force and ex-\ntension, maintaining the simple exteriority of the translated and the\ntranslating. This very exteriority, the static and topological bias of the\nmetaphor, would assure the transparency of a neutral translation, of a\nfreud and the scene of writing 267\n"

Freud emphasizes this: psychic\nwriting does not lend itself to translation because it is a single energetic\nsystem (however di\ufb00erentiated it may be), and because it covers the\nentirety of the psychical apparatus. Despite the di\ufb00erence of agencies,\npsychical writing in general is not a displacement of meanings within\nthe limpidity of an immobile, pregiven space and the blank neutrality\nof discourse. A discourse which might be coded without ceasing to be\ndiaphanous. Here energy cannot be reduced; it does not limit meaning,\nbut rather produces it. The distinction between force and meaning is\nderivative in relation to an archi-trace; it belongs to the metaphysics of\nconsciousness and of presence, or rather of presence in the word, in the\nhallucination of a language determined on the basis of the word or of\nverbal representation. The metaphysics of preconsciousness, Freud\nmight say, since the preconscious is the place he assigns to the verbal.\nWithout that, would Freud have taught us anything new?\nForce produces meaning (and space) through the power of \u201crepeti-\ntion\u201d alone, which inhabits it originarily as its death. This power, that is,\nthis lack of power, which opens and limits the labor of force, institutes\ntranslatability, makes possible what we call \u201clanguage,\u201d transforms an\nabsolute idiom into a limit which is always already transgressed: a pure\nidiom is not language; it becomes so only through repetition; repetition\nalways already divides the point of departure of the \ufb01rst time. Despite\nappearances, this does not contradict what we said earlier about\nuntranslatability. At that time it was a question of recalling the origin of\nthe movement of transgression, the origin of repetition, and the becom-\ning-language of the idiom. If one limits oneself to the datum or the e\ufb00ect of\nrepetition, to translation, to the obviousness of the distinction between\nforce and meaning, not only does one miss the originality of Freud\u2019s\naim, but one e\ufb00aces the intensity of the relation to death as well.\nWe ought thus to examine closely\u2014which we cannot do here\u2014all\nthat Freud invites to think concerning writing as \u201cbreaching\u201d in the\npsychical repetition of this previously neurological notion: opening up of its\nown space, e\ufb00raction, breaking of a path against resistances, rupture\nand irruption becoming a route (rupta, via rupta), violent inscription of a\nform, tracing of a di\ufb00erence in a nature or a matter which are conceiv-\nable as such only in their opposition to writing. The route is opened in\nnature or matter, forest or wood (hyle), and in it acquires a reversibility\nwriting and difference\n268\n"

We should have to study together, genetically and\nstructurally, the history of the road and the history of writing.16 We are\nthinking here of Freud\u2019s texts on the work of the memory-trace (Erin-\nnerungsspur) which, though no longer the neurological trace, is not yet\n\u201cconscious memory,\u201d (\u201cThe Unconscious,\u201d SE XIV, 188), and of the\nitinerant work of the trace, producing and following its route, the trace\nwhich traces, the trace which breaks open its own path. The metaphor\nof pathbreaking, so frequently used in Freud\u2019s descriptions, is always in\ncommunication with the theme of the supplementary delay and with the\nreconstitution of meaning through deferral, after a mole-like progres-\nsion, after the subterranean toil of an impression. This impression has\nleft behind a laborious trace which has never been perceived, whose\nmeaning has never been lived in the present, i.e., has never been lived\nconsciously. The postscript which constitutes the past present as such is\nnot satis\ufb01ed, as Plato, Hegel, and Proust perhaps thought, with\nreawakening or revealing the present past in its truth. It produces the\npresent past. Is sexual deferral the best example or the essence of this\nmovement? A false question, no doubt: the (presumably known) subject\nof the question\u2014sexuality\u2014is determined, limited, or unlimited only\nthrough inversion and through the answer itself. Freud\u2019s answer, in any\nevent, is decisive. Take the Wolf-Man. It is by deferral that the percep-\ntion of the primal scene\u2014whether it be reality or fantasy hardly\nmatters\u2014is lived in its meaning, and sexual maturation is not the\naccidental form of this delay. \u201cAt age one and a half, he received\nimpressions the deferred understanding of which became possible for\nhim at the time of the dream through his development, exaltation and\nsexual investigations.\u201d Already in the Project, concerning repression in\nhysteria: \u201cWe invariably \ufb01nd that a memory is repressed which has\nbecome a trauma only after the event (nur nachtr\u00e4glich). The reason for\nthis state of things is the retardation (Versp\u00e4tung) of puberty as compared\nwith the remainder of the individual\u2019s development.\u201d That should\nlead, if not to the solution, at least to a new way of posing the formid-\nable problem of the temporalization and the so-called \u201ctimelessness\u201d\nof the unconscious. Here, more than elsewhere, the gap between\nFreud\u2019s intuition and his concepts is apparent. The timelessness of the\nunconscious is no doubt determined only in opposition to a common\nconcept of time, a traditional concept, the metaphysical concept: the\nfreud and the scene of writing 269\n"

If, as we shall see, he persists in giving a projective and\nspatial\u2014indeed, purely mechanical\u2014representation of energetic pro-\ncesses, it is not simply for didactic reasons: a certain spatiality, insepar-\nable from the very idea of system, is irreducible; its nature is all the\nmore enigmatic in that we can no longer consider it as the homo-\ngeneous and serene milieu of dynamic and economic processes. In the\nTraumdeutung, the metaphoric machine is not yet adapted to the scrip-\ntural analogy which already governs\u2014as shall soon be clear\u2014Freud\u2019s\nentire descriptive presentation. It is an optical machine.\nLet us return to our quotation. Freud does not want to abandon the\ntopographical model against which he has just warned us: \u201cNeverthe-\nless, I consider it expedient and justi\ufb01able to continue to make use of\nthe \ufb01gurative image (anschauliche Vorstellung: intuitive representation,\nmetaphor) of the two systems. We can avoid any possible abuse of this\nmethod of representation (mode de mise en sc\u00e8ne; Darstellungsweise) by recol-\nlecting that ideas (Vorstellungen: representations), thoughts and psychical\nstructures in general must never be regarded as localized in organic\nelements of the nervous system but rather, as one might say, between\nthem, where resistance and facilitations provide the corresponding\ncorrelates. Everything that can be an object (Gegenstand) of our internal\nperception is virtual, like the image produced in a telescope by the\npassage of light rays. But we are justi\ufb01ed in assuming the existence of\nthe systems (which are not in any way psychical entities themselves [my italics]\nand can never be accessible to our psychical perception) like the lenses\nof the telescope, which cast the image. And, if we pursue this analogy,\nwe compare the censorship between two systems to the refraction [the\nbreaking of the ray: Strahlenbrechung] which takes place when a ray of\nlight passes into a new medium\u201d (V, 61l)\nwriting and difference\n270\n"

A di\ufb00erent writing space must be found, a space\nwhich writing has always claimed for itself.\nAuxiliary apparatuses (Hilfsapparate), which, as Freud notes, are always\nconstituted on the model of the organ to be supplemented (e.g., spec-\ntacles, camera, ear trumpet) thus seem particularly de\ufb01cient when\nmemory is in question. This remark makes even more suspect the\nearlier reference to optical apparatuses. Freud recalls, nevertheless, that\nthe contradictory requirement he is presenting had already been rec-\nognized in 1900. He could have said in 1895. \u201cAs long ago as in 1900 I\ngave expression in The Interpretation of Dreams to a suspicion that this\nunusual capacity was to be divided between two di\ufb00erent systems (or\norgans of the mental apparatus). According to this view, we possess a\nsystem Pcpt.-Cs., which receives perceptions but retains no permanent\ntrace of them, so that it can react like a clean sheet to every new\nperception; while the permanent traces of the excitations which have\nbeen received are preserved in \u2018mnemic systems\u2019 lying behind the\nperceptual system. Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), I added a\nremark to the e\ufb00ect that the inexplicable phenomenon of conscious-\nness arises in the perceptual system instead of the permanent traces\u201d\n(XIX, 228).27\nA double system contained in a single di\ufb00erentiated apparatus: a\nperpetually available innocence and an in\ufb01nite reserve of traces have at\nlast been reconciled by the \u201csmall contrivance\u201d placed \u201csome time ago\nupon the market under the name of the Mystic Writing-Pad,\u201d and\nwhich \u201cpromises to perform more than the sheet of paper or the slate.\u201d\nIts appearance is modest, \u201cbut if it is examined more closely, it will be\nfound that its construction shows a remarkable agreement with my\nhypothetical structure of our perceptual apparatus.\u201d It o\ufb00ers both\nadvantages: an ever-ready receptive surface and permanent traces of the\ninscriptions that have been made on it\u201d (ibid.). Here is its description:\nThe Mystic Pad is a slab of dark brown resin or wax with a paper\nedging; over the slab is laid a thin transparent sheet, the top end of\nwhich is \ufb01rmly secured to the slab while its bottom end rests upon it\nwithout being \ufb01xed to it. This transparent sheet is the more interesting\npart of the little device. It itself consists of two layers which can be\ndetached from each other except at their two ends.

For this\npurpose no pencil or chalk is necessary, since the writing does not\ndepend on material being deposited upon the receptive surface. It is a\nreturn to the ancient method of writing upon tablets of clay or wax: a\npointed stilus scratches the surface, the depressions upon which con-\nstitute the \u201cwriting.\u201d In the case of the Mystic Pad this scratching is\nnot effected directly, but through the medium of the covering-sheet. At\nthe points which the stilus touches, it presses the lower surface of the\nwaxed paper on to the wax slab, and the grooves are visible as dark\nwriting upon the otherwise smooth whitish-gray surface of the cellu-\nloid. If one wishes to destroy what has been written, all that is neces-\nsary is to raise the double covering-sheet from the wax slab by a light\npull, starting from the free lower end.28 The close contact between the\nwaxed paper and the wax slab at the places which have been scratched\n(upon which the visibility of the writing depended) is thus brought to\nan end and it does not recur when the two surfaces come together\nonce more. The Mystic Pad is now clear of writing and ready to receive\nfresh inscriptions [XIX, 228\u201329].\nLet us note that the depth of the Mystic Pad is simultaneously a depth\nwithout bottom, an in\ufb01nite allusion, and a perfectly super\ufb01cial exter-\niority: a strati\ufb01cation of surfaces each of whose relation to itself, each\nof whose interior, is but the implication of another similarly exposed\nsurface. It joins the two empirical certainties by which we are consti-\ntuted: in\ufb01nite depth in the implication of meaning, in the unlimited\nenvelopment of the present, and, simultaneously, the pellicular essence\nof being, the absolute absence of any foundation.\nNeglecting the device\u2019s \u201cslight imperfections,\u201d interested only in\nthe analogy, Freud insists on the essentially protective nature of the\ncelluloid sheet.

There is as yet no\nwriting in the \ufb02atness of this extensia. We must account for writing as a\ntrace which survives the scratch\u2019s present, punctuality, and stigme\u00af. \u201cThis\nanalogy,\u201d Freud continues, \u201cwould not be of much value if it could not\nbe pursued further than this.\u201d This is the second analogy: \u201cIf we lift the\nentire covering-sheet\u2014both the celluloid and the waxed paper\u2014o\ufb00\nthe wax slab, the writing vanishes, and, as I have already remarked,\ndoes not re-appear again.

The\ncontradictory requirements are satis\ufb01ed by this double system, and\n\u201cthis is precisely the way in which, according to the hypothesis which I\nmentioned just now, our psychical apparatus performs its perceptual\nfunction. The layer which receives the stimuli\u2014the system Pcpt.-Cs.\u2014\nforms no permanent traces; the foundations of memory come about in\nother, supplementary, systems\u201d (ibid.).

The\nwax slab, in fact, represents the unconscious: \u201cI do not think it is\ntoo far-fetched to compare the wax slab with the unconscious behind\nthe system Pcpt.-Cs.\u201d (XIX, 230\u201331).

But it is\nbound to life and to the living present which it repeats originarily. A\npure representation, a machine, never runs by itself. Such at least is the\nlimitation which Freud recognizes in his analogy with the Mystic\nPad. Like the \ufb01rst section of the \u201cNote,\u201d his gesture at this point is\nextremely Platonic. Only the writing of the soul, said the Phaedrus, only\nthe psychical trace is able to reproduce and to represent itself spon-\ntaneously. Our reading had skipped over the following remark by\nFreud: \u201cThere must come a point at which the analogy between an\nauxiliary apparatus of this kind and the organ which is its prototype\nwill cease to apply. It is true, too, that once the writing has been erased,\nthe Mystic Pad cannot \u2018reproduce\u2019 it from within; it would be a mystic\npad indeed if, like our memory, it could accomplish that\u201d (XIX, 230).\nAbandoned to itself, the multiplicity of layered surfaces of the appar-\natus is a dead complexity without depth. Life as depth belongs only to\nthe wax of psychical memory. Freud, like Plato, thus continues to\noppose hypomnemic writing and writing en tei psychei, itself woven of\ntraces, empirical memories of a present truth outside of time. Hence-\nforth, the Mystic Pad, separated from psychical responsibility, a repre-\nsentation abandoned to itself, still participates in Cartesian space and\nmechanics: natural wax, exteriority of the memory aid.\nAll that Freud had thought about the unity of life and death, how-\never, should have led him to ask other questions here. And to ask them\nexplicitly. Freud does not explicitly examine the status of the \u201cmaterial-\nized\u201d supplement which is necessary to the alleged spontaneity of\nmemory, even if that spontaneity were di\ufb00erentiated in itself, thwarted\nby a censorhsip or repression which, moreover, could not act on a\nperfectly spontaneous memory. Far from the machine being a pure\nabsence of spontaneity, its resemblance to the psychical apparatus, its\nexistence and its necessity bear witness to the \ufb01nitude of the mnemic\nspontaneity which is thus supplemented. The machine\u2014and, con-\nsequently, representation\u2014is death and \ufb01nitude within the psyche. Nor\ndoes Freud examine the possibility of this machine, which, in the\nworld, has at least begun to resemble memory, and increasingly\nresembles it more closely. Its resemblance to memory is closer than\nthat of the innocent Mystic Pad: the latter is no doubt in\ufb01nitely more\nwriting and difference\n286\n"

But also in its most hidden sense,\nthe sense most often buried, most often diverted from itself: \u201cimplac-\nable\u201d as it is, this a\ufb03rmation has \u201cnot yet begun to exist.\u201d\nIt is still to be born. Now a necessary a\ufb03rmation can be born only by\nbeing reborn to itself. For Artaud, the future of the theater\u2014thus, the\nfuture in general\u2014is opened only by the anaphora which dates from\nthe eve prior to birth. Theatricality must traverse and restore \u201cexist-\nence\u201d and \u201c\ufb02esh\u201d in each of their aspects. Thus, whatever can be said\nof the body can be said of the theater. As we know, Artaud lived the\nmorrow of a dispossession: his proper body, the property and propri-\nety of his body, had been stolen from him at birth by the thieving god\nwho was born in order \u201cto pass himself o\ufb00 / as me.\u201d1 Rebirth doubtless\noccurs through\u2014Artaud recalls this often\u2014a kind of reeducation of\nthe organs. But this reeducation permits the access to a life before birth\nand after death (\u201c. . .through dying / I have \ufb01nally achieved real\nimmortality,\u201d p. 110), and not to a death before birth and after life.\nThis is what distinguishes the a\ufb03rmation of cruelty from romantic\nnegativity; the di\ufb00erence is slight and yet decisive. Lichtenberger: \u201cI\ncannot rid myself of this idea that I was dead before I was born, and that\nthrough death I will return to this very state. . . . To die and to be\nreborn with the memory of one\u2019s former existence is called fainting; to\nawaken with other organs which must \ufb01rst be reeducated is called\nbirth.\u201d For Artaud, the primary concern is not to die in dying, not to let\nthe thieving god divest him of his life. \u201cAnd I believe that there is\nalways someone else, at the extreme moment of death, to strip us of\nour own lives\u201d (AA, p. 162).\nSimilarly, Western theater has been separated from the force of its\nessence, removed from its a\ufb03rmative essence, its vis a\ufb03rmativa. And this\ndispossession occurred from the origin on, is the very movement of\norigin, of birth as death.\nThis is why a \u201cplace\u201d is \u201cleft on all the stages of stillborn theater\u201d\n(\u201cLe th\u00e9\u00e2 tre et l\u2019anatomie,\u201d in La rue, July 1946). The theater is born in\nits own disappearance, and the o\ufb00spring of this movement has a name:\nman. The theater of cruelty is to be born by separating death from birth\nand by erasing the name of man. The theater has always been made to\nthe theater of cruelty 293\n"

And it is into this opening that we wish\nto enter here.\nIf throughout the world today\u2014and so many examples bear witness\nto this in the most striking fashion\u2014all theatrical audacity declares its\n\ufb01delity to Artaud (correctly or incorrectly, but with increasing insist-\nency), then the question of the theater of cruelty, of its present inexist-\nence and its implacable necessity, has the value of a historic question. A\nhistoric question not because it could be inscribed within what is\ncalled the history of theater, not because it would be epoch-making\nwithin the becoming of theatrical forms, or because it would occupy a\nposition within the succession of models of theatrical representation.\nThis question is historic in an absolute and radical sense. It announces\nthe limit of representation.\nThe theater of cruelty is not a representation. It is life itself, in the extent\nto which life is unrepresentable. Life is the nonrepresentable origin of\nrepresentation. \u201cI have therefore said \u2018cruelty\u2019 as I might have said \u2018life\u2019\u201d\n(TD, p. 114).
