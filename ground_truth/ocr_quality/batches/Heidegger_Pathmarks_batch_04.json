The problem of the ayaOov is merely the \nculmination of the central and concrete question concerning the chief and \nfundamental possibility of the existence of Dasein in the polis. Even though \nthe task of an ontological projection of Dasein upon its fundamental meta\u00ad\nphysical constitution is not explicitly posed or even developed, the threefold \ncharacterization of the aya06v undertaken with constant reference to the \n\"sun\" impels us toward the question of the possibility of truth, understand\u00ad\ning, and being - i.e., taking these phenomena together, toward the question \nconcerning the originary and unitary ground of possibility of the truth of \nour understanding of being. Such understanding, however - as an unveil\u00ad\ning projecting of being - is the primordial activity of human existence, in \nwhich all existing in the midst of beings must be rooted.

Inquiry back into the intrinsic possibility of this connection sees \nitself \"compelled\" to accomplish explicitly [57] the surpassing that occurs \nnecessarily in every Dasein as such, yet mostly in a concealed manner.

This will that essentially casts the \"for the sake of itself\" \nover and thereby before Dasein cannot therefore be a particular willing, an \n\"act of will\" as distinct from other forms of comportment (such as repre\u00ad\nsenting, judging, or enjoyment).

Yet whatever, in accordance with \nits essence, casts something like the \"for the sake of\" projectively before it, \n\u00b7rather than simply producing it as an occasional and additional accomplish\u00ad\nment, is that which we call freedum. Surpassing in the direction of world is \nfreedom itself. Accordingly, transcendence does not merely come upon the \n\"for the sake of\" as anything like a value or end that would be present at \nhand in itself; rather, freedom holds the \"for the sake of\" tuward itself, and \ndoes so as freedom.

As a consequence of this origin of grounding things \nand thus also of accounting for them, it is in each case left to the freedom \nin Dasein how far to extend such grounding [66) and whether indeed it un\u00ad\nderstands how to attain an authentic grounding of things, i.e., an unveiling \nof the transcendental possibility of such grounding. Even though being \nis always unveiled in transcendence, this does not require any conceptual \nontological grasp. Thus it is altogether possible for transcendence to re\u00ad\nmain concealed as such and be familiar only in an \"indirect\" interpretation. \nYet even then it is unveiled, because it lets there be precisely beings that \nhave irrupted with the fundamental constitution ofbeing-in-the-world, and \nin this the self-unveiling of transcendence makes itself known.

Freedom in this threefold manner is freedom for \nground. The occurrence of transcendence as grounding is the forming of \na leeway into which there can irrupt the factical self-maintaining of factical \nDasein in each case in the midst of beings as a whole. \nAre we then restricting to three the four grounds discovered by the tra\u00ad\ndition, or are these three ways of grounding equivalent to the three kinds \nof ;:pwwv oOe:v in Aristotle?

The transcendental grounds \nappear merely as the \"more universal\" in relation to the on tic. The origi\u00ad\nnary character of the transcendental grounds and their specific character of \nground remain covered over beneath the formal characterization of \"first\" \nand \"highest\" beginnings. And for this reason they also lack unity. Such \nunity can consist only in the equioriginary character of the transcendental \norigin of the threefold grounding.

This can be taken \nto mean: truth is the correspondence [Angleichung] of the matter to knowl\u00ad\nedge. But it can [ 76] also be taken as saying: truth is the correspondence of \nknowledge to the matter. Admittedly, the above definition is usually stated \nonly in the formula veritas est adaequatio intellectiS ad rem [truth is the ade\u00ad\nquation of intellect to thing). Yet truth so conceived, propositional truth, \nis possible only on the basis of material truth [Sacbwahrheit], of adaequatio \nrei ad intellectum [adequation of thing to intellect]. Both concepts of the \nessence of veritns have continually in view a conforming to . . .  [Sichrichten \nnach . . .  ], and hence think truth as correctness [Richtigkeit]. \nNonetheless, the one is not the mere inversion of the other. On the \ncontrary, in each case intellectus and res are thought differently. In order \nto recognize this we must trace the usual formula for the ordinary con\u00ad\ncept of truth back to its most recent (i.e., the medieval) origin. Veritns as \nodaequntio rei ad imellectum does not imply the later transcendental concep\u00ad\ntion of Kant - possible only on the basis of the subjectivity of the human \nessence - that \"objects conform to our knowledge.\" Rather, it implies the \nChristian theological belief that, with respect to what it is and whether it \nis, a matter, as created (ens creatum), is only insofar as it corresponds to the \nideo preconceived in the intellectziS divinus, i.e., in the mind of God, and thus \nmeasures up to the idea (is correct) and in this sense is \"true.\" The intel\u00ad\nlectiS humnnus too is an ens creatum. As a capacity bestowed upon human \nbeings by God, it must satisfy its idea. But the understanding measures up \nto the idea only by accomplishing in its propositions the correspondence of \nwhat is thought to the matter, which in its tum must be in conformity with \nI j8 \n"

If all beings are \"created,\" the possibility of the truth of human \nknowledge is grounded in the fact that matter and proposition measure up \nto the idea in the same way and therefore are fitted to each other on the \nbasis of the unity of the divine plan of creation. Veritas as adoeq11atio rei \n(creandoe) ad intellectum (divinum) guarantees vn\"itas as adaequatio intellectus \n(humani) ad rem (creatam). Throughout, veritas essentially implies conve\u00ad\nnientia, the coming of beings themselves, as created, [ 77] into agreement \nwith the Creator, an \"accord\" with regard to the way they are determined \nin the order of creation. a \nBut this order, detached from the notion of creation, can also be repre\u00ad\nsented in a general and indefinite way as a world-order. The theologically \nconceived order of creation is replaced by the capacity of all objects to be \nplanned by means of a worldly reason [Weltvenunft] that supplies the law \nfor itself and thus also claims that its procedure is immediately intelligible \n(what is considered \"logical\"). That the essence of propositional truth con\u00ad\nsists in the correctness of statements is thought to need no further special \nproof.4 Even where an effon is made - with a conspicuous lack of success \u00ad\nto explain how correctness is to occur, it is already presupposed as being \nthe essence of truth. Likewise, material truth always signifies the conso\u00ad\nnance of something at hand with the \"rational\" concept of its essence. The \nimpression arises that this definition of the essence of truth is independent \nof the interpretation of the essence of the Being of all beings, which always \nincludes a corresponding interpretation of the essence of the human being \nas the bearer and executor of intellectlS. Thus the formula for the essence of \ntruth (veritas est adoeqllltio intellectus et rei) comes to have its general validity \nas something immediately evident to everyone. Under the domination of \nthe obviousness that this concept of truth seems to have, but that is hardly \nattended to as regards its essential grounds, it is considered equally obvious \nthat truthS has an opposite, and that there is untruth. The untruth of the \nproposition (incorrectness) is the nonaccordance of the statement with the \nmatter. The untruth of the matter (nongenuineness) signifies nonagree\u00ad\nment of a being with its essence. In each case untruth is conceived as a \nnonaccord. The latter falls outside the essence of truth. Therefore when it \nis a question of comprehending the pure essence of truth, untruth, as such \nan opposite of truth, can be put aside. \na First edition, 1 943: Nor a double coming into agreement, bur urtt, yer multiply articulated: \nBecause of agreement with the Creator, there is also agreement [of beings] 1111mg one tmothtr \n(since whar is created is in a ceruin way divine); Mcorrespondence\" in a more essential sense \nrhan rhar intended by the crude, unthought analogia mtis adopted from Aristotle by the \nScholastics. \n1 39 \n"

But surely for those who know about such matters the \n\"non-\" of the originary non-essence of truth, as un-truth, points to the still \nunexperienced domain of the truth of Being (not merely of beings). \nAs letting beings be, \nthe resolutely open bearing \nthat does not close up in \ncomportment [Verba/ten) is grounded \nin this bearing [Verhiilhlis] and receives from it directedness toward beings \nand disclosure of them. Nevertheless, this bearing toward concealing con\u00ad\nceals itself in letting a forgottenness of the mystery take precedence and \ndisappearing in such forgottenness. Certainly the human being takes his \nbearings [verhiilt sich) constantly in his comportment toward beings; but for \nthe most pan he acquiesces in this or that being and its particular opened\u00ad\nness. Hwnans cling to what is readily available and controllable even where \nultimate matters are concerned. And if the human being sets out to extend, \nchange, newly assimilate, or secure the openedness of the beings pertaining \nto the most various domains of his activity and interest, then he still takes \nhis directives from the sphere of readily available intentions and needs. \nHowever, to reside in what is readily available is intrinsically not to let \nthe concealing of what is concealed hold sway. Certainly, among readily fa\u00ad\nmiliar things there are also some that are puzzling, unexplained, undecided, \nquestionable. But these self-cenain questions are merely transitional, in\u00ad\ntermediate points in our movement within the readily familiar and thus not \nessential. Wherever the concealment of beings as a whole is conceded only \nas a limit that occasionally announces itself, concealing as a fundamental \noccurence has sunk into forgottenness. \n[91] But the forgotten mystery of Dasein is not eliminated by the forgot\u00ad\ntenness; rather, the forgottenness bestows on the apparent disappearance \nof what is forgotten a peculiar presence [Gegenwart]. By disavowing itself \nin and for forgottenness, the mystery leaves historical human beings in the \nsphere of what is readily available to them, leaves them to their own re\u00ad\nsources. Thus left, humanity replenishes its \"world\" on the basis of the \nlatest needs and aims, and tills out that world by means of proposing and \nplanning. From these human beings then take their standards, forgetting \nbeings as a whole. Humans persist in these standards and continually supply \nthemselves with new standards, yet without considering either the ground \nfor taking up standards or the essence of what gives the standard. In spite \nof their advance to new standards and goals, human beings go wrong as \nregards the essential genuineness of their standards.

The errancy in which any given segment of historical hu\u00ad\nmanity must proceed for its course to be errant is essentially connected \nwith the openness of Dasein. [93] By leading them astray, errancy domi\u00ad\nnates hwnan beings through and through. But, as leading astray, errancy at \nthe same time contributes to a possibility that humans are capable of draw\u00ad\ning up from their ek-sistence - the possibility that, by experiencing errancy \nitself and by not mistaking the mystery of Da-sein, they not let themselves \nbe led astray. \nBecause the hwnan being's in-sistent ek-sistence proceeds in errancy, and \nbecause errancy as leading astray always oppresses in some manner or other \nand is formidable on the basis of this oppression of the mystery, specifically \nas something forgotten, in the ek-sistence of his Dasein the human being is \nsubjected to the rule of the mystery and at the same time to the oppression \nof errancy. He is in the needfol crmdition of being constrained by the one and \nthe other. The ful essence of truth, including its most proper nonessence, \nkeeps Dasein in need by this perpetual turning to and fro. Dasein is a \nturning into need. From the Da-sein of hwnan beings and from it alone \narises the disclosure of necessity and, as a result, the possibility of being \ntransposed into what is inevitable. \nThe disclos1Jre of beings as such is \nand intrinsically the \nof \nof di\u0258e-md \nsway. \nErrancy and the concealing of what is \nconcealed belong to the originary essence of truth. Freedom, conceived \non the basis of the in-sistent ek-sistence of Dasein, is the essence of truth \n(in the sense of the correctness of presenting), only because freedom it\u00ad\nself originates from the originary essence of truth, the rule of the mys\u00ad\ntery in errancy. Letting beings be takes its course in open comportment. \nHowever, letting beings as such be as a whole occurs in a way befitting \nits essence only when from time to time it gets taken up in its originary \nessence. Then resolute openness \nzum Gebeimnis] is un er way mto errancy as such. Then the question of \nthe essence of truth gets asked more originally. Then the ground of the \nintenwining of the essence of truth with the truth of essence reveals itself. \nThe glimpse into the mystery [94] out of errancy is a questioning - in the \nsense of that unique question of what beings as such are as a whole. This \nquestioning thinks the question of the Being of beings, a question that is \nessentially misleading and thus in its manifold meaning is still not mastered. \nThe thinking of Being, from which such questioning originarily stems, has \nsimultaneously __ _ \nconcealing \nbeings -asaw~In the s1mulwicity \n~cealing, err~ holds \ntoward_!he ~y\u2022ry [d_!__e_\u00a7t-:Sf.b_/ossenheit \n----~------\n"

This essential view of the determination of \nphilosophy nevertheless goes far enough to renounce every subjugation of \nphilosophical thinking, the most destirute kind of which lets philosophy still \nbe of value as an \"expression\" of \"culrure\" (Spengler) and as an ornament \nof productive humankind. \nHowever, whether philosophy as \"keeper of its laws\" fulfills the essence \noriginarily decided for it, or whether it is not itself first of all kept and \nappointed to its task as keeper by the truth of that to which its laws in each \ncase pertain - this depends on the primordiality with which the original \nessence of truth becom_es essential for thoughtful questioning. \nThe present undertaking takes the question of the essence of truth be\u00ad\nyond the confines of the ordinary definition provided in the usual concept \nof essence and helps us to [96] consider whether the question of the essence \nof truth must not be, at the same time and even first of all, the question \nconcerning the truth of essence. But in the concept of \"essence\" philos\u00ad\nophy thinks Being. In tracing the inner possibility of the correctness of \nstatements back to the ek-sistent freedom of letting-be as its \"ground,\" \nand likewise in pointing to the essential begining of this ground in con\u00ad\ncealing and in errancy, we want to show that the essence of truth is not \nthe empty \"generality\" of an \"abstract\" universality but rather that which, \nself-concealing, is unique in the unremitting history of the disclosure of \nthe \"meaning\" of what we call Being - what we for a long time have been \naccustomed to considering only as beings as a whole. \n9\u00b7 NOTE \nThe question of the essence of truth arises from the question of the truth \nof essence. In the former question essence is understood initially in the \nsense of whatness (quidditns) or material content (realitos), whereas truth is \nunderstood as a characteristic of knowledge. In the question of the truth of \nessence, essence is understood verbally; in this word, remaining still within \nmetaphysical presentation, Beyng is thought as the difference that holds \nsway between Being and beings. Truth signifies sheltering that clears [licht\u00ad\nmdes Bergen) as the fundamental trait of Being. The question of the essence \nof truth finds its answer in the proposition the essmce of truth is the truth of \nessmce. After our explanation it can easily be seen that the proposition does \nnot merely reverse the word order so as to conjure the specter of paradox. \nThe subject of the proposition - if this unforrunate grammatical category \n153 \n"

      "full_text": "PLATO'S DOCTRINE OF TRUTH \ncharacter on someone and guiding someone by a paradigm. The contrary \nof r:a\u0004oE(a is a7ta\u0004O\u20ac'Jo(a, lack of formation, where no fundamental bearing \nis awakened and unfolded, and where no normative proto-type is put forth. \nThe \"allegory of the cave\" concentrates its explanatory power on making \nus able to see and know the essence of 1ta\u0004oda by means of the concrete \nimages recounted in the story. At the same time Plato seeks to avoid false \ninterpretations; he wants to show that the essence of 7taLoda does not consist \nin merely pouring knowledge into the unprepared soul as if it were some \ncontainer held out empty and waiting. On the contrary real education lays \nhold of the soul itself and transforms it in its entirety by first of all leading \nus to the place of our essential being and accustoming us to it. That the \n\"allegory of the cave\" is meant to illustrate the essence of 1ta\u0004oda is stated \nclearly enough in the very sentence with which Plato introduces the story \nat the beginning of Book Seven: Mna \"tllU\"tll o<. Ebtov, Q7t\u20acLXIlO'OV 'tmOU\"t\u0105 \n;ta9\u20acL \"t\u001eV \u0106flEttpav rpuoLv 7tllLO\u20acLac; \"t\u20ac lttpL xal altllLOEIJO'(ac;. \"And after that, \ntry to conjure up for yourself from the kind of experience (to be presented \nin the following story) a view (of the essence) both of'education' and of the \nlack of education, [ 1 24] both of which (as belonging together) concern the \nvery foundation of our being as humans.\" \nPlato's assertion is clear: The \"allegory of the cave\" illustrates the essence \nof \"education.\" By contrast, the interpretation of the \"allegory\" that we \nare now going to attempt means to point out the Platonic \"doctrine\" of \ntruth. Are we not then burdening the \"allegory\" with something foreign to \nit? The interpretation threatens to degenerate into a reinterpretation that \ndoes violence to the text. Let this appearance stand until we have confirmed \nour insight that Plato's thinking subjects itself to a transformation in the \nessence of truth that becomes the hidden law governing what the thinker \nsays. According to our interpretation, which is made necessary from out of \na future need, the \"allegory\" not only illustrates the essence of education \nbut at the same time opens our eyes to a transformation in the essence of \n\"truth.\" If the \"allegory\" can show both, must it not be the case that an \nessential relation holds between \"education\" and \"truth\"? This relation \ndoes, in fact, obtain. And it consists in the fact that the essence of truth and \nthe sort of transformation it undergoes here first make possible \"education\" \nin its basic structures. \nBut what is it that links \"education\" and \"truth\" together into an original \nand essential unity? \nII :ulid:x means turning around the whole human being. It means remov\u00ad\ning human beings from the region where they first encounter things and \ntransferring and accustoming them to another realm where beings appear. \n"
