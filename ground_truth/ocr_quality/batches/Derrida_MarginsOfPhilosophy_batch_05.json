Theological\ncertitude is accommodated to a natural explanation according to a very classical\nframework in which the concepts of nature, experience, creation, and fall are\nstrictly inseparable. (The most remarkable example of such a \"system\" is doubt-\nless that of Malebranche, which I am recalling here only because of its well-\nknown influence on Rousseau.) Here, the event of the flood, whose analog will\nbe found in Rousseau, liberates the functioning of the natural explanation.\nThis does not prevent Rousseau from taking his leave from Condillac precisely\nat the point at which he reproaches Condillac for taking as given that which is\nto be explained, that is, \"a kind of already established society among the in-\nventors of language.\" Rousseau reproaches Condillac less for rejecting every\nmodel of natural explanation\u2014that would be untrue\u2014than for not radicalizing\nhis concept of nature: Condillac would not have descended to a pure state of\nnature to analyze the emergence of language: \"Permit me for a moment to\nconsider all the confusions of the origin of Languages. I could content myself\nwith citing or repeating here all of Abb\u00e9 de Condillac's investigations into this\nmatter, which fully confirm my feeling, and which, perhaps, gave me my first\nideas. But given the manner in which this Philosopher resolves the difficulties\nhe creates for himself on the origin of institutionalized signs, that is, a kind of\nalready established society among the inventors of language, I believe that in\nreferring to his reflections I must add to them my own.\"6\nThus Condillac seems to have committed what Rousseau a little further on\ncalls \"the fault of those who, reasoning on the State of Nature, transport into\nit ideas taken from Society.\"\nThe properly scientific concern, therefore, is indicated by the decision to refer\nonly to purely natural cuases. Such is the motif on which the Essay on the Origin\nof Languages7 opens, from its very first paragraph: \"In order to tell, it is necessary\nto go back to some principle that belongs to the locality itself and antedates its\ncustoms, for speech, being the first social institution, owes its form to natural\n4.

Now, without even entering into the content of the natural\ngenealogy of language that Rousseau proposes, let us note that the so-called\n\"epistemological break\" paradoxically corresponds to a kind of break in the field\nof natural causality. If \"speech,\" \"the first social institution, owes its form to\nnatural causes alone,\"8 then the latter, themselves acting as a force of break with\nnature, naturally inaugurate an order radically heterogeneous to the natural order.\nThe two\u2014apparently contradictory\u2014conditions for the constitution of a scientific\nfield and object, here language, would thus be fulfilled: a natural, a continuously\nnatural causality, and a break designating the irreducible autonomy and origi-\nnality of a domain. The question of the origin is in itself suspended, in that it\nno longer calls for a continuous, real, and natural description, being but the\nindex of an internal structural description.\nCertainly all this is neither without difficulty nor without a certain apparent\nincoherence, for which Rousseau often has been reproached. And it has been\nthat much easier to make this reproach because Rousseau himself on several\noccasions seems to renounce the natural explanation and to admit a kind of\nviolent\u2014catastrophic\u2014interruption into the concatenation of natural causality.\nAn arbitrary interruption, an interruption of the arbitrary, the decision which\npermits only the arbitrary and the conventional to be instituted. One comes\nback to the necessity of this question wherever the conceptuality organized\naround the opposition nature/arbitrary is accredited. Before defining the neces-\nsity both of the break and the at least apparent failure, before underlining the\nscientific and heuristic motivation that accommodates its opposite here, let us\nbriefly recall its well known points of apparition.\n1. After attempting, by means of a fiction, a derivation of languages on the\nbasis of a primitive dispersion in the state of pure nature, on the basis of the\nbiological nucleus uniting mother and child, Rousseau has to step back and\nsuppose \"this first difficulty overcome\": \"Notice again that the Child having all\nhis needs to explain, and consequently more things to say to the Mother than\nthe Mother to the Child, it is he who must bear the burden of invention, and\nthat the language he employs must in great part be his own handiwork; which\n8. Attention must be paid to the word \"form\": natural causes must produce the variety\nof forms of speech as the variety of languages. The Essay accounts for this by means of\nphysics, geography, and cliniatology. This distinction between speech itself and languages\nunderlies the notion of form at the beginning of the Essay: \"Speech distinguishes man\namong the animals; language distinguishes nations from each other; one does not know\nwhere a man comes from until he has spoken. Out of usage and necessity, each learns\nthe language of his own country. But what determines that this language is that of his\ncountry and not that of another? In order to tell, it is necessary to go back to some principle\nthat belongs to the locality itself and antedates its customs, for speech, being the first\nsocial instituiton, owes its form to natural causes alone\" (p. 5). But the text that follows\nperhaps permits an extension of the variety of forms beyond the diversity of oral languages\nto include the multiplicity of \"substances of expressions,\" the means of communication.\nThese natural means are the senses, and each sense has its language. See below, \"The\nClosure of Concepts.\"\n143\n"

But these\napparent, and apparently avowed, confusions have a reverse side for which in\na way they pay the price. The circle, as a vicious circle, a logical circle, by the\nsame token constitutes the rigorously limited, closed, and original autonomy of\na field. If there is no entry into the circle, if it is closed, if one is always already\nset down within it, if it has always already begun to carry us along in its\nmovement, no matter where it is entered, it is because the circle forms a perfectly\nunderivable figure and does so by means of a continuous causality, something\nother than itself. It has been posited decisively by an absolute, and absolutely\nirruptive, initiative, making it simultaneously open and dosed. Society, lan-\nguage, convention, history, etc., together with all the possibilities that go along\nwith them, form a system, an organized totality which, in its orginality, can be\nthe object of a theory. Beyond its negative and sterilizing effects, beyond the\nquestion which it seems incapable of answering logically, the \"logical circle\"\npositively delimits an epistemological cirde, a field whose objects will be specific.\nThe condition for the study of this field as such is that the genetic and factual\nderivation be interrupted. Ideal genealogy or structural description: such is Rous-\nseau's project. Let us cite this text once more: \"Let us begin by setting aside all\nthe facts, for they do not touch upon the question. The Investigations one may\nenter into on this subject must not be taken as historical truths, but only as\nhypothetical and conditional reasoning; more apt to enlighten the Nature of\nthings than to show their veritable origin, and similar to the Investigations made\nevery day by our Physicians concerning the formation of the World.\"2\n3. This is what accounts for the absolutely unforeseeeable intervention, in the\nEssay, of the \"slight movement\" of a finger which produces the birth of society\nand languages. Since the system of the state of Nature could not depart from\nitself, could not itself depart from itself (Discourse, p. 162), could not spontaneously\ninterrupt itself, some perfectly exterior causality had to come to provoke\u2014ar-\nbitrarily\u2014this departure, which is none other, precisely, than the possibility of the\ntaste that I had for him [M. Salomon] extended to the subjects of which he treated, and\nI began to seek out books which could help me better to understand him. Those which\nmixed devoutness with the sciences suited me best; such, particularly, were those of the\nOratoire and of Port-Royal. I set myself to reading them, or rather to devouring them. Of\nthese, one fell into my hands by Father Lamy, entitiled Enfretiens sur les sciences. It was a\nkind of introduction to the knowledge of the books on this topic. I read and reread it a\nhundred times; I resolved to make it my guide\" (p. 232). One might pick out more than\none correspondence between the two theories of language, notably as concerns the re-\nlations between speech and writing. In Father Lamy's Rhetoric one may read: \"Words on\npaper are like a dead body laid out on the ground. In the mouth of whoever proffers them\nthey are efficacious; on paper they are without life, incapable of producing the same\neffects.\" And \"a written discourse is dead,\" \"the tone, gestures, and air of the face of the\nspeaker support his words\" (cited by Rodin-Lewis, p. 27).\n12.

In doing so, even while respecting the original order\nof language and society, he correlates this order, and systematically maintains\nthis correlation, with the order of nature, primarily witi. the geological or geo-\ngraphical order of his nature. Thereby the typology of languages, in the Essay,\nwill conform to a general topology, and \"local difference\" will be taken into\naccount in the origin of languages (chap. 8). Corresponding to the opposition\nsouth/north is the opposition of languages of passion to languages of need,\nare distinguished by the predominance granted to accentuation in the\none and articulation in the other, to the vowel in one and to the consonant in\nthe other, to metaphor in One and to exactness and correctness in the other. The\nlatter\u2014the languages of the north\u2014lend themselves more easily to writing; the\nformer naturally reject it. Thus we have a\nof correlations. At the pole of\nthe origin, at the point of greatest proximity to The birth of language, there is\nthe chain origin-life-south-summer-heat-passion-accentuation-vowel-meta-\nphor-song, etc. At the other pole, to the extent that one departs from the ori-\ngin:\ndecadence-illness-death-north-winter-cold-reason-articulation-consonant-\ncorrectness-prose-writing. But, by a strange motion, the more one departs from\nthe origin, the more one tends to come back to what precedes it, to a nature\nwhich has not yet awakened to speech and to everything that is born along with\nspeech. And, between the two polar series, regulated relations of supplemen-\ntarity: the second series is added to the first in order to be substituted for it, but,\nin supplementing a lack in the first series, also to add something new, an addition,\nan accident, an excess that should not have overtaken the first series. In doing this,\nthe second series will hollow out a new lack or will enlarge the original lack,\nwhich will call for a new supplement, etc. The same logic is at work in the\nhistoric and systematic classification of writings: corresponding to the three\nstates of man in society (savage, barbaric, or policed peoples) are three types\nof writings (pictographic, ideographic, phonetic).\nBut, although writing has a\n16.

The depicting of objects\nis appropriate to a savage people; signs of words and of propositions to a barbaric people;\nand the alphabet to civilized (polices) peoples\" (Essay. p. 17). \"To the preceding division\nthere correspond the three conditions of man considered in relation to society. The savage\nis a hunter, the barbarian is a herdman, and civil man is a tiller of the soil\" (p. 38).\n147\n"

In reinscribing\nthe Greek words (eidos, morphe, etc.) into phenomenological language, in playing\non the differences between Greek, Latin, and German, Husserl certainly wished\nto deliver these concepts from the latter-day metaphysical interpretations that\nhad overtaken them, accusing these interpretations of having deposited, in the\nword itself, the entire burden of an invisible sedimentation.3 But Husserl always\ndoes so in order to reconstitute (and, if need be, against the founders, against\nPlato and Aristotle), an original sense that began by being perverted immediately\nupon its inscription into tradition.

The transcendental\ndescription of the fundamental structures of all experience is pursued up to the\nend of the penultimate \"section\" without even touching upon the problem of\nlanguage. The worlds of culture and of science indeed have been evoked, but\neven if the predicates of culture and of science are unthinkable outside a world\nof language, Husserl gave himself the right, for methodological reasons, not to\nconsider the \"layer\" of expression, provisionally putting it between parentheses.\nHusserl can give himself this right only by supposing that expressivity con-\nstitutes an original and rigorously delimited \"stratum\" (Schicht) of experience.\nThe Investigations had proposed an insistent demonsiration that acts of expres-\nsion are original and irreducible; and this remains presupposed in Ideas. Thus,\nat a certain moment of the descriptive itinerary, one may come to consider\nlinguistic expressivity as a circumscribed problem. And at the point at which\nthe problem is approached, one already knows that the \"stratum of logos\" will\nbe included in the most general structure of experience, the structure whose poles\nor correlations have just been described: the parallel opposition of noesis and\nnoema. Thus, it is already a given that however original, the stratum of the\nlogos would have to be organized according to the parallelism of noesis and\nnoema. The problem of \"meaning\" (bedeuten)4 is approached in section 124,\nwhich is entitled \"The Noetic-Noematic Stratum of the 'Logos.' Meaning and\nMeaning Something (Bedeuten und Bedeutung).\" The metaphor of the stratum\n(Schichf) has two implications. On the one hand, meaning is founded on some-\nthing other than itself, and this dependence will be confirmed ceaselessly by\nHusserl's analysis. On the other hand, meaning constitutes a stratum whose\nunity can be rigorously delimited. Now, if the metaphor of the stratum remains\ncredible throughout this section, it will become suspect in the section's final\nlines. This suspicion is not purely rhetorical but, rather, translates a profound\ndisquiet as concerns the descriptive fidelity of discourse. If the metaphor of the\nstratum does not correspond to the structure one seeks to describe, how could\nit have been used for so long? \"For we should not hold too hard by the metaphor\nof stratification (Schichtung); expression is not of the nature of an overlaid varnish\n(ubergelagerter Lack) or covering garment; it is a mental formation (geistige For-\ntnung), which exercises new intentional influences (Funktionen) on the intentional\nsubstratum (an der intentionalen Untershicht) and experiences from the latter cor-\nrelative intentional influences\"5 (p. 349).\n4.

His patience and\nscrupulousness must, in principle, undo the tangle. At stake is phenomenology's\n\"principle of principles.\" If the description does not bring to light an absolutely\nand simply founding ground of signification, if an intuitive and perceptive\nground, a pedestal of silence, does not found discourse in the originally given\npresence of the thing itself, if the texture of the text, in a word, is irreducible,\nnot only will the phenomenological description have failed but the descriptive\n\"principle\" itself will have been put back into quesiton. The stakes of this\ndisentanglement are therefore the phenomenological motif itself.\nMirror Writing\nHusserl begins by delimiting the problem, by simplifying or purifying its givens.\nHe then proceeds to a double exclusion, or if you will, to a double reduction,\nbowing to a necessity whose rightful status was acknowledged in the Investi-\ngat ions, and which will never again be put into question. On the one hand, the\nsensory face of language, its sensory and nonmaterial face, what might be called\nthe animate \"proper body\" (Leib) of language, is put out of circulation. Since,\naccording to Husserl, expression supposes an intention of meaning (Bedeutungs-\nintention), its essential condition is therefore the pure act of animating intention,\nand not the body to which, in some mysterious fashion, intention unites itself\nand gives life. It is this enigmatic unity of informing intention and informed\nmatter that Husserl authorizes himself to dissociate from the outset. This is why,\non the other hand, he defers\u2014forever, it seems\u2014the problem of the unity of the\ntwo faces, the problem of the union of soul and body. \"Let us start from the\nfamiliar distinction between the sensory, the so to speak bodily aspect (leiNiche\nSeite) of expression, and its nonsensory 'mental' aspect.

This question will receive its full\nformulation only after a certain progress of the analysis: \"how to interpret the\n'expressing' of 'what is expressed,' how expressed experiences stand in relation\nto those that are not expressed, and what changes the latter undergo when\nexpression supervenes; one is then led to the question of their 'intentionality,'\nof their 'immanent meaning,' of their 'content' (Mat erie) and quality (i.e. the act-\ncharacter of the thesis), of the distinction of this meaning and these phases of\nthe essence which lie in the pre-expressive from the meaning of the expressing\nphenomenon itself and its own phases, and so forth. One gathers still in various\nways from the writings of the day how little justice is apt to be done to the great\nproblems here indicated in their full and deep-lying significance\" (p. 348).\nCertainly this problem already had been posed, notably at the beginning of\nthe sixth of the Logical Investigations. But here, the path which leads to it is\ndifferent; and not only for very general reasons (access to an openly transcen-\ndental problematic, appeal to the notion of noema, acknowledged generality of\nthe noetico-noematic structure), but particularly because of the distinction, arisen\nin the interval, between the concepts of Sinn and Bedeutung. Not that Husserl\nnow accepts this distinction proposed by Frege, one that he had objected to in\nthe Investigations.8 Rather, he simply finds it convenient to reserve the pair be-\ndeuten-Bedeutung for the order of expressive meaning (vouloir-dire), for discourse\nitself, and to extend the concept of sense (Sinn) to the totality of the noematic\nface of experience, whether or not it is expressive.9\nOnce the extension of sense absolutely overflows the extension of meaning,\ndiscourse will always have to draw upon its sense.

This is one of the\nreasons why the essence of logical meaning is determined as expression (A us-\ndruck). Discourse is expressive in its essence, because it consists in transporting\nto the outside, in exteriorizing a content of interior thought. It is never without\nthe sich \u00e4usseru which was spoken of in the first of the Investigations (sec. 7).\nThus, we are already in possession of the first distinctive trait of the expressive\nstratum. If it proffers only a constituted sense, physically or not, it is essentially\nreproductive, that is, unproductive. Husserl's analysis is on its way to this defi-\nnition in its first stage: \"The stratum of expression\u2014and this constitutes its\npeculiarity\u2014apart from the fact that it lends expression to all other intention-\nalities, is not productive. Or if one prefers: its productivity, its noematic service,\nexhausts itself in expressing, and in the form of the conceptual which first comes with\nthe expressing\" (pp. 348-49).\nThis unproductivity of the logos is embodied, if we may put it thus, in the\nHusserlian description. It again permits itself to be seduced by two metaphors\nto which we cannot not pay attention.\nThe first seems to pass by Husserl unnoticed. It is displaced between a writing\nand a mirror. Or rather, it says mirror writing. Let us follow its constitution.\nIn order to set forth the difference between Sinn and Bedeutung, Husserl recurs\nto a perceptual example, the silent perception of a \"white thing.\" In a certain\nway, the statement \"this is white\" is perfectly independent of the perceptual\nexperience. It is even intelligible for someone who has not had this perception.\nAnd the Investigations had demonstrated this rigorously. This independence of\nthe expressive value equally implies the independence of the perceptual sense.\nWe can make this sense explicit: \"This process makes no call whatsoever on\n'expression,' neither on expression in the sense of verbal sound nor on the like\nas verbal meaning, and here the latter can also be present independently of the\nverbal sound (as in the case when this sound is 'forgotten')\" (p. 347).\nConsequently, the transition to being stated adds nothing to sense, or in any'\nevent adds no content of sense; and yet, despite this sterility, or rather because\nof it, the appearance of expression is rigorously new. Because it only reissues\nthe noematic sense, in a certain way, expression is rigorously novel. To the\nextent that it neither adds nor in any way deforms, expression can always in\nprinciple repeat sense, by providing access to \"conceptual form\": \"If we have\n'thought' or stated 'This is white,' a new stratum is there with the rest, and unites\nideality of the work of art and of its relations to perception account for the differences\nbetween the musical and the plastic work, between the literaiy and the nonliterary work\nin general? And, moreover, do the precautions taken by Husserl concerning the originality\nof the imaginary, even at their most revolutionary, suffice to lift the work of art from an\nentire metaphysics of art as reproduction, from a mimetics? One could show that art,\naccording to Husserl, always refers to perception as to its ultimate resource. And is it not\nalready an aesthetic and metaphysical decision to offer works of art as examples in a theory\nof the imaginary?\n163\n"

Thus, everything must be capable\nof being said, everything must be capable of attaining the conceptual generality\nwhich properly constitutes the logic of the logos. And this not despite but\nbecause of the originality of the logical medium of expression: in effect, this\noriginality consists in not having to erase itself as an unproductive transparency\nfacing the passageway of sense.\nBut this transparency must have some consistency: not only in order to express,\nbut primarily in order to let itself be impressed by what afterward it will give to\nbe read: \"From the noetic standpoint the rubric 'expressing' should indicate a\nspecial act-stratum to which all other acts must adjust themselves in their own\nway, and with which they must blend remarkably in such wise that every no-\nematic act-sense, and consequently the relation to objectivity which lies in it,\nstamps itself (sick auspragt: impresses, strikes itself) 'conceptually' (begrifflich) in\nthe noematic phase of the expressing\" (p. 347).\nThus, the preexpressive noema, the prelinguistic sense, must be imprinted\nin the expressive noema, must find its conceptual mark in the content of mean-\ning.

Following the implacable necessity\nof these two concepts, production and revelation are united in the impression-\nexpression of discourse. And since Husserl, here, is not considering the verbal\norder, with all its \"entangled\" (physical and intentional) complexity, but the still\nsilent intention of meaning (the moment when Bedeutung has appeared, which\nis more than sense, but has not yet effectively and physically proffered itself),\nit must be concluded that sense in general, the noematic sense of every expe-\nrience, is something which by its nature already must be capable of imprinting\nitself in a meaning, leaving or receiving its formal mark in a Bedeutung.

In particular, if there is an original history and permanence of con-\ncepts\u2014such as they are already and uniquely inscribed in meaning, supposing\nthat meaning can be separated from the history of language and of signifiers\u2014\nconcepts themselves are always older than sense, and in turn constitute a text.\nEven if, in principle, one could suppose that some textual virginity in jib\nfern pore\nwelcomed the first production of sense, in fact the systematic order of meaning\nin some way would have had to impose its sense upon sense, dictating the form\nof sense, obliging it to imprint itself according to a given rule, syntactic or\notherwise. And this \"in fact\" is not one empirical necessity among others; it\ncannot be put between parentheses in order to pose transcendental questions\nof rightfulness, since the status of meaning cannot be fixed without simulta-\nneously determining the status of sense. The placing of this \"fact\" between\nparentheses is a decision concerning the status of sense in general in its relations\nto discourse. This gesture does not come out of phenornenology, but opens it noncriticalby.\nAnd although Husserl never afterward put this juridical \"anteriority\" of sense\nin relation to meaning (of Sinn in relation to bedeu ten) back into question, it is\ndifficult to see how it can be reconciled with his future thematic, for example\nthat of The Origin of Geometry. This thematic is simultaneously, and quite precisely,\nthe one which we are following at the moment and that of a sedimented history\nof bedeuten. And even if one considers only egological history, how is the per-\npetual restoration of meaning in its virginity to be thought?\nHowever, the scriptural analogy does not hold Husserl's attention here. An-\nother metaphor demands it.\nThe milieu that receives the imprint would be neutral. Husserl has just evoked\nconceptual Auspragung. He then determines the neutrality of the milieu as that\nof a medium without its own color, without a determined opaqueness, without\npower to refract. But this neutrality, then, is less that of transparency than that\nof specular reflection: \"A peculiar intentional instrument lies before us which\nessentially possesses the outstanding characteristic of reflecting back as from a\nmirror (widerzuspiegeln) every other intentionality according to its form and con-\ntent, of copying (abzubiiden) it whilst colouring it in its own way, and thereby\nof working into (cinzubiiden) it its own form of 'conceptuality' \" (pp. 347-48).\nA double effect of the milieu, a double relation of logos to sense: on the one\nhand, a pure and simple reflection, a reflection that respects what it accepts, and\nrefers, de-picts, sense as such, in its proper original colors, re-presenting it in\nperson. This is language as Abbildung (copy, portrait, figuration, representation).\nBut, on the other hand, this reproduction imposes the blank mark of the concept.\nIt informs meaning with sense, producing a specific nonproduction which, with-\nout changing anything in sense, paints something in it.

In any event Husserl displays a certain discomfort.\nAnd there would be much to think about in Husserl's attribution of the indecision\nof his description to the accidental metaphoricity of language, to precisely what\nhe calls the Bildlichkeit of discourse. It is because discourse occasionally must\nutilize images, figures, and analogies\u2014which would be as its debris\u2014that logos\nmust be described simultaneously as the unproductivity of the Abbildung and\nas the productivity of the Einbildung. If one eliminated the Bildlichkeit in descrip-\ntive discourse, by the same token one would eliminate the apparent contradiction\nbetween Abbildung and Einbildung. But Husserl does not ask about this nuclear\nbilden in its relations to logos.

There is no scientific sense (Sinn) without meaning (bedeu ten),\nbut it belongs to the essence of science to demand an unequivocality without\nshadow, the absolute transparence of discourse. Science would need what it\nneeds (discourse as pure meaning) to be useless: it is only to preserve and to\nglance at the sense which science confers upon it. Nowhere else can discourse\nsimultaneously be more productive and more unproductive than as an element\nof theory.\nWhich indeed confirms\u2014if this unproductive prpductivity is the telos of expres-\nsion\u2014that logico-scientific discourse has never ceased to function, here, as the\nmodel of every possible discourse.\nThe entire analysis, henceforth, will have to be displaced between two con-\ncepts or two values. On the one hand, ideal discourse will have to accomplish\nan overlapping or a coincidence (Deckung) of the nonexpressive stratum of sense\nand of the expressive stratum of meaning.

The example\nHusserl has just cited in effect belongs to the language of daily life, and it may\nstill be assumed that the mission and power of scientific expression consist in\nmastering these shadows and restituting the completeness of the sense aimed\nat in expression.\nAt the risk of compromising an axiom (the unproductive and reflective value\nof expression), Husserl also brings to light an essential noncompletion of expres-\nsion, an insufficiency that no effort ever will be able to overcome, precisely\nbecause it has to do with conceptual form, the\nformality without which\nexpression would not be what it is. Although Husserl, above, apparently wanted\nto stress the reflective, reproductive, repetitive nature of expression, its Abbilden,\nthereby neutralizing, in return, its effects, and its marks, its power to deform\nor refract, that is, its Einbilden, now, on the other hand, he stresses an essential\ndisplacement of expression that will forever prevent it from\nthe stratum\nof sense (Sinn): and this difference is nothing less than the difference of the\nconcept. We must read the entire paragraph: \"An incompleteness of a totally\ndifferent kind (Eine total andere Unvollstandigkeit) from the one just discussed is\nthat which belongs to the essential nature of the expression as such, namely,\nto its generality (Ailgemeinheit). 'I would like,' expresses the wish in a general\nform; the form of command, the command; 'might very well be' the presumption,\nor the likely as such, and so forth. Every closer determination in the unity of\nthe expression is itself again expressed in general form. It lies in the meaning\nof the generality which belongs to the essential nature of the expressing function\nthat it would not ever be possible for all the specifications of the expressed to\nbe reflected (sich reflektieren) in the expression. The stratum of the meaning\nfunction is not, and in principle is not, a sort of duplication (Reduplikation) of\nthe lower stratum\" (p. 352).\nAnd referring to the entire problematic of complete and incomplete expres-\nsions in the Logical Investigations, Husserl then mentions the values of the un-\nderlying layer which in principle cannot be repeated in expression (the qualities\nof darity, of distinction, attentional modifications, etc.).\nThis impoverishment is the condition for scientific formalization. Unequivo-\ncality is furthered in the extent to which the complete repetition of sense in\nmeaning is given up. Therefore, one cannot even say that a factual, accidental,\ninessential noncompleteness is reduced via a teleology of scientific discourse,\nor that it is included as a provisional obstacle within the horizon of an infinite\ntask. The felos of scientific discourse bears within itself, as such, a renunciation\nof completeness. Here, the difference is not a provisional deficiency of the\n168\n"

In other words, if we consider the history of philosophy\nas one great discourse, a powerful discursive chain, is not that history immersed\nin a reserve of language, the systematic reserve of a lexicology, a grammar, a set\nof signs and values? And once this is so, is not the history of philosophy limited\nby the resources and the organization of that reserve?\nHow to determine this language of philosophy? Is it a \"natural language,\" or\na family of natural languages (Greek, Latin, Germanic, Indo-European, etc.)?\nIs it rather a formal code elaborated on the basis of these natural languages?\nThese questions have an old history, doubtless going back to the origin of phi-\nlosophy itself. But they cannot be reelaborated without displacing the pairs of\nconcepts which constitute philosophy. These pairs, for example natural lan-\nguage/formal language, language/speech, etc. having been produced by philo-\nsophical discourse, belong to the field which they are to dominate; which,\nwithout stripping them of all authority, makes them incapable of mastering the\nrelation of philosophical \"discourse\" to its constraints.\nMoreover, at a given moment these questions, which long remained special\nand virtual ones, become dominant and obsessing. This is certainly not insig-\nnificant as concerns the \"historical\" relation of philosophy to its proper limit\nand to the singular form of this closure. This singularity is manifested regularly\nalong the lines of the following turn: whoever alleges that philosophical discourse\nbelongs to the closure of a language must still proceed within this language and\nwith the oppositions it furnishes. According to a law that can be formalized,\nphilosophy always reappropriates for itself the discourse that de-limits it.\nFinally, although the question about these linguistic constraints has a certain\nphilosophical permanence, the form in which we are advancing the question\ntoday has doubtless been constituted within a very particular and very complex\nhistorico-theoretical configuration. This configuration is bound to numerous\nfields of criticism but above all remains inseparable from the development of\nhistorical linguistics in the nineteenth century. In reminding the philosopher\nthat he remains endosed in a language, Nietzsche was surely more violent and\nmore explicit than anyone else, but he was also exploiting a possibility that had\nbeen coming to the surface almost everywhere for a half century, even if most\noften reappropriated by philosophical interest. In this situation, Nietzschean\ndiscourse, no more than any other,\nnot simply escape the law of reap-\npropriation. For example, Nietzsche determines as liberation (or liberty of\nthought) the movement which ilnally would free us from the language and\ngrammar that until now have governed the philosophical order. Quite tradi-\ntionally, he thus comes to define the law of language or of the signifier as a\n\"slavery\" from which one must be freed, and, at the most critical or \"overturn-\n177\n"
