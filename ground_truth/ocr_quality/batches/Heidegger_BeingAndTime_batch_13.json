When, however, one's existence is \ninauthentically historical, it is loaded down with the legacy of a 'past' \nwhich has become unrecognizable, and it seeks the modem. But when \nhistoricality is authentic, it understands history as the 'recurrence' of the \n392 \npossible, and knows that a possibility will recur only if existence is open \nfor it fatefully, in a moment of vision, in resolute repetition. \nThe existential Interpretation of Dasein's historicality is constantly \ngetting eclipsed unawares. The obscurities are all the harder to dispel when \nwe have not disentangled the possible dimensions of the appropriate \ninquiry, and when everything is haunted by the enigma of Being, and, as \nhas now been made plain, by that of motion. 2 Nevertheless, we may venture \na projection of the ontological genesis of historiology as a science in terms \nof Dasein's historicality. This projection will serve to prepare us for the \nclarification of the task of destroying the history of philosophy historio\u00ad\nlogically-a clarification which is to be accomplished in what follows.x \n\u00df ;6. The Existential Source of Historiology in Dasein's Historicality. \nWe need not discuss the Fact that historiology, like any science, is, as \na kind of Being of Dasein, factically 'dependent' at any time on the \n'prevailing world-view'. Beyond this, we must inquire into the ontological \npossibility of how the sciences have their source in Dasein's state of Being. \nThis source is still not very transparent. In the context which lies before \nus, our analysis will acquaint us in outline with the existential source of \nhistoriology only to the extent of bringing still more plainly to light the \n\u00b7 historicality of Dasein and the fact that this historicality is rooted in \ntemporality. \nIf Dasein's Being is in principle historical, then every factical science is \nalways manifestly in the grip of this historizing. But historiology still has \nDasein's historicality as its presupposition in its own quite special way. \nThis can be made plain, in the first instance, by the suggestion that \nhistoriology, as the science of Dasein's history, must 'presuppose' as its \npossible 'Object' the entity which is primordially historical. But history must \nnot only be, in order that a historiological object may become accessible; \nand historiological cognition is not only historical, as a historizing way in \nwhich Dasein comports itself. Whether the historiological disclosure of history \nis factically accomplished or not, its ontological structure is such that in itself \nthis disclosure has its roots in the historicality of Dasein. This is the connection \nwe have in view when we talk of Dasein's historicality as the existential \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n eine Entgegenwiirtigung des Heute . . .  \n' \nll \n' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n und in allem das Riitsel des Seins und, wie jetzt deutlich wurde, der Bewegung \nsein Wesen treibt.' \n"

The question of whether the object of historiology is just \nto put once-for-all 'individual' events into a series, or whether it also has \n'laws' as its objects, is one that is radically mistaken. The theme of \nhistoriology is neither that which has happened just once for all nor \nsomething universal that floats above it, but the possibility which has \nbeen factically existent.1 This possibility does not get repeated as such\u00ad\nthat is to say, understood in an authentically historiological way-if it \nbecomes perverted into the colourlessness of a supratemporal model. \nOnly by historicality which is factical and authentic can the history of \nwhat has-been-there, as a resolute fate, be disclosed in such a manner that \nin repetition the 'force' of the possible gets struck home into one's factical \nexistence-in other words, that it comes towards that existence in its \nfutural character. The historicality of unhistoriological Dasein does not \ntake its departure from the 'Present' and from what is 'actual' only today, \nin order to grope its way back from there to something that is past; and \nneither does historiology. Even historiological disclosure temporalizes itself \nin terms of the future. The 'selection' of what is to become a possible \nobject for historiology has already been met with in the factical existentiell \nchoice of Dasein's historicality, in which historiology first of all arises, and \nin which alone it is. \nThe historiological disclosure of the 'past' is based on fateful repetition, \nand is so far from 'subjective' that it alone guarantees the 'Objectivity' \nof historiology. For the Objectivity of a science is regulated primarily in \nterms of whether that science can confront us with the entity which \nbelongs to it as its theme, and can bring it, uncovered in the primordiality \nof its Being, to our understanding. In no science are the 'universal validity' \nof standards and the claims to 'universality' which the \"they\" and its \ncommon sense demand, less possible as criteria of 'truth' than in authentic \nhistoriology. \nOnly because in each case the central theme of historiology is the \npossibility of existence which has-been-there, and because the latter exists \nfactically in a way which is world-historical, can it demand of itself that \nit takes its orientation inexorably from the 'facts'.

But in so far as this \"today\" \nhas been interpreted in terms of understanding a possibility of existence \nwhich has been seized upon-an understanding which is repetitive in \na futural manner-authentic historiology becomes a way in which the \n\"today\" gets deprived of its character as present ; in other words, it \nbecomes a way of painfully detaching oneself from the falling publicness \nof the 'today\". As authentic, the historiology which is both monumental \nand antiquarian is necessarily a critique of the 'Present'.

But the 'substance' eludes it, and it \ncovers up more than it reveals. \nWe may divide Dilthey's researches schematically into three domains: \nstudies on the theory of the humane sciences, and the distinction between \nthese and the natural sciences; researches into the history of the sciences of \nman, society, and the state; endeavours towards a psychology in which the \n'whole fact of man' is to be presented.

Our chapter will be divided as follows: \nDasein's temporality, and our concern with time (Section 79) ;  the time \nwith which we concern ourselves, and within-time-ness (Section 8o) ; \nwithin-time-ness and the genesis of the ordinary conception of time \n(Section 81) ; a comparison of the existential-ontological connection of \ntemporality, Dasein, and world-time, with Hegel's way of taking the \nrelation between time and spirit (Section 82) ; the existential-temporal \nanalytic of Dasein and the question of fundamental ontology as to the \nmeaning of Being in general (Section 83). \n\u009b 79\u00b7 Dasein's Temporality, and our Concern with Time \nDasein exists as an entity for which, in its Being, that Being is itself \nan issue. Essentially ahead of itself, it has projected itself upon its \npotentiality-for-Being before going on to any mere consideration of \nitself. In its projection it reveals itself as something which has been \nthrown. It has been thrownly abandoned to the 'world', and falls into \nit concernfully.1 As care-that is, as existing in the unity of the pro\u00ad\njection which has been fallingly thrown-this entity has been disclosed \nas a \"there\". As being with Others, it maintains itself in an average way \nof interpreting-a way which has been Articulated in discourse and \nexpressed in language. Being-in-the-world has always expressed itself, and \nas Being alongside entities encountered within-the-world, it constantly \nexpresses itself in addressing itself to the very object of its concern and \ndiscussing it, The concern of circumspective common sense is grounded \nin temporality-indeed in the mode of a making-present which retains \nand awaits. Such concern, as concernfully reckoning up, planning, \npreventing, or taking precautions, always says (whether audibly or not) \nthat something is to happen 'then', that something else is to be attended to \n'beforehand', that what has failed or eluded us 'on that former occasion' is \nsomething that we must 'now' make up for. 2 \nIn the 'then', concern expresses itself as awaiting; in the 'on that former \noccasion', as retaining; in the 'now', as making present.

We avail ourselves of it 'at any time' without \nhaving taken it over explicitly, and we constantly make use of it even \nthough we do not always make utterances about it. Even in the most \ntrivial, offhand kind of everyday talk ('It's cold', for instance) we also \nhave in mind a 'now that . .  .'. Why is it that when Dasein addresses \nitself to the objects of its concern, it also expresses a 'now that . .  .', a \n'then, when \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n ', or an 'on that former occasion, when . . .  \n', even though \nit does so mostly without uttering it ? First, because in addressing itself to \nsomething interpretatively, it expresses itself too; that is to say, it expresses \n408 \nits Being alongside the ready-to-band-a Being which understands circum\u00ad\nspectively and which uncovers the ready-to-hand and lets it be en\u00ad\ncountered. And secondly, because this very addressing and discussing\u00ad\nwhich interprets itself also-is based upon a making-present and is possible \nonly as such.t \nThe making-present which awaits and retains, interprets itself. And this \nin turn is possible only because, as something which in itself is ecstatically \nopen, it has in each case been disclosed to itself already and can be \nArticulated in the kind of interpretation which is accompanied by under\u00ad\nstanding and discourse. Because temporality is ecstatico-horizonally constitutive \nfor the clearedness of the \"there\", temporality is always primordially interpretable \nin the \"there\" and is accordingly familiar to us. The making-present which \ninterprets itself-in other words, that which has been interpreted and is \naddressed in the 'now'-is what we call 'time'. This simply makes known \nto us that temporality-which, as ecstatically open, is recognizable-is \nfamiliar, proximally and for the most part, only as interpreted in this \nconcernful manner.1 But while time is 'immediately' intelligible and \nrecognizable, this does not preclude the possibility that primordial \ntemporality as such may remain unknown and unconceived, and that this \nis also the case with the source of the time which has been expressed-a \nsource which temporalizes itself in that temporality. \nThe fact that the structure of datability belongs essentially to what has \nbeen interpreted with the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former \noccasion', becomes the most elemental proof that what has thus been \ninterpreted has originated in the temporality which interprets itself. \nWhen we say 'now', we always understand a 'now that so and \n1 'Das sich auslegende Gegenwiirtigen, das heisst das im \"jetzt\" angesprochene Aus\u00ad\ngelegte nennen wir \"Zeit\". Darin bekundet sich lediglich, dass die Zeitlichkeit, als \nekstatisch offene kenntlich, zunachst und zumeist nur in dieser besorgenden Ausgelegtheit \nbekannt ist.' The older editions have 'ausgesprochenc' ('expressed') rather than 'anges\u00ad\nprochene' ('addresed') ; the comma after 'Zeitlichkeit' is missing, and the particle \u030fa' \nappears just before 'zunachst'. \n"

' lies the ecstatical character \nof the Present. The datability of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that \nformer occasion', reflects the ecstatical constitution of temporality, and is \ntherefore essential for the time itself that has been expressed. The structure \nof the datability of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former occasion', \nis evidence that these, stemming from temporality, are themselves time. The \ninterpretative expressing of the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that former \noccasion', is the most primordial way of assigning a time. 2 In the ecstatical \nunity of temporality-which gets understood along with datability, but \nunthematically and without being recognizable as such-Dasein has \nalready been disclosed to itself as Being-in-the-world, and entities within\u00ad\nthe-world have been discovered along with it; because of this, interpreted \ntime has already been given a dating in terms of those entities which are \nencountered in the disclosedness of the \"there\" : \"now that-the door \nslams\" ; \"now that-my book is missing\", and so forth. 3 \nThe horizons which belong to the 'now', the 'then', and the 'on that \nformer occasion', all have their source of ecstatical temporality; by reason \nof this, these horizons too have the character of datability as 'today, \n409 \nwhen . .  .', 'later on, when . . .  ', and 'earlier, when . .  .'' \nIf awaiting understands itself in the 'then' and interprets itself, and \nthereby, as making present, understands that which it awaits, and under\u00ad\nstands this in terms of its 'now', then the 'and-now-not-yet' is already \nimplied when we 'assign' a 'then'. The awaiting which makes present \nunderstands the 'until-then'. This 'until-then' is Articulated by inter\u00ad\npretation : it 'has its time' as the \"in-between\", which likewise has a relation\u00ad\nship of datability. This relationship gets expressed in the 'during-this' or \n'meanwhile' [\"wahrend dessen . .  .'']. The 'during' can itself be Articulated \nawaitingly by concern, by assigning some more 'thens'. The 'until\u00ad\nthen' gets divided up by a number of 'from-then-till-thens', which, how\u00ad\never, have been 'embraced' beforehand in awaitingly projecting the \nprimary 'then'. 'Enduring' gets Articulated in the understanding one has \n1 '  \"Jetzt\"-sagend verstehen wir iinmer auch schon, ohne es mitzusagen, ein \"-da \ndas und das . . .

The earlier editions \nhave 'sie' instead of 'diese'. (While we have generally tried to reserve the verb 'assign' for \nverbs such as 'verweisen' and 'zuweisen', it is convenient to use it in this chapter to \ntranslate such expressions as 'angeben', 'Angabe', and 'Zeitangabe'.) \n8 ' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  jetzt, da--die Tiir schlagt; jetzt, da-mir das Buch fehlt, und dergleichen.' While \nthe phrase 'jetzt' da . .  .' ordinarily means 'now that . .  .', Heidegger here seems to be \ninterpreting it with an illusion to the 'da' which we have usually translated as 'there'\u00ad\nthe 'da' of 'Dasein'. \n4.

The making-present which awaits \nand retains, lays 'out' a 'during' with a span, only because it has thereby \ndisclosed itself as the way in which its historical temporality has been \necstatically stretched along, even though it does not know itself as this. 2 But \nhere a further peculiarity of the time which has been 'assigned' shows \nitself. Not only does the 'during' have a span ; but every 'now', 'then', and \n'on that former occasion' has, with its datability-structure, its own \nspanned character, with the width of the span varying : 'now'-in the \nintermission, while one is eating, in the evening, in summer ; 'then'-at \nbreakfast, when one is taking a climb, and so forth. \nThe concern which awaits, retains, and makes present, is one which \n'allows itself' so much time ; and it assigns itself this time concernfully, even \nwithout determining the time by any specific reckoning, and before any \nsuch reckoning has been done. Here time dates itself in one's current mode \nof allowing oneself time concernfully; and it does so in terms of those very \nmatters with which one concerns oneself environmentally, and which have \nbeen disclosed in the understanding with its accompanying state-of-mind \n-in terms of what one does 'all day long'. The more Dasein is awaitingly \nabsorbed in the object of its concern and forgets itself in not awaiting \nitself, the more does even the time which it 'allows' itself remain covered up \nby this way of 'allowing'. When Dasein is 'living along' in an everyday \nconcernful manner, it just never understands itself as running along in a \nContinuously enduring sequence of pure 'nows'. By reason of this covering \nup, the time which Dasein allows itself has gaps in it, as it were. Often \nwe do not bring a 'day' together again when we come back to the time \n41 0  \nwhich we have 'used'. But the time which has gaps in it does not go to \npieces in this lack-of-togetherness, which is rather a mode of that \ntemporality which has already been disclosed and stretched along ecstatically. \nThe manner in which the time we have 'allowed' 'runs its course', and the \nway in which concern more or less explicitly assigns itself that time, can \nbe properly explained as phenomena only if, on the one hand, we avoid \nl 'Mit dem gewiirtigend-gegenwiirtigenden Verstehen des \"wiihrend\" wird das \n\"Wiihren\" artikuliert.' 'Wiihren' of course means 'enduring' in the sense of lasting or \ncontinuing, not in that of 'suffering' or 'tolerating'. \n2 'Das gewiirtigend-behaltende Gegenwiirtigen legt nur deshalb ein gespanntes \n\"wiihrend\" \"aus\", wei! es dabei sich als die ekstatische Erstrecktheit der geschichtlichen \nZeitlichkeit, wenngleich als solche unerkannt, erschlossen ist.' Our translation of 'ges\u00ad\npanntes' as 'with a span' preserves the connection with 'Spanne' but misses the connotation \nof 'tenseness', which Heidegger clearly has in mind elsewhere (e.g. H. 261 f., 374) and is \nsurely suggesting here. The pun on 'auslegen' ('interpret') and 'legt . . .  \"aus\" ' ('lays \n\"out\" ') also disappears in translation. \n"

According to that characteriza\u00ad\ntion, the irresoluteness of inauthentic existence temporalizes itself in the \nmode of a making-present which does not await but forgets. He who is \nirresolute understands himself in terms of those very closest events and \nbe-failings which he encounters in such a making-present and which \nthrust themselves upon him in varying ways. Busily losing himself in the \nobject of his concern, he loses his time in it too. Hence his characteristic way \nof talking-'! have no time'. But just as he who exists inauthentically is \nconstantly losing time and never 'has' any, the temporality of authentic \nexistence remains distinctive in that such existence, in its resoluteness, \nnever loses time and 'always has time'. For the temporality of resoluteness \nhas, with relation to its Present, the character of a moment of vision. When \nsuch a moment makes the Situation authentically present, this making\u00ad\npresent does not itself take the lead, but is held in that future which is in \nthe process of having-been.

But resoluteness discloses the \"there\" in \nthis way only as a Situation. So if he who is resolute encounters anything \nthat has been disclosed, he can never do so in such a way as to lose his \ntime on it irresolutely. \nThe ''there'' is disclosed in a way which is grounded in Dasein's own temporality \nas ecstatically stretched along, and with this disclosure a 'time' is allotted to Dasein; \nonly because of this can Dasein, as factically thrown, 'take' its time and lose it. \nAs something disclosed, Dasein exists factically in the way of Being with \nOthers. It maintains itself in an intelligibility which is public and average. \nWhen the 'now that . . .  ' and the 'then when . . .  ' have been interpreted \nand expressed in our everyday Being with one another, they will be under-\nstood in principle, even though their dating is unequivocal only within \n41 1 \ncertain limits. In the 'most intimate' Being-with-one-another of several \npeople, they can say 'now' and say it 'together', though each of them gives \na different date to the 'now' which he is saying : \"now that this or that \nhas come to pass \u2022\n.\n.\n \" The 'now' which anyone expresses is always said \nin the publicness of Being-in-the-world with one another.

The Time with which we Concern Ourselves, and Within-time-ness \nSo far we have only had to understand provisionally how Dasein, as \ngrounded in temporality, is, in its very existing, concerned with times \nand how, in such interpretative concern, time makes itself public for \nBeing-in-the-world. But the sense in which time 'is' if it is of the kind \nwhich is public and has been expressed, remains completely undefined, \nif indeed such time can be considered as being at all. Before we can make \nany decision as to whether public time is 'merely subjective' or 'Objec\u00ad\ntively actual', or neither of these, its phenomenal character must first \nbe determined more precisely. \nWhen time is made public, this does not happen just occasionally and \nsubsequently. On the contrary, because Dasein, as something ecstatico\u00ad\ntemporal, is already disclosed, and because understanding and interpreta\u00ad\ntion both belong to existence, time has already made itself public in \nconcern. One directs oneself according to it, so that it must somehow be the \nsort of thing which Everyman can come across. \nAlthough one can concern oneself with time in the manner which we \nhave characterized-namely, by dating in terms of environmental events \n-this always happens basically within the horizon of that kind of concern \nwith time which we know as astronomical and calendrical time-reckoning. \nSuch reckoning does not occur by accident, but has its existential-onto\u00ad\nlogical necessity in the basic state of Dasein as care. Because it is essential \nto Dasein that it exists fallingly as something thrown, it interprets its \ntime concernfully by way of time-reckoning. In this, the 'real' making-\n\u2022P 2 \npublic of time gets temporalized, so that we must say that Dasein's thrownness \nis the reason why 'there is' time publicly.1 If we are to demonstrate that public \ntime has its source in factical temporality, and if we are to assure ourselves \nthat this demonstration is as intelligible as possible, the time which has \nbeen interpreted in the temporality of concern must first be characterized, \nI 'In ihr zeitigt sich die \"eigentliche\" Veroffentlichung der Zeit, sodas gesagt werden \nmus : die Geworfenheit des Daseins ist der Grund dafiir, dass es Ojfentlich Zeit \"gibt\".' Heidegger's \nquotation marks around 'gibt' suggest an intentional pun which would permit the alter\u00ad\nnative translation: ' . . .  the reason why Dasein \"gives\" time publicly.' \n"

This \nrequires that these entities which are not of the character of Dasein, shall \nbe called entities \"within-time\". The Interpretation of within-time-ness \ngives us a more primordial insight into the essence of 'public time' and \nlikewise makes it possible to define its 'Being'. \nThe Being of Dasein is care. This entity exists fallingly as something \nthat has been thrown.

Thus Dasein dates \nthe time which it must take, and dates it in terms of something it encounters \nwithin the world and within the horizon of its abandonment to the world \n-in terms of something encountered as having a distinctive involve\u00ad\nment for its circumspective potentiality-for-Being-in-the-world. Concern \nmakes use of the 'Being-ready-to-hand' of the sun, which sheds forth light \nand warmth.

Dasein \nhistorizesfrom day to day by reason of its way of interpreting time by dating \nit-a way which is adumbrated in its thrownness into the \"there\". \nThis dating of things in terms of the heavenly body which sheds forth \nlight and warmth, and in terms of its distinctive 'places' in the sky, is a \nway of assigning time which can be done in our Being with one another \n'under the same sky', and which can be done for 'Everyman' at any time \nin the same way, so that within certain limits everyone is proximally agreed \nupon it. That by which things are thus dated is available environmentally \nand yet not restricted to the world of equipment with which one currently \nconcerns oneself. It is rather the case that in the world the environing \nNature and the public environment are always discovered along with it.fi \nThis public dating, in which everyone assigns himself his time, is one which \neveryone can 'reckon' on simultaneously; it uses a publicly available \nmeasure. This dating reckons with time in the sense of a measuring of time; \nand such measuring requires something by which time is to be measured \n-namely, a clock. This implies that along with the temporality of Dasein as \nthrown, abandoned to the 'world', and giving itself time, something like a 'clock' \nis also discovered-that is, something ready-to-hand which in its regular recurrence \nhas become accessible in one's making present awaitingry. The Being which has \nbeen thrown and is alongside the ready-to-hand is grounded in temporality. \nTemporality is the reason for the clock. As the condition for the pos\u00ad\nsibility that a clock is factically necessary, temporality is likewise the \ncondition for its discoverability. For while the course of the sun is encoun\u00ad\ntered along with the discoveredness of entities within-the-world, it is only \nby making it present in awaitingly retaining, and by doing so in a way \nwhich interprets itself, that dating in terms of what is ready-to-hand \nenvironmentally in a public way is made possible and is also required. \nDasein has its basis in temporality, and the 'natural' clock which has \nalready been discovered along with Dasein's factical thrownness furnishes \n414 \nthe first motivation for the production and use of clocks which will be \nsomewhat more handy ; it also makes this possible. Indeed it does this in \nsuch a manner that these 'artificial' clocks must be 'adjusted' to that \n"

If the time with which we concern ourselves is 'really' \nmade public only when it gets measured, then if public time is to be acces\u00ad\nsible in a way which has been phenomenally unveiled, we must have access \nto it by following up the way in which that which has been dated shows \nitself when dated in this 'reckoning' manner. \nWhen the 'then' which interprets itself in concernful awaiting gets dated, \nthis dating includes some such statement as \"then-when it dawns-it is \ntime for one's daily work\". The time which is interpreted in concern is \nalready understood as a time for something. The current 'now that so \nand so . .  .' is as such either appropriate or inappropriate. Not only is the 'now' \n(and so too any mode of interpreted time) a 'now that \n. .  .' which is \nessentially datable ; but as such it has essentially, at the same time, the \nstructure of appropriateness or inappropriateness. Time which has been \ninterpreted has by its very nature the character of 'the time for something' \nor 'the wrong time for something' .1 When concern makes present by \nawaiting and retaining, time is understood in relation to a \"for-which\" ;2 \nand this in turn is ultimately tied up with a \"for-the-sake-of-which\" of \nDasein's potentiality-for-Being. With this \"in-order-to\" relation, the time \nwhich has been made public makes manifest that structure with which \nwe have earlierlll become acquainted as significance, and which constitutes \nthe worldhood of the world. As 'the time for something', the time which has \nbeen made public has essentially a world-character. Hence the time which \nmakes itself public in the temporalizing of temporality is what we desig\u00ad\nnate as \"world-time\". And we designate it thus not because it is present\u00ad\nat-hand as an entity within-the-world (which it can never be), but because it \nbelongs to the world [zur Welt] in the sense which we have Interpreted \nexistential-ontologically. In the following pages we must show how the \nessential relations of the world-structure (the 'in-order-to', for example) 'are \nconnected with public time (the 'then, when . .  .', for example) by reason \nof the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of temporality. Only now, in any \ncase, can the time with which we concern ourselves be completely char\u00ad\nacterized as to its structure : it is datable, spanned, and public ; and as \nhaving this structure, it belongs to the world itself.

As time-reckoning is perfected and the use \nof clocks becomes more refined, this making-public gets enhanced and \nstrengthened. We shall not give here a historiological presentation of the \nhistorical evolution of time-reckoning and the use of clocks, with all its \npossible variations. We must rather ask in an existential-ontological way \nwhat mode of the temporalizing ofDasein's temporality becomes manifest \nin the direction which the development of time-reckoning and clock-using \nhas taken. When this question is answered, there must arise a more prim\u00ad\nordial understanding of the fact that the measurement of time-and this \nmeans also the explicit making-public of time as an object of concern-is \ngrounded in the temporality of Dasein, and indeed in a quite definite tem\u00ad\nporalizing of that temporality. \nComparison shows that for the 'advanced' Dasein the day and the \npresence of sunlight no longer have such a special function as they have \nfor the 'primitive' Dasein on which our analysis of 'natural' time-reckon\u00ad\ning has been based ; for the 'advanced' Dasein has the 'advantage' of \neven being able to turn night into day. Similarly we no longer need to \nglance explicitly and immediately at the sun and its position to ascertain \nthe time. The manufacture and use of measuring-equipment of one's \nown permits one to read off the time directly by a clock produced espec\u00ad\nially for this purpose. The \"what o'clock is it?\" is the 'what time is it ?' \nBecause the clock-in the sense of that which makes possible a public way \nof time-reckoning-must be regulated by the 'natural' clock, even the \nuse of clocks as equipment is based upon Dasein's temporality, which, \nwith the disclosedness of the \"there\", first makes possible a dating of the \ntime with which we concern ourselves; this is a fact, even if it is covered \nup when the time is read off. Our understanding of the natural clock \ndevelops with the advancing discovery of Nature, and instructs us as to new \npossibilities fora kind of time-measurement which is relatively independent \nof the day and of any explicit observation of the sky. \nBut in a certain manner even 'primitive' Dasein makes itself in\u00ad\ndependent of reading off the time directly from the sky, when instead of \nascertaining the sun's position it measures the shadow cast by some entity \n41 6  \navailable at any time.

Measuring time is essentially such that it is \nnecessary to say \"now\" ; but in obtaining the measurement, we, as it \nwere, forget what has been measured as such, so that nothing is to be \nfound except a number and a stretch. \nWhen Dasein concerns itself with time, then the less time it has to lose, \nthe more 'precious' does that time become, and the handier the clock must \nbe. Not only should we be able to assign the time 'more precisely', but the \nvery determining of the time should claim as little time as possible, though \nit must still agree with the ways in which Others assign time. \nProvisionally it was enough for us to point out the general 'connection' \nof the use of clocks with that temporality which takes its time. Just as the \nconcrete analysis of astronomical time-reckoning in its full development \nbelongs to the existential-ontological Interpretation of how Nature is \ndiscovered, the foundations ofhistoriological and calendrical 'chronology' \ncan be laid bare only within the orbit of the tasks of analysing historio\u00ad\nlogical cognition existentially.v \nThe measurement of time gives it a marked public character, so that \n419 \nonly in this way does what we generally call 'the time' become well known. \nIn concern every Thing has 'its time' attributed to it. It 'has' it, and, like \nevery entity within-the-world, it can 'have' it only because after all it is \n'in time'. That time 'wherein' entities within-the-world are encountered, \nwe know as \"world-time\". By reason of the ecstatico-horizonal con\u00ad\nstitution of the temporality which belongs to it, this has the same \ntranscendence as the world itself. With the disclosedness of the world, \nworld-time has been made public, so that every temporally concernfulBeing \nalongside entities within-the-world understands these entities circumspec-\ntively as encountered 'in time'. \nThe time 'in which' the present-at-hand is in motion or at rest is \nnot 'Objective', if what we mean by that is the Being-present-at-hand-in\u00ad\nitself of entities encountered within-the-world. But just as little is time \n'subjective', if by this we understand Being-present-at-hand and occur\u00ad\nring in a 'subject'. World-time is 'more Objective' than any possible Object \nbecause, with the disclosedness of the world, it already becomes 'Objectified' in an \necstatico-horizonal manner as the condition for the possibility of entities within-the\u00ad\nWorld. Thus, contrary to Kant's opinion, one comes across world-time \njust as immediately in the physical as in the psychical, and not just \nroundabout by way of the psychical. 'Time' first shows itself in the \nsky-precisely where one comes across it when one regulates oneself \n"

Although it is not said explicitly \nthat the \"nows\" are present-at-hand in the same way as Things, they still \nget 'seen' ontologically within the horizon of the idea of presence-at-hand. \nThe \"nows\" pass away, and those which have passed away make up the \npast.

In every \"now\" the \"now\" is now \nand therefore it constantly has presence as something selfsame, even though \nin every \"now\" another may be vanishing as it comes along.11 Yet as this \nthing which changes, it simultaneously shows its own constant presence. \nThus even Plato, who directed his glance in this manner at time as a \nsequence of \"nows\" arising and passing away, had to call time \"the \nimage of eternity\" : \u00a3lKw 8' l7T\u00a3von KW1JTOV T\u00a3va alwvos 7Totfjaat, Kai \n8taKoap.Wv ttp.a ovpaVOV 7TO\u00a3\u00a3\u00f2 p.JvoVTOS alclJvos Jv Jv/.

This orientation by Dasein's temporality \nindeed makes it possible to exhibit the origin and the factical necessity of \nthis levelling off and covering up, and at the same time to test the argu\u00ad\nments for the ordinary theses about time. \nOn the other hand, within the horizon of the way time is ordinarily \nunderstood, temporality is inaccessible in the reverse direction.1 Not only must \nthe now-time be oriented primarily by temporality in the order of possible \ninterpretation, but it temporalizes itself only in the inauthentic tempor\u00ad\nality of Dasein ; so if one has regard for the way the now-time is derived \nfrom temporality, one is justified in considering temporality as the time \nwhich is primordial. \nEcstatico-horizonal temporality temporalizes itself primarily in terms of \nthe future. In the way time is ordinarily understood, however, the basic \nphenomenon of time is seen in the \"now\", and indeed in that pure \"now\" \nwhich has been shorn in its full structure-that which they call the 'Pre-\n427 \nsent'.

Correspondingly, the future as ecstatically under\u00ad\nstood-the datable and significant 'then'-does not coincide with the \nordinary conception of the 'future' in the sense of a pure \"now\" which \nhas not yet come along but is only coming along. And the concept of the \npast in the sense of the pure \"now\" which has passed away, is just \nas far from coinciding with the ecstatical \"having-been\"-the datable \nand significant 'on a former occasion'. The \"now\" is not pregnant with \nthe \"not-yet-now\", but the Present arises from the future in the prim-\nordial ecstatical unity of the temporalizing of temporality.xili \nAlthough, proximally and for the most part, the ordinary experience of \ntime is one that knows only 'world-time', it always gives it a distinctive \nrelationship to 'soul' and 'spirit', even if this is still a far cry from a \nphilosophical inquiry oriented explicitly and primarily towards the \n'subject'. As evidence for this, two characteristic passages will suffice. \nAristotle says : \u00a3l 8\u20ac p:ry8\u20acv aAAO 1TlcpvK\u00a3V ci.pdJp.\u00a3'iV P ,PvxQ Ka\u00ef .fvxfjs voiJs, \nci.MvaTOV \u00a3lva\u00a3 xpovov .fvxfjs f-LQ OVUTJS\u00b7 \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n XIV And Saint Augustine writes : \n1 'Dagegen bleibt umgekehrt die Zeitlichkeit im Horizont des vulgiiren Zeitverstand\u00ad\nnisses un;;ugiinglich.' \n"

And Hegelhasmadean explicit attempt to set forth the way \nin which time as ordinarily understood is connected with spirit. In Kant, \non the other hand, while time is indeed 'subjective', it stands 'beside' \n428 \nthe 'I think' and is not bound up with it.xvt The grounds which Hegel has \nexplicitly provided for the connection between time and spirit are well \nsuited to elucidate indirectly the foregoing Interpretation of Dasein as \ntemporality and our exhibition of temporality as the source of world\u00ad\ntime. \n\u0101 82. A Comparison of the Existential-ontological Connection of Temporality, \nDasein, and World-time, with Hegel's Way of Taking the Relation between Time \nand Spirit \nHistory, which is essentially the history of spirit, runs its course 'in \ntime'. Thus 'the development of history falls into time' .xvii l Hegel is not \nsatisfied, however, with averring that the within-time-ness of spirit is a \nFact, but seeks to understand how it is possible for spirit to fall into time, \nwhich is 'the non-sensuous sensuous'.xvtu Time must be able, as it were, \nto take in spirit. And spirit in turn must be akin to time and its essence. \nAccordingly two points come up for discussion : (r) how does Hegel define \nthe essence of time ? ( 2) what belongs to the essence of spirit which makes \nit possible for it to 'fall into time' ? Our answer to these questions will serve \nmerely to elucidate our Interpretation of Dasein as temporality, and to do \nso by way of a comparison. We shall make no claim to give even a relatively \nfull treatment of the allied problems in Hegel, especially since 'criticizing' \nhim will not help us. Because Hegel's conception of time presents the most \nradical way in which the ordinary understanding of time has been given \nform conceptually, and one which has received too little attention, \na comparison of this conception with the idea of temporality which we \nhave expounded is one that especially suggests itself. \n(a) Hegel's Conception of Time \nWhen a philosophical Interpretation of time is carried out, it gets a \n'locus in a system' ; this locus may be considered as criteria! for the basic \nway of treating time by which such an Interpretation is guided. In the \n1 'Also fallt die Entwicklung der Geschichte in die Zeit\".' Throughout this section it \nwill be convenient to translate Hegel's verb 'fallen' by 'fall', though elsewhere we have \nlargely pre-empted this for Heidegger's 'verfallen'. 'Verfallen' does not appear until H. \n436, where we shall call attention to it explicitly. (In this quotation, as in several others, \nHeidegger has taken a few minor liberties with Hegel's text, which are too trivial for any \nspecial comment.) \n"

      "full_text": "II. 6 \nBeing and Time \n'physics' of Aristotle-that is, in the context of an ontology of Nature\u00ad\nthe ordinary way of understanding time has received its first thematically \ndetailed traditional interpretation. 'Time', 'location', and 'movement' \nstand together. True to tradition, Hegel's analysis of time has its locus \n429 \nin the second part of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, which is \nentitled 'Philosophy ofNature'. The first portion of this treats of mechanics, \nand of this the first division is devoted to the discussion of 'space and time'. \nHe calls these 'the abstract \"outside-of-one-another\" \u2022.xtx \nThough Hegel puts space and time together, this does not happen \nsimply because he has arranged them superficially one after the other: \nspace, 'and time also'. 'Philosophy combats such an \"also\".' The transition \nfrom space to time does not signify that these are treated in adjoining \nparagraphs ; rather 'it is space itself that makes the transition'.1 Space 'is' \ntime ; that is, time is the 'truth' of space.xx If space is thought dialectically \nin that which it is, then according to Hegel this Being of space unveils itself \nas time. How must space be thought ? \nSpace is 'the unmediated indifference of Nature's Being-outside-of\u00ad\nitself'.xxi This is a way of saying that space is the abstract multiplicity \n[Vielheit] of the points which are differentiable in it.2 Space is not \ninterrupted by these; but neither does it arise from them by way of \njoining them together. Though it is differentiated by differentiable points \nwhich are space themselves, space remains, for its part, without any \ndifferences. The differences themselves are of the same character as that \nwhich they differentiate. Nevertheless, the point, in so far as it differen-\ntiates anything ir:t space, is the negation of space, though in such a manner \nthat, as this negation, it itself remains in space ; a point is space after all. \nThe point does not lift itself out of space as if it were something of another \ncharacter. Space is the \"outside-of-one-another\" of the multiplicity of \npoints [Punktmannigfaltigkeit] , and it is without any differences. But it \nis not as if space were a point ; space is rather, as Hegel says, 'punctuality' \n[\"Punktualitat\"] . xxu This is the basis for the sentence in which Hegel \nthinks of space in its truth-that is, as time : 'Negativity, which relates \nitself as point to space, and which develops in space its determinations as \nline and surface, is, however, just as muchfor itself in the sphere of Being\u00ad\noutside-of-itself, and so are its determinations therein, though while it is \n430 \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n.\n sondern \"der Raum selbst geht uber\".' \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 in ihm unterscheidbaren Punkte.' We have often translated 'unterscheiden' as \n'distinguish' or 'discriminate', and 'Unterschied' as 'distinction' or 'difference', leaving \n'differentiate' and 'differentiation' for such words as 'differenzieren' and 'Differenz', etc. \nIn this discussion of Hegel, however, it will be convenient to translate 'unterscheiden' as \n'differentiate', 'Unterschied' as 'difference', 'unterscheidbar' as 'differentiable', 'unter\u00ad\nschiedslos' as 'without differences'. (We shall continue to translate 'gleichgilltig as 'in\u00ad\ndifferent'.) \n"
