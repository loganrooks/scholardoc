In the \nopinion of petty-bourgeois politicians, order means precisely the \nreconciliation of classes and not the oppression of one class by \nanother; to moderate the conflict means to reconcile classes and \nnot to deprive the oppressed classes of definite means and methods \nof struggle for the overthrow of their oppressors.\nFor instance: when, in the Revolution of 1917, the question \narose in all its magnitude about the significance and role of the \nstate as a practical question demanding immediate action on a \nmass scale, all the SRs (Socialist Revolutionaries) and Mensheviks \nimmediately and completely bowed down before the petty- \nbourgeois theory of the \u2018reconciliation\u2019 of classes by \u2018the state\u2019. \nInnumerable resolutions and articles by politicians of both these \nparties are thoroughly pervaded by this petty-bourgeois and philis\u00ad\ntine theory.

Let us take for example the very first \nmonths of the Russian democratic republic, one might call it the \nhoneymoon after the \u2018socialist\u2019 SRs and Mensheviks were joined in \nwedlock to the bourgeoisie in a coalition government. If Mr Palchin- \nski obstructed every measure intended to curb the capitalists and \ntheir marauding practices, their pillaging of the treasury by means \nof war contracts; and if later on Mr Palchinski resigned from the \nministry only to be replaced, of course, by another Palchinski of \nexactly the same type, and if the capitalists \u2018rewarded\u2019 him with a \nnice little job at a salary of 120,000 roubles per annum: what would \nyou call this?

A democratic republic is the best possible political \nshell for capitalism, and therefore, once capital has got control of \nthis excellent shell (through the Palchinskis, Chernovs, Tseretelis \nand Co.), it establishes its power so securely, so firmly, that no \nchange of individuals, of institutions or of parties in the bourgeois- \ndemocratic republic can shake this power.\nIt is also necessary to note that Engels is most definite in naming \neven universal suffrage as an instrument of bourgeois rule. Univer\u00ad\nsal suffrage, he says, obviously considering the long experience of \nGerman social-democracy, is\nthe gauge of the maturity of the working class. It neither can nor will give \nany more in the present-day state.\nM\n"

This letter contains, amongst other things, the \nfollowing remarkable comment.\nAs regards myself, I am due no credit for discovering the existence of \nclasses in modern society or for discovering the struggle amongst them. \nBourgeois historians long before me described the historical development \nof this struggle of the classes, and bourgeois economists the economic \nanatomy of the classes. What I did that was new was to prove the following: \n(1) that the existence of classes is bound up only with definite historical \nphases in the development of production (historiche Entwicklungsphasen \nder Produktion); (2) that class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship \nof the proletariat; (3) that this dictatorship itself constitutes only the tran\u00ad\nsition to the eradication of all classes and to a society without classes . ..\nWith these words Marx succeeded in giving stunningly vivid \nexpression firstly to the main and radical difference between his \ndoctrine and the doctrine of the advanced and most profound \nthinkers of the bourgeoisie; and secondly to the essence of his \ndoctrine on the state.\nThe main point in Marx\u2019s teachings is the class struggle. This is \nvery often said and written. But it is not true. And it is from this \nuntruth that there very often results an opportunist distortion of \nMarxism, its falsification in such a way as to make it acceptable to \nthe bourgeoisie. For the doctrine of the class struggle was created \nnot by Marx but by the bourgeoisie before Marx; and generally \nspeaking it is acceptable to the bourgeoisie. Those who recognize \nonly the class struggle are not yet Marxists; they may be situated \nstill within the framework of bourgeois thinking and bourgeois \npolitics. To limit Marxism to the doctrine of the class struggle \nmeans to chop up Marxism, distort and reduce it to something \nacceptable to the bourgeoisie. Only those persons are Marxists who \nextend the recognition of class struggle as far as the recognition of \nthe dictatorship of the proletariat.

Firstly, he limits his conclusion to the continent. \nThis was understandable in 1871, when England was still the model \nof a purely capitalist country and was without militarism and, to a \nconsiderable degree, without bureaucratism. Marx consequently \nmade an exception of England, where a revolution, even a people\u2019s \nrevolution, then seemed to be and indeed was possible without \nthe preliminary condition of destroying the \u2018ready-made state \nmachine\u2019.\nNow in 1917, in the epoch of the first great imperialist war, this \nreservation by Marx is no longer valid. Both England and America, \nthe largest and ultimate representatives - in the whole world - of \nAnglo-Saxon \u2018liberty\u2019 in the sense of an absence of militarism and \nbureaucratism, have completely sunk into the all-European filthy \nand bloody morass of bureaucratic-military institutions which \nsubordinate everything to themselves and trample everything \nunderfoot.

And as soon as it is the majority of \nthe people itself which suppresses its oppressors, a \u2018special force\u2019 \nfor suppression is no longer necessary! In this sense the state begins \nto wither away. Instead of the special institutions of a privileged \nminority (privileged officialdom, the high command of the standing \narmy), the majority itself can directly undertake this, and the more \nthe functions of state power are undertaken by the people as a \nwhole, the less need is left for such a power.\nIn this respect a certain measure of the Commune highlighted by \nMarx is especially noteworthy: the abolition of all financial allow\u00ad\nances for persons chosen as political representatives and of all \nfinancial privileges accorded to officials: the reduction of the pay \nfor all servants of the state to the level of \u2018a workman\u2019s wages\u2019.

This naturally can be realized only by the \nexpropriation of the present owners and by the transferring of their houses \nto homeless workers or to workers presently living in excessively over\u00ad\ncrowded apartments. As soon as the proletariat conquers political power, \nsuch a measure dictated in the interest of the public good will be just as \neasy to carry out as are other expropriations and billetings by the existing \nstate.\n(p. 22, German edition, 1887)\nThe change in the form of state power is not examined here: only \nthe content of its activity is taken up. Expropriations and occupa\u00ad\ntions of apartments take place even on the orders of the existing \nstate. From the formal point of view the proletarian state will also \n\u2018order\u2019 the occupation of apartments and expropriation of build\u00ad\nings. But it is clear that the old executive apparatus, the bureau\u00ad\ncracy, which is linked to the bourgeoisie, would simply be unfit to \ncarry out the orders of the proletarian state.\nIt must be affirmed that the actual seizure of all the instruments of labour, \nthe seizure of industry as a whole on the part of the labouring people, is the \nexact opposite of the Proudhonist idea of \u2018redemption\u2019. Under the latter, \nthe individual worker becomes the owner of the dwelling, the peasant \nlandholding, the instruments of labour; under the former, the \u2018labouring \npeople\u2019 remain the collective owner of the houses, factories and instruments \nof labour. The use of these houses, factories and the rest will hardly be \npresented, at least during a transitional period, to individuals or associa\u00ad\ntions without compensation for the costs. Just as the elimination of prop\u00ad\nerty in land does not presuppose the elimination of ground rent but rather \nits transfer, albeit in a modified form, to society. The actual seizure of all \nthe instruments of labour on the part of the labouring people consequently \ndoes not at all exclude the retention of renting and renting out.\n(p. 68)\nWe shall discuss the question touched upon in this commentary, \nnamely the economic foundations of the withering away of the \nstate, in the next chapter. Engels expresses himself extremely cau\u00ad\ntiously, saying that the proletarian state would \u2018scarcely\u2019 permit the \nuse of houses without payment, \u2018at least during the transitional \nperiod\u2019.

And the transition \nto a situation when it will be possible to supply apartments rent- \nfree is connected with the complete \u2018withering away\u2019 of the state.\nSpeaking of the change of policy of the Blanquists, after the \nCommune and under the influence of its experience, to the prin\u00ad\ncipled position of Marxism, Engels formulates this position in \npassing as follows:\nThe necessity of political action by the proletariat and of its dictatorship \nas the transition to the abolition of classes and the state along with \nthem ...\n(P- 55)\nAdmirers of pedantic criticism or the \u2018destroyers of Marxism\u2019 \nwill perhaps see a contradiction between the recognition of the \n\u2018abolition of the state\u2019 and the rejection of this formulation as \nbeing anarchistic in the above-quoted passage from Anti-Diihring. \nIt would not be surprising if the opportunists counted Engels, too, \nas an \u2018anarchist\u2019: the laying of charges of anarchism against interna\u00ad\ntionalists is nowadays becoming more and more widespread among \nthe social-chauvinists.\nIt has always been a teaching of Marxism that with the abolition \nof classes the state will also be abolished.

These people think \nthat we can change a certain thing by changing its name . ..\u2019\nHaving thus shown that authority and autonomy are relative \nconcepts, that the area of their application changes with the various \nphases of social development, that it is absurd to take them as \nabsolutes, and having added that the area of application of machin\u00ad\nery and large-scale production is ever expanding, Engels moves \nfrom general considerations on authority to the question of the \nstate:\nIf the autonomists [he writes] wanted only to say that the social organiza\u00ad\ntion of the future would confine authority entirely to the limits which are \ninevitably prescribed by the conditions of production, we could come to \nterms with each other. But they are blind to all facts that make authority a \nnecessity, and they passionately fight against the word.\nWhy is it that the anti-authoritarianists do not confine themselves to \nshouting against political authority, against the state? All socialists are \nagreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear \nas a result of the future social revolution, i.e. that public functions will lose \ntheir political character and be turned into the simple administrative func\u00ad\ntions of supervising social interests. But the anti-authoritarianists demand \nthat the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social \nconditions that gave birth to it have been abolished. They demand that the \nfirst act of the social revolution should be the abolition of authority.\nHave these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly\n56\n"

And in posing this question, \nEngels takes the bull by the horns: should not the Commune have \nmade more use of the revolutionary power of the state, i.e. of the \nproletariat armed and organized as the ruling class?\nPrevailing official social-democracy usually shrugged off the ques\u00ad\ntion of the concrete tasks of the proletariat in the revolution either \nwith a philistine sneer or, at best, with the sophistic evasion: \u2018Wait \nand see.\u2019 And the anarchists thus obtained the right to attack such \nsocial-democracy for betraying its task of giving the workers a \nrevolutionary education.

This letter, \nwe may observe parenthetically, was first published by Bebel (as \nfar as we know) in the second volume of his memoirs (From My \nLife), which appeared in 1911, i.e. thirty-six years after the letter \nhad been written and posted.\nEngels wrote to Bebel criticizing that same draft of the Gotha \nProgramme which Marx, too, had criticized in his famous letter to \nBracke. Touching on the question of the state in particular, Engels \nsaid as follows:\nThe free people\u2019s state is transformed into a free state. According to the \ngrammatical meaning of these words, a free state is one where the state is \nfree in relation to its citizens, i.e. a state with a despotic government.

It is not surprising that so persistent a repetition of \nopportunist arguments on the state was absorbed by German \nsocial-democracy, especially when Engels\u2019s revolutionary clarifica\u00ad\ntions had been securely filed away and all the conditions of its \ncurrent existence were over a lengthy period \u2018weaning\u2019 it away \nfrom revolution!\n4 Critique of the Draft of the Erfurt Programme\nThe critique of the draft of the Erfurt Programme, sent by Engels \nto Kautsky on 29 June 1891 and published only ten years later in \nDie Neue Zeit, cannot be ignored in an analysis of Marxism\u2019s \nteaching on the state, for this criticism is devoted mainly to just \nthese opportunist views of social-democracy on questions of state \nstructure.\nLet us note in passing that Engels also makes a remarkably valu\u00ad\nable observation on questions of economics which shows how atten\u00ad\ntively and thoughtfully he followed the latest changes in capitalism, \nand how he consequently managed to foresee to a certain extent \nthe tasks of our present-day imperialist epoch. The observation is \nas follows. Referring to the word \u2018planlessness\u2019 [Planlosigkeit] used \nin the draft programme to characterize capitalism, Engels writes:\nWhen we move from joint-stock companies to trusts which take charge of \nand monopolize whole branches of industry, it is not only private produc\u00ad\ntion but also planlessness that ceases to exist.\n(Die Neue Zeit, vol. XX, p. 8, 1901-2)\nHere we have the fundamentals for the theoretical appraisal \nof the latest phase of capitalism, i.e. imperialism; namely that capital\u00ad\nism turns into monopoly capitalism. The last word must be \nemphasized because the bourgeois-reformist assertion that monopoly \ncapitalism or state-monopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism but is \ndescribable as \u2018state socialism\u2019 or something of the sort is a most \nwidespread error. The trusts, of course, did not provide, do not now \nprovide and cannot provide complete planning. But however much \nthey do plan, however much the capitalist magnates calculate in \nadvance the volume of production on a national and even on an \ninternational scale, and however much they regulate it on a planned\n61\n"

For such a republic, without in the least eradicat\u00ad\ning the rule of capital and, therefore, the oppression of the masses \nand class struggle, inevitably leads to such an extension, develop\u00ad\nment, unfolding and intensification of this struggle that, as soon as \nthere arises the possibility of satisfying the underlying interests of \nthe oppressed masses, this possibility is realized inevitably and \nsolely through the dictatorship of the proletariat, through the leader\u00ad\nship of those masses by the proletariat. These are also the \u2018forgotten \nwords\u2019 of Marxism for the entire Second International, and the \noblivion surrounding them was demonstrated with extraordinary \nvividness by the history of the Menshevik Party over the first six \nmonths of the Russian Revolution of 1917.\nOn the question of a federal republic, in connection with the \nnational composition of the population, Engels wrote:\nWhat should take the place of present-day Germany? [with its reactionary \ndivision into petty states, a division which perpetuates all the peculiarities \nof \u2018Prussianism\u2019 instead of dissolving them in Germany as a whole]. In my \nview, the proletariat can only use the form of the one and indivisible \nrepublic. A federal republic in the gigantic territory of the United States is \nstill, on the whole, a necessity, although in the east it is already becoming \nan encumbrance. It would be a step forward in England, where four \nnations live on two islands and, despite the existence of a single parliament, \nthree particular systems of legislation exist side by side. It has long been an \nencumbrance in little Switzerland, and if it is still possible to tolerate a \nfederal republic there, this is only because Switzerland is content with the \nrole of a purely passive member of the European state system. Federal \nSwitzerlandization would be a huge step backwards for Germany. Two \npoints distinguish a union state from a completely unitary state: namely \nthat each individual state entering the union, each canton has its own \nspecial civil and criminal legislation, its own special judicial system; and, \nsecondly, that together with a popular chamber there is also a chamber of \nrepresentatives from the states, a chamber wherein each canton, whether \nlarge or small, votes as such.\nIn Germany the union state constitutes a transition to the com\u00ad\npletely unitary state, and the \u2018revolution from above\u2019 of 1866 and\n64\n"

From 1792 to 1798 each Department of France, each commune \n[Gemeinde] enjoyed complete self-government on the American model, and \nthis is what we too must have. How self-government is to be organized \nand how we can manage without a bureaucracy has been shown to us by \nAmerica and the first French republic, and is being shown even today by \nCanada, Australia and the other English colonies. And such a provincial \n(regional) and communal self-government constitutes much freer institu\u00ad\ntions than for instance Swiss federalism, where the canton admittedly is \nvery independent in relation to the union [i.e. to the federal state as a \nwhole], but is also independent both in relation to the district [Bezirk] and \nin relation to the commune. The cantonal governments appoint the police \ncommissioners [Bezirksstatthalter] and prefects - a feature which is un\u00ad\nknown in English-speaking countries and which we shall have to eradicate \nhere just as resolutely in the future along with the Prussian Landrate and \nRegierungsrate [commissars, police commissioners, governors, and in gen\u00ad\neral all bureaucrats appointed from above].\nAccordingly, Engels proposes to formulate the point in the pro\u00ad\ngramme about self-government as follows:\nComplete self-government for the province [gubernia and region], district \nand community through bureaucrats elected by universal suffrage; the \nabolition of all local and provincial authorities appointed by the state.\nI have already had occasion to indicate - in Pravda (no. 68, 28 \nMay 1917), which was suppressed by the government of Kerenski \nand other \u2018socialist\u2019 ministers - how on this point (and of course \nnot on this point alone) our pseudo-socialist representatives of \npseudo-revolutionary pseudo-democracy were undertaking out\u00ad\nrageous departures from democratism. It is understandable that \npeople who have tied themselves into a \u2018coalition\u2019 with the imperial\u00ad\nist bourgeoisie have remained deaf to these observations.\nIt is extremely important to note that Engels, with the facts at \nhis fingertips, adduces a most precise example to refute a prejudice \nwhich is very widespread, particularly among petty-bourgeois demo\u00ad\ncrats: namely that a federal republic necessarily means greater free\u00ad\ndom than a centralist republic.

Indeed every person, having performed as much social \nlabour as another, receives an equal share of the social product \n(after the above-mentioned deductions).\nPeople, however, are not equal; one is strong, another is weak; \none is married, another is not; one has more children, another has \nfewer, and so on.\nWith an equal performance of labour, and hence an equal share in the \nsocial consumption fund [Marx concludes] one will in fact receive more \nthan another, one will be richer than another, and so forth.
