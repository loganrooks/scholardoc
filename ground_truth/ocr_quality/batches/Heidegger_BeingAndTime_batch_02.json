      "full_text": "Being and Time \nINT. II \nIn taking over Descartes' ontological position Kant made an essential \nomission : he failed to provide an ontology of Dasein. This omission was \na decisive one in the spirit [im Sinne] of Descartes' ownmost Tendencies. \nWith the 'cogito sum' Descartes had claimed that he was putting philo\u00ad\nsophy on a new and firm footing. But what he left undetermined when he \nbegan in this 'radical' way, was the kind of Being which belongs to the \nres cogitans, or-more precisely-the meaning of the Being of the 'sum'.1 By \nworking out the unexpressed ontological foundations of the 'cogito sum', we \nshall complete our sojourn at the second station along the path of our \ndestructive retrospect of the history of ontology. Our Interpretation will \nnot only prove that Descartes had to neglect the question of Being alto\u00ad\ngether; it will also show why he came to suppose that the absolute 'Being\u00ad\ncertain' [\"Gewisssein\"] of the cogito exempted him from raising the ques\u00ad\ntion of the meaning of the Being which this entity possesses. \nYet Descartes not only continued to neglect this and thus to accept a \ncompletely indefinite ontological status for the res cogitans sive mens sive \nanimus ['the thing which cognizes, whether it be a mind or spirit'] : he \nregarded this entity as afundamentum inconcussum, and applied the medieval \nontology to it in carrying through the fundamental considerations of his \nMeditationes. He defined the res cogitans ontologically as an ens; and in the \nmedieval ontology the meaning of Being for such an ens had been fixed \nby understanding it as an ens creatum. God, as ens infinitum, was the ens \ni n  c r e a  t u m. But createdness [Geschaffenheit] in the widest sense of \nsomething's having been produced [Hergestelltheit], was an essential \n25 \nitem in the structure of the ancient conception of Being. The seemingly \nnew beginning which Descartes proposed for philosophizing has revealed \nitself as the implantatiop of a baleful prejudice, which has kept later \ngenerations from making a\"ny thematic ontological analytic of the 'mind' \n[\"Gemiites\"] such as would take the question of Being as a clue and \nwould at the same time come to grips critically with the traditional \nancient ontology. \nEveryone who is acquainted with the middle ages sees that Descartes is \n'dependent' upon medieval scholasticism and employs its terminology. \nBut with this 'discovhy' nothing is achieved philosophically as long as it \nremains obscure to what a profound extent the medieval ontology has \ninfluenced the way in which posterity has determined or failed to deter\u00ad\nmine the ontological character of the res cogitans. The full extent of this \ncannot be estimated until both the meaning and the limitations of the \nancient ontology have been exhibited in terms of an orientation directed \n1 We follow the later editions in reading 'der Seinssinn des \"sum\" '. The earlier editions \nhave an anacoluthic 'den' for 'der'. \n"

MyE'v \nitself--or rather voEiv, that simple awareness of something present-at-\n26 \nhand in its sheer presence-at-hand, 1 which Parmenides had already taken \nto guide him in his own interpretation of Being-has the Temporal \nstructure of a pure 'making-present' of something.11 Those entities which \nshow themselves i n  this and fo r it, and which are understood as entities \nin the most authentic sense, thus get interpreted with regard to the \nPresent; that is, they are conceived as presence (ovula) .3 \nYet the Greeks have managed to interpret Being in this way without \nany explicit knowledge of the clues which function here, without any \nacquaintance with the fundamental ontological function of time or even \nany understanding of it, and without any insight into the reason why this \nfunction is possible. On the contrary, they take time itself as one entity \namong other entities, and try to grasp it in the structure of its Being, \nthough that way of understanding Being which they have taken as their \nhorizon is one which is itself naively and inexplicitly oriented towards \ntime. \nWithin the framework in which we are about to work out the principles \nof the question of Being, we cannot present a detailed Temporal Inter\u00ad\npretation of the foundations of ancient ontology, particularly not of its \nloftiest and purest scientific stage, which is reached in Aristotle. Instead \nwe shall give an interpretation of Aristotle's essay on time, 11 which may \nbe chos\u00eb as providing a way of discriminating the basis and the limitations \nof the ancient science of Being. \nAristotle's essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n von etwas Vorhandenem in seiner puren Vorhandenheit . .  .' The adjective \n'vorhanden' means literally 'betorGthe hand', but this signification has long since given \nway to others. In ordinary German usage it may, for instance, be applied to the stock of \ngoods which a dealer has 'on hand', or to the 'extant' works of an author; and in earlier \nphilosophical writing it could be used, like the word 'Dasein' itself, as a synonym for the \nLatin 'existentia'. Heidegger, however, distinguishes quite sharply between 'Dasein' and \n'Vorhandenheit', using the latter to designate a kind of Being which belongs to things \nother than Dasein. We shall translate 'vorhanden' as 'present-at-hand', and 'Vorhanden\u00ad\nheit' as 'presence-at-hand'. The reader must be careful not to confuse these expressions \nwith our 'presence' ('Anwesenheit') and 'the Present' ('die Gegenwart'), etc., or with a \nfew other verbs\u00dfd adjectives which we may find it convenient to translate by 'present'. \n2 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n des reinen \"Gegenwiirtigens\" von etwas'. The verb 'gegenwiirtigen', which is \nderived from the adjective 'gegenwiirtig', is not a normal German verb, but was used by \nHuserl and is used extensively by Heidegger. While we shall translate it by various forms \nof 'make present', it does not necessarily mean 'making physically present', but often \nmeans something like 'bringing vividly to mind'. \n3 'Das Seiende, das sich in ihm fiir es zeigt und das als das eigentliche Seiende \nverstanden wird, erhlilt demnach seine Auslegung in Riicksicht auf-Gegen-wart, \nd.h. es ist als Anwesenheit (o!lula) begriffen.' The hyphenation of 'Gegen-wart' calls \nattention to the structure of this word in a way which cannot be reproduced in English. \nSee note 2, p. 47, H. 25 above. The pronouns 'ihm' and 'es' presumably both refer back \nto Mynv, though their reference is ambiguous, as our version suggests. \n"

Thus our treatise does not subscribe to a 'stand\u00ad\n}JOint' or represent any special 'direction'; for phenomenology is nothing \nof either sort, nor can it become so as long as it understands itself. The \nexpression 'phenomenology' signifies primarily a methodological concep\u00ad\ntion. This expression does not characterize the what of the objects of \nphilosophical research as subject-matter, but rather the how of that \nresearch. The more genuinely a methodological concept is worked out \nand the more comprehensively it determines the principles on which a \nscience is to be conducted, all the more primordially is it rooted in the way \nwe come to terms with the things themselves, 1 and the farther is it \nremoved from what we call \"technical devices\", though there are many \n5uch devices even in the theoretical disciplines. \nThus the term 'phenomenology' expresses a maxim which can be for-\n28 \nmulated as 'To the things themselves !' It is opposed to all free-floating \nconstructions and accidental findings ; it is opposed to taking over any \nconceptions which only seem to have been demonstrated; it is opposed \nto those pseudo-questions which parade themselves as 'problems', often \nfor generations at a time. Yet this maxim, one may rejoin, is abundantly \nself-evident, and it expresses, moreover, the underlying principle of any \nscientific knowledge whatsoever. Why should anything so self-evident be \ntaken up explicitly in giving a title to a branch of research ? In point of \nfact, the issue here is a kind of 'self-evidence' which we should like to \nbring closer to us, so far as it is important to do so in casting light upon \nthe procedure of our treatise. We shall expound only the preliminary \nconception [Vorbegriff] of phenomenology. \nThis expression has two components : \"phenomenon\" and \"logos\". \nBoth of these go back to terms fr.pm the Greek : cpaw6p.\u00a3vov and .\\6yoS'. \nTaken superficially, the term \"phenomenology\" is formed like \"theology\", \n\"biology\", \"sociology\"-names which may be translated as \"science of \nGod\", \"science of life\", \"science of society\". This would make pheno\u00ad\nmenology the science qf phenomena. We shall set forth the preliminary con\u00ad\nception of phenomenology by characterizing what one has in mind in the \nterm's two components, 'phenomenon' and 'logos', and by establishing \nthe meaning of the na\u0149e in which these are put together. The history of \n1 The appeal to the 'Sachen selbst', which Heidegger presents as virtually a slogan for \nHusserl's phenomenology, is not easy to translate without giving misleading impressions. \nWhat Husser! has in mind is the 'things' that words may be found to signify when their \nsignifications are correctly intuited by the right kind of Anschauung. (Cf. his Logische \nUntersuchungen, vol. 2, part 1, second edition, Halle, 1913, p. 6.) We have followed Marvin \nFarber in adopting 'the things themselves'. (Cf. his The Foundation of Phenomenology, \nCambridge, Mass., 1943, pp. 202-3.) The word 'Sache' will, of course, be translated in \nother ways also. \n"

      "full_text": "Being and Time \nINT. II \nThis is what one is talking about when one speaks of the 'symptoms of \na disease' [\"Krankheitserscheinungen\"]. Here one has in mind certain \noccurrences in the body which show themselves and which, in showing \nthemselves a s thus showing themselves, 'indicate' [\"indizieren\"] some\u00ad\nthing which does not show itself. The emergence [Auftreten] of such \noccurrences, their showing-themselves, goes together with the Being\u00ad\npresent-at-hand of disturbances which do not show themselves. Thus \nappearance, as the appearance 'of something', does not mean showing\u00ad\nitself; it means rather the announcing-itself by [von] something which \ndoes not show itself, but which announces itself through something which \ndoes show itself. Appearing is a not-showing-itself. But the 'not' we find \nhere is by no means to be confused with the privative \"not\" which we \nused in defining the structure of semblance.1 What appears does not show \nitself; and anything which thus fails to show itself, is also something which \ncan never s e e m .2 All indications, presentations, symptoms, and symbols \nhave this basic formal structure of appearing, even though they differ \namong themselves. \nrespect for the translator, the passage shows some signs of hasty constructicm, and a few \ncomments may be helpful. We are told several times that 'appearance' and 'phenome\u00ad\nnon' are to be sharply distinguished; yet we are also reminded that there is a sense in \nwhich they coincide, and even this sense seems to be twofold, though it is not clear that \nHeidegger is fully aware of this. The whole discussion is based upon two further distinc\u00ad\ntions : the distinction between 'showing' ('zeigen') and 'announcing' ('melden') and \n'bringing forth' ('hervorbringen'), and the distinction between ('x') that which 'shows \nitself' ('das Sichzeigende') or which 'does the announcing' ('das Meldende') or which \n'gets brought forth' ('das Hervorgebrachte'), and ()!') that which 'announces itself' \n('das Sichmeldende') or which does the bringing-forth. Heidegger is thus able to intro\u00ad\nduce the following senses of 'Erscheinung' or 'appearance' :  \n1a. an observable eventy, such a s  a symptom whi\u00c9 announces a disease x by showing \nitself, and in or through which x announces itself without showing itself; \n1 b. y's showing-itself; \n, \n2. \nx's announcing-itself in or through y; \n3a. the 'mere appearance' y which x may /iring jOTth when x is of such a kind that its \nreal nature can ntver be made manifest; \n3b. the 'mere appearance' which is the bringing-forth of a 'mere appearance' in sense 3a. \nHeidegger makes abundantly clear that sense 2 is the proper sense of 'appearance' and \nthat senses 3a and 3b are the proper senses of 'mere appearance'. On H. 30 and 31 he \nconcedes that sense 1b corresponds to the primordial sense of 'phenomenon' ;  but his \ndiscussion on H. 28 suggests that 1a corresponds to this more accurately, and he reverts \nto this position towards the end of H. 30. \n1 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n als welches es die Struktur des Scheins bestimmt.' (The older editions omit \nthe 'es'.) \n2 'Was sich in der Weise nicht zeigt, wie das Erscheinende, kann auch nie scheinen.' \nThis passage is ambiguous, but presumably 'das Erscheinende' is to be interpreted as the \nx of our note 1, p. 51, not our y. The reader should notice that our standardized transla\u00ad\ntion of 'scheinen' as 'seem' is one which her\u00ca becomes rather misleading, even though \nthese words correspond fairly well in ordinary usage. In distinguishing between 'scheinen' \nand 'erscheinen', Heidegger seems to be insisting that 'scheinen' can be done only by \nthe y which 'shows itself' or 'does the announcing', not by the x which 'announces \nitself' in or throughy, even though German usage does not differentiate these verbs quite \nso sharply. \n"

If, as has \nbecome quite customary nowadays, one defines \"truth\" as something that \n'really' pertains to judgment, 2 and if one then invokes the support of \nAristotle with this thesis, not only is this unjustified, but, above all, the \nGreek conception of truth has been misunderstood. A'ta87Ja'iS', the sheer \nsensory perception of something, is 'true' in the Greek sense, and indeed \nmore primordially than the AoyoS' which we have been discussing. Just \nas seeing aims at colours, any a'ta87JU\u00a3S' aims at its 't8\u00a3a (those entities \nwhich are genuinely accessible only through it and for it) ; and to that \nextent this perception is always true. This means that seeing always \ndiscovers colours, and hearing always discovers sounds. Pure voE'iv is \nthe perception of the simplest determinate ways of Being which entities \nas such may posse\u0222s, and it perceives them just by looking at them. 3 \nThis voE'iv is what is 'true' in the purest and most primordial sense ; that \nis to say, it merely discovers, and it does so in such a way that it can never \ncover up. This voE'iv can never cover up; it can never be false ; it can at \nworst remain a non-perceiving, ayvo\u00a3'iv, not sufficing for straightforward \nand appropriate access. \nWhen something no longer takes the form of just letting something be \n34 \nseen, but is always harking back to something else to which it points, so \nthat it lets something be seen as something, it thus acquires a synthesis\u00ad\nstructure, and with this it takes over the possibility oftovering up.' The \n'truth of judgments', however, is merely the opposite of this covering-up, \na secondary phenomenon of truth, with more than one kind of foundation. 6 \nBoth realism and idealism have-with equal thoroughness-missed the \nmeaning of the Greek conception of truth, in terms of which only the \n1 The Greek words for 'truth' (\u00e0 &>.\u00198\u00a3\u2022a, Td &>.\"18/s) are compounded of the \nprivative prefix ci.-\n('not') and the verbal stem ->.a9- ('to escape notice', 'to be \nconcealed'). The truth may thus be looked upon as that which is un-concealed, that \nwhich gets discovered or uncovered ('entdeckt'). \nI 'Wenn man . . .  Wahrheit als das bestimmt, was \"eigentlich\" dem Urteil zukommt \u2022 \u2022 \u2022  ' \na '  \n.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n das schlicht hinsehende Vernehmen der einfachsten Seinsbestimmungen des \nSeienden als solchen.' \n' 'Was nicht mehr die Vollzugsform des reinen Sehenlassens hat, sondern je im Auf\u00ad\nweisen auf ein anderes rekurriert und so je etwas als etwas sehen lasst, das iibernimmt mit \ndieser Synthesisstruktur die Moglichkeit des Verdeckens.' \n6 ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n ein mehrfach fundiertes Phiinomen von Wahrheit.'

This is the formal meaning of that branch \nof research which calls itself \"phenomenology\". But here we are expressing \nnothing else than the maxim formulated above : 'To the things themselves !' \nThus the term \"phenomenology\" is quite different in its meaning froni \nexpressions such as \"theology\" and the like. Those terms designate the \n1 Heidegger is here pointing out that the word il\u0114os is etymologically akin to the \nverb Uym\u2022, which has among its numerous meanings those of laying out, exhibiting, setting \nforth, recounting, telling a tau, malcing a statement. Thus il&yos as ilynv can be thought of \nas the faculty of 'reason' ('Vernunft') which makes such activities possible. But iloyos can \nalso mean -rei ileyoll-&ov (that which is laid out, exhibited, set forth, told) ; in this sense \nit is the underlying subject matter (To VtrOK\u00a3lfL&ov) to which one addresses oneself and \nwhich one discusses ('Ansprechen und Besprechen') ; as such it lies 'at the bottom' ('zurn \nGrunde') of what is exhibited or told, and is thus the 'ground' or 'reason' ('Grund') for \ntelling it. But when something is exhibited or told, it is exhibited in its relatedness ('in \nseiner Bezogenheit') ; and in this way iiOyos as il\u00a3yOj..&ov comes to stand for just such a \nrelation or relationship ('Beziehung und Verhaltnis'). The three senses here distinguished \ncorrespond to three senses of the Latin 'ratio', by which iloyos was traditionally translated , \nthough Heidegger explicitly calls attention to only one of these. Notice that 'Beziehung' \n(which we translate as 'relation') can also be used in some contexts where 'Ansprechen' \n(our 'addressing oneself') would be equally appropriate\u0118 Notice further that 'Verhaltnis' \n(our 'relationship'), which is ordinarily a synonym for 'Beziehung', can, like il&yos and \n'ratio', also refer to the special kind of relationship which one finds in a mathematical \nproportion. The etymological connection between 'Vernehmen' and 'Vernunft' should \nalso be noted. \n"

Only as \nphenomenology, is ontology possible. In the phenomenological conception of \n\"phenomenon\" what one has in mind as that which shows itself is the \nBeing of entities, its meaning, its modifications and derivatives.1 And this \nshowing-itself is not just any showing-itself, nor is it some such thing as \n36 \nappearing. Least of all can the Being of entities ever be anything such that \n'behind it' stands something else 'which does not appear'. \n'Behind' the phenomena of phenomenology there is essentially nothing \nelse; on the other hand, what is to become a phenomenon can be hidden. \nAnd just because the phenomena are proximally and for the most part \nnot given, there is need for phenomenology. Covered-up-ness is the counter\u00ad\nconcept to 'phenomenon'. \nThere are various ways in which phenomena can be covered up. In the \nfirst place, a phenomenon can be covered up in the sense that it is still \nquite undiscovered. It is neither known nor unknown. 2 \nMoreover, a \nphenomenon can be buried over [ verschiittet]. This means that it has at some \ntime been discovered but has deteriorated [ verfiel] to the point of getting \ncovered up again. This covering-up can become complete; or rather-and \nas a rule-what has been discovered earlier may still be visible, though \nonly as a semblance. Yet so much semblance, so much 'Being'. 3 This cover\u00ad\ning-up as a 'disguising' is both the most frequent and the most dangerous, \nfor here the possibilities of deceiving and misleading are especially \nstubborn. Within a 'system', perhaps, those structures of Being-and \ntheir concepts-which are still available but veiled in their indigenous \ncharacter, may claim their rights. For when they have been bound \ntogether constructively in a system, they present themselves as something \n'clear', requiring no further justification, and thus can serve as the point \nof departure for a process of deduction. \n\"' \nThe covering-up itself, whether in the se\u0223se of hiddenness, burying\u00ad\nover, or disguise, has in turn two possibilities. There are coverings-up \nwhich are accidental; there are also some which are necessary, grounded \nin what the thing discovered consists in [der Bestandart des Entdeckten]. \nWhenever a phenomenological concept is drawn from primordial sources, \n1 'Der phiinomenologische Begriff von Phiinomen meint als das Sichzeigende das Sein \ndes Seienden, seinen Sinn, seine Modifikationen und Derivate.' \n11 'Ober seinen Bestand gibt es weder Kenntnis noch Unkenntnir.

And the difficulty of this \nkind of research lies in making it self-critical in a positive sense. \nThe way in which Being and its structures are encountered in the mode \nof phenomenon is one which must first of all be wrested from the objects \nof phenomenology. Thus the very point of departure [Ausgang] for our \nanalysis requires that it be secured by the proper method, just as much as \ndoes our access [..(ugang] to the phenomenon, or our passage [Durchgang] \nthrough whatever is prevalently covering it up.

But to the extent that by uncovering the meaning of Being \nand the basic structures of Dasein in general we may exhibit the horizon \nfor any further ontological study of those entities which do not have the \ncharacter ofDasein, this hermeneutic also becomes a 'hermeneutic' in the \nsense of working out the conditions on which the possibility of any onto\u00ad\nlogical investigation depends.

The Being of any such entity \nis in each case mine.1 These entities, in their Being, comport themselves \ntowards their Being. As entities with such Being, they are delivered over \n42 \nto their own Being.2 Being is that which is an issue for every such entity.3 \nThis way of characterizing Dasein has a double consequence : \nI .  The 'essence' [\"Wesen\"] of this entity lies in its \"to be\" [Zu-sein] . Its \nBeing-what-it-is [Was-sein] (essentia) must, so far as we can speak of it at \nall, be conceived in terms of its Being (existentia). But here our ontological \ntask is to show that when we choose to designate the Being of this entity \nas \"existence\" [Existenz], this term does not and cannot have the onto\u00ad\nlogical signification of the traditional term \"existentia\"; ontologically, \nexistentia is tantamount to Being-present-at-hand, a kind of Being which is \nessentially inappropriate to entities of Dasein's character. To avoid \ngetting bewildered, we shall always use the Interpretative expression \n\"presence-at-hand\" for the term \"existentia\", while the term \"existence\", as \na designation of Being, will be allotted solely to Dasein. \nThe essence of Dasein lies in its existence. Accordingly those characteristics \nwhich can be exhibited in this entity are not 'properties' present-at-hand \nof some entity which 'looks' so and so and is itself present-at-hand ; \nthey are in each case possible ways for it to be, and no more than that. \nAll the Being-as-it-is [So-sein] which this entity possesses is primarily \nBeing. So when we designate this entity with the term 'Dasein', we are \nexpressing not its \"what\" (as if it were a table, house or tree) but its Being. \n2. That Being which is an issue for this entity in its very Being, is in \neach case mine. Thus Dasein is never to be taken ontologically as an \n1 'Das Seiende, dessen Analyse zur Aufgabe steht, sind wir je selbst. Das Sein dieses \nSeienden ist je meines.' The reader must not get the impression that there is anything \nsolipsistic about the second of these sentences. The point is merely that the kind of Being \nwhich belongs to Dasein is of a sort which any of us may call his own. \nII 'Ais Seiendes dieses Seins ist es seinem eigenen Sein iiberantwortet.' The earlier \neditions read ' . . .  seinem eigenen Zu-sein \u2022\n.\n.\n ' \na See note 2, p. 28, H. 8 above. \n"

I \ninstance or special case of some genus of entities as things that are \npresent-at-hand.1 To entities such as these, their Being is 'a matter of \nindifference' ;2 or more precisely, they 'are' such that their Being can be \nneither a matter of indifference to them, nor the opposite. Because \nDasein has in each case mineness [Jemeinigkeit], one must always use a \npersonal pronoun when one addresses it : 'I am', 'you are'. \nFurthermore, in each case Dasein is mine to be in one way or another. \nDasein has always made some sort of decision as to the way in which it is \nin each case mine [je meines]. That entity which in its Being has this very \nBeing as an issue, comports itself towards its Being as its ownmost pos\u00ad\nsibility. In each case Dasein is its possibility, and it 'has' this possibility, \nbut not just as a property [eigenschaftlich], as something present-at-hand \nwould. And because Dasein is in each case essentially its own possibility, \nit can, in its very Being, 'choose' itself and win itself; it can also lose itself \nand never win itself; or only 'seem' to do so. But only in so far as it is \n43 \nessentially something which can be authentic-that is, something of its own3 \n-can ithavelostitselfand not yet won itself. As modesofBeing, authenticity \nand inauthenticity (these expressions have been chosen terminologically in a \nstrict sense) are both grounded in the fact that any Dasein whatsoever is \ncharacterized by mineness. 4 But the inauthenticity ofDasein does not signify \nany 'less' Being or any 'lower' degree of Being. Rather it is the case that \neven in its fullest concretion Dasein can be characterized by inauthenticity \n-when busy, when excited, when interested, when ready for enjoyment. \nThe two characteristics of Dasein which we have sketched-the \npriority of 'existentia' over essentia, and the fact that Dasein is in each case \nmine [die Jemeinigkeit]-have already indicated that in the analytic of \nthis entity we are facing a peculiar phenomenal domain. Dasein does not \nhave the kind of Being which belongs to something merely present-at\u00ad\nhand within the world, nor does it ever have it. So neither is it to be \npresented thematically as something we come across in the same way as \n1 ' .  \n. \n\u2022 als Vorhandenem'. The earlier editions have the adjective 'vorhandenem' \ninstead of the substantive. \n2 'gleichgiiltig'. This adjective must be distinguished from the German adjective \n'indifferent', though they might both ordinarily be translated by the English 'indifferent', \nwhich we shall reserve exclusively for the former. In most passages, the latter is best \ntranslated by 'undifferentiated' or 'without further differentiation' ; occasionally, how\u00ad\never, it seems preferable to tram.late it by 'Indifferent' with an initial capital. We shall \nfollow similar conventions with the nouns 'Gieichgiiltigkeit' and 'Indifferenz'. \n3 'Und weil Dasein wesenhaft je seine Moglichkeit ist, kann dieses Seiende in seinem \nSein sich selbst \"wii.hlen\", gewinnen, es kann sich verlieren, bzw. nie und our \"scheinbar\" \ngewinnen. Verloren habenkann es sich our und noch nicht sich gewonnen haben kann es \nnur, sofern es seinem \\.Yesen nach mogliches eigentliches, das heisst sich zueigen ist.' \nOlder editions have 'je wesenhaft' and 'zueigenes'. The connection between 'eigentlich' \n('authentic', 'real') and 'eigen' ('own') is lost in translation. \n4. ' \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n das Dasein iiberhaupt durch J emeini_g_kc;it bestimmt ist.' \n"

The right way of presenting it is \nso far from self-evident that to determine what form it shall take is itself \nan essential part of the ontological analytic of this entity. Only by pre\u00ad\nsenting this entity in the right way can we have any understanding of its \nBeing. No matter how provisional our analysis may be, it always requires \nthe assurance that we have started correctly. \nIn determining itself as an entity, Dasein always does so in the light of \na possibility which it is itself and which, in its very Being, it somehow \nunderstands. This is the formal meaning of Dasein's existential constitu\u00ad\ntion. But this tells us that if we are to Interpret this entity ontologically, the \nproblematic of its Being must be developed from the existentiality of its \nexistence. This cannot mean, however, that \"Dasein\" is to be construed \nin terms of some concrete possible idea of existence. At the outset of our \nanalysis it is particularly important that Dasein should not be Interpreted \nwith the differentiated character [Differenz] of some definite way of \nexisting, but that it should be uncovered [aufgedcckt] in the undiffer\u00ad\nentiated character which it has proximally and for the most part. This \nundifferentiated character of Dasein's everydayness is not nothing, but a \npositive phenomenal characteristic of this entity. Out of this kind of Being \n-and back into it again-is all existing, such as it is.1 We call this every\u00ad\nday undifferentiated character of Dasein \"averageness\" [ Durchschnittlichkeit] . \nAnd because this average everydayness makes up what is ontically \nproximal for this entity, it has again and again been passed over in expli\u00ad\ncating Dasein. That which is ontically closest and well known, is onto\u00ad\nlogically the farthest and not known at all ; and its ontological signification \nis constantly overlooked. When Augustine asks: \"Quid autem propinquius \nmeipso mihi?\" and must answer: \"ego certe laboro hie fl laboro in meipso : \n44 \nfactus sum mihi terra dificultatis et sudoris nimii\", 1 this applies not only to the \nontical and pre-ontological opaqueness of Dasein but even more to the \nontological task which lies ahead; for not only must this entity not be \nmissed in that kind of Being in which it is phenomenally closest, but it \nmust be made accessible by a positive characterization. \nDasein's average everydayness, however, is not to be taken as a mere \n'aspect'. Here too, and even in the mode of inauthenticity, the structure \nof existentiality lies a priori. And here too Dasein's Being is an issue for it \nin a definite way; and Dasein comports itself towards it in the mode of \naverage everydayness, even if this is only the mode of fleeing in the face \nof it and forgetfulness thereof 2 \n1 'A us dieser Seinsart hera us und in sie zuriick ist alles Existieren, wie est ist.' \n2 'Auch in ihr geht es dem Dasein in bestimmter Weise urn sein Sein, zu dem es sich \nim Modus der durchschnittlichen Alltaglichkeit verhalt und sei es auch nur im Modus \nder Flucht davor und des Vergessens seiner.'

More literally : 'the entity that \nencounters within the world.' While Heidegger normally uses the verb 'begegnen' in this \nactive intransitive sense, a similar construction with the English 'encounter' is unidio\u00ad\nmatic and harsh. We shall as a rule use either a passive construction (as in 'entities en\u00ad\ncountered') or an active transitive construction (as in 'entities we encounter'). \n3 'Als Zugangsart zu ihm gilt das vo\u00a3iv bzw. der .\\oyos.' Here we follow the reading \nof the earlier editions. In the later editions, 'Zugangsart', which is used rather often, is \nhere replaced by 'Zugangsort', which occurs very seldom and is perhaps a misprint. This \nlater version might be translated as follows : 'vo\u00a3iv (or the .\\oyos, as the case may be) \nia accepted as the locus of acces to such entities.'

The connection between these two modes of the characters of \nBeing cannot be handled until the horizon for the question of Being has \nbeen clarified. \nIn our introduction we have already intimated that in the existential \nanalytic of Dasein we also make headway with a task which is hardly \nless pressing than that of the question of Being itself-the task of laying \nbare that a priori basis which must be visible before the question of 'what \nman is' can be discussed philosophically. The existential analytic ofDasein \ncomes bifore any psychology or anthropology, and certainly before any \nbiology. While these too are ways in which Dasein can be investigated, we \ncan define the theme of our analytic with greater precision if we dis\u00ad\ntinguish it from these.

We must \nshow that those investigations and formulations of the question which have \nbeen aimed at Dasein heretofore, have missed the real philosophical pro\u00ad\nblem (notwithstanding their objective fertility), and that as long as they \npersist in missing it, they have no right to claim that they can accomplish \nthat for which they are basically striving. In distinguishing the existential \nanalytic from anthropology, psychology, and biology, we shall confine \nourselves to what is in principle the ontological question. Our distinctions \nwill necessarily be inadequate from the standpoint of 'scientific theory' \nsimply because the scientific structure of the above-mentioned disciplines \n(not, indeed, the 'scientific attitude' of those who work to advance them) \nis today thoroughly questionable and needs to be attacked in new ways \nwhich must have their source in ontological problematics. \nHistoriologically, the aim of the existential analytic can be made \nplainer by considering Descartes, who is credited with providing the point \n46 \nof departure for modern philosophical inquiry by his discovery of the \n\"cogito sum\". He investigates the \"cogitare\" of the \"ego\", at least within \ncertain limits.

To orient the \nanalysis of Dasein towards the 'life of primitive peoples' can have positive \nsignificance [Bedeutung] as a method because 'primitive phenomena' \nare often less concealed and less complicated by extensive self-interpreta\u00ad\ntion on the part of the Dasein in question. Primitive Dasein often speaks \nto us more directly in terms of a primordial absorption in 'phenomena' \n(taken in a pre-phenomenological sense).

Whether the everyday \npsychology or even the scientific psychology and sociology which the \nethnologist brings with him can provide any scientific assurance that we \ncan have proper access to the phenomena we are studying, and can inter\u00ad\npret them and transmit them in the right way, has not yet been established. \nHere too we are confronted with the same state of affairs as in the other \ndisciplines we have discussed. Ethnology itself already presupposes as its \nclue an inadequate analytic ofDasein. But since the positive sciences neither \n'can' nor should wait for the ontological labours of philosophy to be done, \nthe further course of research will not take the form of an 'advance' but \nwill be accomplished by recapitulating what has already been ontically dis\u00ad\ncovered, and by purifying it in a way which is ontologically more trans\u00ad\nparent.xl \n52 \nNo matter how easy it may be to show how ontological problematics \ndiffer formally from ontical research there are still difficulties in carrying \nout an existential analytic, especially in malcing a start. This task includes \na desideratum which philosophy has long found disturbing but has con\u00ad\ntinually refused to achieve : to work out the idea of a 'natural conception of the \nworld'.

A Preliminary Sketch of Being-in-the-World, in terms of an Orientation \ntowards Being-in as such \nIN our preparatory discussions (Section g) we have brought out some \ncharacteristics of Being which will provide us with a steady light for our \nfurther investigation, but which will at the same time become structurally \n53 \nconcrete as that investigation continues. Dasein is an entity which, in its \nvery Being, comports itself understandingly towards that Being. In saying \nthis, we are calling attention to the formal concept of existence. Dasein exists. \nFurthermore, Dasein is an entity which in each case I myself am. Mineness \nbelongs to any existent Dasein, and belongs to it as the condition which \nmakes authenticity and inauthenticitypossible. In each case Dasein exists in \none or the other of these two modes, or else it is modally undifferentiated.1 \nBut these are both ways in which Dasein's Being takes on a definite \ncharacter, and they must be seen and understood a priori as grounded \nupon that state of Being which we have called \"Being-in-the-world'. An \ninterpretation of this constitutive state is needed if we are to set up our \nanalytic of Dasein correctly. \nThe compound expression 'Being-in-the-world' indicates in the very way \nwe have coined it, that it stands for a unitary phenomenon. This primary \ndatum must be seen as a whole. But while Being-in-the-world cannot be \nbroken up into contentswhichmaybe pieced together, this doesnotprevent \nit from having several constitutive items in its structure. Indeed the pheno\u00ad\nmenal datum which our expression indicates is one which may, in fuct, be \nlooked at in three ways. If we study it, keepingthewholephenomenon firmly \nin mind beforehand, the following items may be brought out for emphasis: \nFirst, the 'in-the-world'. With regard to this there arises the task of \ninquiring into the ontological structure of the 'world' and defining the \nidea of worldhood as such. (See the third chapter of this Division.) \n1 'Zum existierenden Dasein gehiirt die Jemeinigkeit als Bedingung der Miiglichkeit \nvon Eigentlichkeit und Uneigentlichkeit. Dasein existiert je in einem dieser Modi, bzw. \nin der modalen lndifferenz ihrer.' \n"
