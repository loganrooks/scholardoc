The notion of a past whose meaning\ncould not be thought in the form of a (past) present marks the\nimpossible-unthinkable-unstatable not only for philosophy in general but even\nfor a thought of being which would seek to take a step outside phil-\nosophy. This notion, however, does become a theme in the meditation\nof the trace announced in Levinas\u2019s most recent writings. In the living\npresent, the notion of which is at once the most simple and most\ndi\ufb03cult of notions, all temporal alterity can be constituted and appear\nas such: as other past present, other future present, other absolute\norigins relived in intentional modi\ufb01cation, in the unity and actuality of\nmy living present. Only the actual unity of my living present permits\nother presents (other absolute origins) from appearing as such, in what\nis called memory or anticipation (for example, but in truth in the\nconstant movement of temporalization). But only the alterity of past\nand future presents permits the absolute identity of the living present\nas the self-identity of non-self identity. One would have to show,51 on\nthe basis of the Cartesian Meditations, and given the reduction of every\nproblem of factual genesis, how the question of anteriority in the relation\nbetween the constitution of other as other present and the constitution of\nthe other as Others is a false question, which must refer to a common\nstructural root. Although in the Cartesian Meditations Husserl evokes only\nthe analogy of the two movements (Sec. 52), in many of the unpublished\nworks he seems to hold them to be inseparable.\nIn the last analysis, if one wishes to determine violence as the neces-\nsity that the other not appear as what it is, that it not be respected\nexcept in, for, and by the same, that it be dissimulated by the same\nin the very freeing of its phenomenon, then time is violence.

The silent opening of the question about history as\n\ufb01nitude and violence permits the appearance of history as such; it is the\ncall (to) (of) an eschatology which dissimulates its own opening,\ncovers this opening with its own noise as soon as the opening stands\nforth and is determined.

(\u201cNaturally,\nit is not our intention to place the Being of the ideal on the same level as\nthe Being-thought of the \ufb01ctional or the absurd.\u201d54 Hundreds of analogous texts\ncould be cited.) But if Husserl can write this, and if, therefore, he\npresupposes access to a meaning of Being in general, how can he\ndistinguish his idealism as a theory of knowledge from metaphysical\nidealism? The latter too, posited the unreal Being of the ideal. Husserl\ndoubtless would respond, thinking of Plato, that the ideal was realized\nwithin metaphysical idealism, that is, that it was substanti\ufb01ed, hypos-\ntasized, as soon as it was not understood essentially, in each of its\naspects, as noema, and as soon as one imagined that it could be without\nin some way being thought or envisaged. This situation would not have\nbeen totally modi\ufb01ed later when the eidos became originally and essen-\ntially noema only in the Understanding or Logos of an in\ufb01nite subject:\nGod.

In reality, there is not even a distinction\nin the usual sense of the word, between Being and existent. For reasons\nof essence, and \ufb01rst because Being is nothing outside the existent, and\nbecause the opening amounts to the ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence, it is\nimpossible to avoid the ontic metaphor in order to articulate Being in\nlanguage, in order to let Being circulate in language.

Renan and Nietzsche, for example,\nrefer to respiration as the etymological origin of the word Being when\nthey wish to reduce the meaning of what they take to be a concept\u2014the\nindeterminate generality of Being\u2014to its modest metaphorical origin.\n(Renan: On the Origin of Language.

In a letter to X . . ., dated March 1638, Descartes explains that the\nproposition \u201c\u2018 I breathe, therefore I am\u2019 concludes nothing, if it has not\nbeen proven previously that one exists, or if one does not imply: I think\nthat I breathe (even if I am mistaken in this), therefore I am; and it is\nnothing other to state in this sense I breathe, therefore I am than I think,\ntherefore I am.\u201d Which means, in terms of what concerns us here, that the\nmeaning of respiration is always but a dependent and particular\ndetermination of my thought and my existence, and a fortiori of\nthought and of Being in general. Supposing that the word \u201cBeing\u201d is\nderived from a word meaning \u201crespiration\u201d (or any other determined\nthing), no etymology or philology\u2014as such, and as determined\nsciences\u2014will be able to account for the thought for which \u201crespir-\nation\u201d (or any other determined thing) becomes a determination\nof Being among others. Here, for example, no philology will be able\nto account for the gesture of Descartes\u2019s thought. One must travel\nother roads\u2014or an other reading of Nietzsche\u2014in order to trace the\ngenealogy of the unheard-of meaning of Being.\nThis is a \ufb01rst reason why the \u201crelation with an existent,\u201d with some-\none (the ethical relation), cannot be \u201cdominated\u201d by \u201ca relation with\nthe Being of the existent (a relation of knowledge).\u201d\nSecond reason: the \u201crelation with the Being of the existent,\u201d which\nis in no way a relation, above all is not a \u201crelation of knowledge.\u201d65 It is\nnot a theory, as we have seen, and teaches us nothing about what is. It\nis because it is not science that Heidegger sometimes refuses it even the\nname of ontology, after having distinguished it from metaphysics, and\neven from fundamental ontology. Since it is not knowledge, the\nthought of Being is not to be confused with the concept of pure Being\nas undetermined generality.

Now, according to\nLevinas, all violence is a violence of the concept; and both Is Ontology\nFundamental? and Totality and In\ufb01nity interpret the thought of Being as a\nconcept of Being. Opposing himself to Heidegger, Levinas writes,\namong many other similar passages: \u201cIn our relation with the Other,\nthe latter does not a\ufb00ect us on the basis of a concept\u201d (Is Ontology\nFundamental?). According to Levinas, it is \ufb01nally the absolutely\nundetermined concept of Being which o\ufb00ers the Other to our under-\nstanding, that is, to our power and our violence. Now Heidegger is\nemphatic on this point: the Being which is in question is not the concept to\nwhich the existent (for example, someone) is to be submitted (sub-\nsumed). Being is not the concept of a rather indeterminate and abstract\npredicate, seeking to cover the totality of existents in its extreme uni-\nversality: (1) because it is not a predicate, and authorizes all predica-\ntion; (2) because it is \u201colder\u201d than the concrete presence of the ens; (3)\nbecause belonging to Being does not cancel any predicative di\ufb00erence,\nbut, on the contrary, permits the emergence of every possible di\ufb00er-\nence.66 Being is therefore transcategorical, and Heidegger would say of\nit what Levinas says of the other: it is \u201crefractory to the category\u201d (TI).\n\u201cThe question of Being as a question of the possibility of the concept\nof Being arises from the preconceptual comprehension of Being,\u201d67\nwrites Heidegger, opening a dialogue and a repetition, (as concerns the\nHegelian concept of pure Being as nothingness), which will not cease\nto deepen and, in the style which is almost always that of Heidegger\u2019s\ndialogue with the thinkers of tradition, will not cease to permit Hegel\u2019s\ndiscourse to grow and to speak\u2014Hegel\u2019s discourse as that of all of\nmetaphysics (Hegel included, or rather, being entirely included in\nHegel).\nThus, the thought or pre-comprehension of Being signi\ufb01es nothing\nless than a conceptual or totalitarian com-prehension. What we have\njust said of Being could also be said of the same.68 To treat Being (and\nthe same) as categories, or to treat the \u201crelationship to Being\u201d as\na relation to a category which itself could be (by \u201creversal of terms,\u201d\nTI) posed afterward, or subordinated to a determined relation (an\nethical relation, for example)\u2014is this not to forbid oneself every\ndetermination (the ethical one, for example) from the outset?

Which would be entirely\ncoherent if the face was only glance, but it is also speech; and in speech\nit is the phrase which makes the cry of need become the expression of\ndesire. Now, there is no phrase which is indeterminate, that is, which\ndoes not pass through the violence of the concept. Violence appears\nwith articulation. And the latter is opened only by (the at \ufb01rst preconcep-\ntual) circulation of Being. The very elocution of nonviolent metaphys-\nics is its \ufb01rst disavowal. Levinas doubtless would not deny that every\nhistorical language carries within it an irreducible conceptual moment,\nand therefore a certain violence. From his point of view, the origin and\npossibility of the concept are simply not the thought of Being, but the\ngift of the world to the other as totally-other (cf., for example, TI,\np.175). In its original possibility as o\ufb00er, in its still silent intention,\nlanguage is nonviolent (but can it be language, in this pure intention?).\nIt becomes violent only in its history, in what we have called the\nphrase, which obliges it to articulate itself in a conceptual syntax opening\nthe circulation of the same, permitting itself to be governed both by\n\u201contology\u201d and by what remains, for Levinas, the concept of concepts:\nBeing. Now, for Levinas, the concept of Being would be only an abstract\nmeans produced for the gift of the world to the other who is above Being.\nHence, only in its silent origin, before Being, would language be non-\nviolent. But why history? Why does the phrase impose itself? Because if\none does not uproot the silent origin from itself violently, if one\ndecides not to speak, then the worst violence will silently cohabit the\nidea of peace? Peace is made only in a certain silence, which is determined\nand protected by the violence of speech. Since speech says nothing\nother than the horizon of this silent peace by which it has itself sum-\nmoned and that it is its mission to protect and to prepare, speech\ninde\ufb01nitely remains silent. One never escapes the economy of war.\nIt is evident that to separate the original possibility of speech\u2014as\nnon-violence and gift\u2014from the violence necessary in historical actu-\nality is to prop up thought by means of transhistoricity. Which Levinas\ndoes explicitly, despite his initial critique of Husserlian \u201canhistori-\ncism.\u201d For Levinas, the origin of meaning is nonhistory, is \u201cbeyond\nhistory.\u201d One would then have to ask whether it is any longer possible\nviolence and metaphysics 185\n"

And whether the eschatology invoked can be\nseparated from every reference to history. For our own reference to history, here,\nis only contextual. The economy of which we are speaking does not any longer accom-\nmodate the concept of history such as it has always functioned, and which it is di\ufb03cult, if\nnot impossible, to lift from its teleological or eschatological horizon.\nThe ahistoricity of meaning at its origin is what profoundly separ-\nates Levinas from Heidegger, therefore. Since Being is history for the\nlatter, it is not outside di\ufb00erence, and thus, it originally occurs as (non-\nethical) violence, as dissimulation of itself in its own unveiling. That\nlanguage, thereby, always hides its own origin is not a contradiction,\nbut history itself. In the ontological-historical87 violence which permits\nthe thinking of ethical violence, in economy as the thought of Being,\nBeing is necessarily dissimulated. The \ufb01rst violence is this dissimula-\ntion, but it is also the \ufb01rst defeat of nihilistic violence, and the \ufb01rst\nepiphany of Being. Being, thus, is less the primum cognitum, as was said,\nthan the \ufb01rst dissimulated, and these two propositions are not contradict-\nory. For Levinas, on the contrary, Being (understood as concept) is the\n\ufb01rst dissimulating, and the ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence thereby would\nneutralize di\ufb00erence, the in\ufb01nite alterity of the totally-other. The\nontico-ontological di\ufb00erence, moreover, would be conceivable only on\nthe basis of the idea of the In\ufb01nite, of the unanticipatable irruption of\nthe totally-other existent. For Levinas, as for Heidegger, language\nwould be at once a coming forth and a holding back [r\u00e9serve],\nenlightenment and obscurity; and for both, dissimulation would be a\nconceptual gesture. But for Levinas, the concept is on the plane of\nBeing; for Heidegger it is on the plane of ontic determination.\nThis schema accentuates their opposition but, as is often the case,\nalso permits one to conjecture about their proximity: the proximity of\ntwo \u201ceschatologies\u201d which by opposed routes repeat and put into\nquestion the entire \u201cphilosophical\u201d adventure issued from Platonism.\nInterrogate it simultaneously from within and without, in the form of\na question to Hegel, in whom this adventure is thought and recapitu-\nlated.

For\nMalebranche, in\ufb01nity is its very form: \u201cThe idea of the extended in\ufb01n-\nite thus encloses more reality than that of the heavens; and the idea of\nthe in\ufb01nite in all genres of Being, that which corresponds to this word,\nBeing, the in\ufb01nitely perfect being, contains in\ufb01nitely more [reality),\nalthough the perception with which this idea a\ufb00ects us is the slightest\nof all; and is slighter to the extent that it is more vast, and consequently\nin\ufb01nitely slight because in\ufb01nite\u201d (Entretien d\u2019un philosophe chr\u00e9tien avec un\nphilosophe chinois.)

Thus, the question about the Being of the\nexistent would not only introduce\u2014among others the question about\nthe existent-God; it already would suppose God as the very possibility of its\nquestion, and as the answer within its question.

The Idiot (Idiota), an\nadmirable meditation by Nicholas of Cusa, develops this implication of\nGod in every question, and \ufb01rst in the question of God. For example:\nThe Idiot: See how easie the dif\ufb01cultie is in divine things, that it always\noffers it self to the seeker, in the same manner that it is sought for. The\nOrator: Without doubt, there is nothing more wonderfull.

One could show, perhaps, that\nthe phenomenological project itself is born of an initial failure of this\nattempt.\nIn Philosophie der Arithmetik, the objectivity of a structure, that of num-\nbers and arithmetical series\u2014and, correlatively, that of the arithmetical\nattitude\u2014is tied to the concrete genesis which must make it possible.\nFrom the start, Husserl refuses, and will always refuse, to accept the\nintelligibility and normativity of this universal structure as manna\nfallen from a \u201cheavenly place\u201d (topos ouranios),2 or as an eternal truth\ncreated by an in\ufb01nite reason. To seek out the subjective origin of\narithmetical objects and values, here, is to turn back toward perception,\ntoward perceptual ensembles, and toward the pluralities and totalities\nfound in perception in a premathematical organization. By virtue of its\nstyle this return to perception and to acts of colligation or numeration\nyields to the then frequent temptation vaguely named \u201cpsycholo-\ngism.\u201d3 But Husserl indicates his reservations on more than one score\nand he never reaches the point of construing an actual genetic constitu-\ntion as an epistemological validation, as Lipps, Wundt, and several\nothers had the tendency to do (although it is true that read attentively,\nand for themselves, they would appear more prudent and less simplistic\nthan one would be tempted to believe on the basis of Husserl\u2019s criti-\ncisms of them).\nHusserl\u2019s originality is to be recognized in that: (a) he distinguishes\nnumber from concept, that is, from a constructum, a psychological\nartifact; (b) he underlines that mathematical or logical synthesis is\nirreducible to the order\u2014in both senses of the word of psychological\ngenesis and structure 197\n"

It is the strange presence of\nthis Idea which also permits every transition to the limit and the pro-\nduction of all exactitude.\n2. Transcendental intentionality is described in Ideas I as an original\nstructure, an archi-structure (Ur-Struktur) with four poles and two cor-\nrelations: the noetico-noematic correlation or structure and the morphe-\nhyle correlation or structure. That this complex structure is the structure\nboth of intentionality, that is, the structure of the origin of meanings\nand of the opening to the light of phenomenality, and that the occlu-\nsion of this structure is non-sense itself, is indicated by at least two\nsigns: (A) Noesis and noema, the intentional moments of the structure,\ncan be distinguished in that the noema does not belong to conscious-\nness in a real way.

In any event, the transcendentality of the opening is\nsimultaneously the origin and the undoing, the condition of possibility\nand a certain impossibility of every structure and of every systematic\nstructuralism. (B) While the noema is an intentional and non-real\nelement, the hyle\u00af is a real but not intentional element of the experi-\nenced. It is the sensate (experienced and not real) material of a\ufb00ect\nbefore any animation by intentional form. It is the pole of pure passiv-\nity, of the nonintentionality without which consciousness could not\nreceive anything other than itself, nor exercise its intentional activity.\nThis receptiveness is also an essential opening. If, on the level at which\nIdeas remains, Husserl renounces the description and interrogation of\nthe hyle\u00af for itself and in its pure ingenuity, if he renounces the examin-\nation of the possibilities entitled formless materials and immaterial forms, 16 if\nhe keeps to the constituted hyle\u00af-morphic correlation, it is that his analyses\nare still developed (and will they not always be so, in a certain way?)\nfrom within a constituted temporality.17 Now, at its greatest depth and\nin its pure speci\ufb01city the hyle\u00af is primarily temporal matter.

It was all\nthe more tempting to think so in that Husserl himself prescribed the\nestablishment of a phenomenological psychology, an \u201capriorical\u201d\npsychology, to be sure, but also a worldly one (in that it cannot exclude\nthe position of the worldly thing that the psyche is), and strictly parallel to\ntranscendental phenomenology.

First, because in the most general fashion, phenomen-\nology cannot and may not ever describe anything but the intentional\nmodi\ufb01cations of the eidos ego in general.20 Next, because the genealogy\nof logic kept to the realm of cogitata and the acts of the ego as if to its\nproper existence and life; and these were read only on the basis of\nnoematic signs and results. Now however, as stated in the Cartesian\nMeditations, it is a question of returning once more to the couple cogito-\ncogitatum, if you will, in order to reapprehend the genesis of the ego\nitself, the ego existing for itself and \u201ccontinuously constituting [itself]\nas existing.\u201d21 Aside from the delicate problems of passivity and activity,\nthis genetic description of the ego will encounter limits which we\nwould be tempted to call de\ufb01nitive, but which Husserl, of course,\nconsiders provisional.
