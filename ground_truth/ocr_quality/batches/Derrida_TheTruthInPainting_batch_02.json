Heidegger does \nnot name it here, but he defends it elsewhere against Nietzsche's \nreading. What holds of speculative dialectic in general is made \nrigorously clear in the Lectures: an essential affinity with the \nCritique, the only book-third book-which it can reflect and \nreappropriate almost at once. The first two critiques of pure (spec\u00ad\nulative and practical) reason had opened an apparently infinite \ngulf. The third could, should, should have, could have thought it: \nthat is, filled it, fulfilled it in infinite reconciliation. \"Already the \nKantian philosophy not only felt the need for this junction-point \n( Vereinigungspunkt) but recognized it with precision and fur\u00ad\nnished a representation of it.\" The third Critique had the merit \nof identifying in art (in general) one of the middle terms (Mitten) \nfor resolving (auflosen) the \"opposition\" between mind and na\u00ad\nture, internal and external phenomena, the inside and the outside, \netc. But it still suffered, according to Hegel, from a lacuna, a \"lack\" \n(Mangel), it remained a theory of subjectivity and of judgment (an \nanalogous reservation of principle is expressed in The Origin). \nConfined, unilateral, the reconciliation is not yet effective. The \nLectures must supplement this lack, the structure of which has, \nas always, the form of a representative anticipation. The recon\u00ad\nciliation is only announced, represented in the third Critique in \nthe form of a duty, a Sollen projected to infinity. \nAnd so it indeed appears. \nOn the one hand, Kant declares that he \"neither wants nor \nis able\" (\u00a7 22) to examine whether \"common sense\" (here rein\u00ad\nterpreted as a nondetermined, nonconceptual, and nonintellectual \nnorm) exists as a constitutive principle of the possibility of aes\u00ad\nthetic experience or else whether, in a regulative capacity, reason \ncommands us to produce it (hervorbringen) for more elevated \npurposes. This common sense is constantly presupposed by the \nCritique, which nevertheless holds back the analysis of it. It could \nbe shown that this suspension ensures the complicity of a moral \ndiscourse and an empirical culturalism. This is a permanent \nnecessity. \nOn the other hand, recalling the division of philosophy and \nall the irreducible oppositions which the first two Critiques had \ndetermined, Kant does indeed project the plan of a work which \ncould reduce the \"enigma\" of aesthetic judgment and fill a crack, \na cleavage, an abyss (Kluft): \"If thus an abyss stretching out of \n"

The bottom. \nThe understanding and reason are not two disconnected fac\u00ad\nulties; they are articulated in a certain task and a certain number \nof operations which involve, precisely, articulation, i.e., discourse. \nFor between the two faculties, an articulated member, a third \nfaculty comes into play. This intermediary member which Kant \nnames precisely Mittelglied, middle articulation, is judgment ( Ur\u00ad\nteil). But what will be the nature of the a priori principles of the \nmiddle articulation? Will they be constitutive or regulative? Do \nthey give a priori rules to pleasure and unpleasure?

It does not involve any contradiction. The \nseparation of the part is not prescribed and forbidden from the \nsame point of view.

The phi\u00ad\nlosophy of art presupposes an art of philosophizing, a major art, \nbut also a miner's art in its critical preliminaries, an architect's \nart in its edifying erection. And if, as will be said further on, \nfine art is always an art of genius, then the Anthropology from \nthe Pragmatic Point of View would for preference delegate a \nGerman to the post of critique: the German genius shows itself \nbest on the side of the root, the Italian on that of the crown of \nleaves, the French on that of the flower and the English on that \nof the fruit. Finally, if this pure philosophy or fundamental meta\u00ad\nphysics here proposes to account for, among other things, desire, \npleasure and unpleasure, it exposes itself and represents itself \nfirst of all in its own desire. The desire of reason would be a \nfundamental desire, a desire for the fundamental, a desire to go \nto the bythos. Not an empirical desire since it leads toward the \nunconditioned, and that which yields itself up in the currency \nof a determinate metaphor ought, as a metaphor of reason, to \naccount for [rendre raison de] all other metaphors.

A theory of judgment as Mittelglied \nmust be constructed. But there will be \"great difficulties\" (grosse \nSchwierigkeiten) in finding for judgment a priori principles which \nare proper to it and which would protect the theory from empir\u00ad\nicism. One can find a priori concepts only in the understanding. \nThe faculty of judgment uses them, it applies them, but it does \nnot have at its disposal any concepts which belong to it or are \nspecifically reserved for it.

Noth\u00ad\ning, up to this point, suggested that it should be a question of \nthese. And now here is Kant declaring that this \"great difficulty\" \nof principle (subjective or objective), \"is found\" (tindet sich), that \nit is met with \"principally\" (hauptsdchlich) in the judgments \n\"which are called aesthetic.\" These could have constituted an \nexample, however important, a major occurrence of the \"diffi\u00ad\nculty.\" But in truth it is the principal example, the unique spec\u00ad\nimen which gives meaning and orients the multiplicity.

This critique of taste does not \nconcern production; it has in view neither \"education\" nor \"cul\u00ad\nture,\" which can very well do without it. And as the Critique will \nshow that one cannot assign conceptual rules to the beautiful, it \nwill not be a question of constituting an aesthetic, even a general \none, but of analyzing the formal conditions of possibility of an \naesthetic judgment in general, hence of an aesthetic objectivity \nin general. \nWith this transcendental aim, Kant demands to be read with\u00ad\nout indulgence. But for the rest, he admits the lacks, the lacunary \ncharacter (Mangelhaftigkeit) of his work. This is the word Hegel \nuses too. \nWhat does the lack depend on?

The distinction between re\u00ad\nflective and determinant judgment, a distinction that is both \nfamiliar and obscure, watches over all the internal divisions of \nthe book. I recall it in its poorest generality. The faculty of \njudgment in general allows one to think the particular as con\u00ad\ntained under the general (rule, principle, law). When the gen\u00ad\nerality is given first, the operation of judgment subsumes and \ndetermines the particular. It is determinant (bestimmend), it \nspecifies, narrows down, comprehends, tightens. In the contrary \nhypothesis, the reflective judgment (reflectirend) has only the \nparticular at its disposal and must climb back up to, return \ntoward generality: the example (this is what matters to us here) \nis here given prior to the law and, in its very uniqueness as \nexample, allows one to discover that law.

It contests neither the possibility nor \nthe reality of the objects of these ideas but it cannot admit them \ninto its maxims for thought and action.

The parergon inscribes something which comes \nas an extra, exterior to the proper field (here that of pure reason \nand of Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone) but whose \ntranscendent exteriority comes to play, abut onto, brush against, \nrub, press against the limit itself and intervene in the inside only \nto the extent that the inside is lacking. It is lacking in something \nand it is lacking from itself. Because reason is \"conscious of its \nimpotence to satisfy its moral need,\" it has recourse to the par\u00ad\nergon, to grace, to mystery, to miracles. It needs the supplemen\u00ad\ntary work. This additive, to be sure, is threatening. Its use is \ncritical. It involves a risk and exacts a price the theory of which \nis elaborated. To each parergon of Religion there is a corresponding \ndamage, a detriment (Nachteil) and the four classes of dangers \nwill correspond to the four types of parergon: ( I) for the would\u00ad\nbe internal experience (effects of grace), there is fanaticism; (2) \nfor the would-be external experience (miracles), there is super\u00ad\nstition; (3) for the would-be insight of the understanding into the \nsupernatural order there is illuminism; (4) for the would-be ac\u00ad\ntions on the supernatural (means of grace), there is thaumaturgy. \nThese four aberrations or seductions of reason nevertheless also \nhave in view a certain pleasing, pleasing-God (gottgefalliger \nAbsicht). \n"

Where does the criterion, the critical organ, \nthe organum of discernment come from here? It is no less obscure \nthan in the previous case. It even presents an extra difficulty: the \nparergon is added this time to a work which does not represent \nanything and which is itself already added to nature. We think \nwe know what properly belongs or does not belong to the human \nbody, what is detached or not detached from it-even though the \nparergon is precisely an ill-detachable detachment. But in a work \nof architecture, the Vorstellung, the representation is not struc\u00ad\nturally representational or else is so only through detours com\u00ad\nplicated enough, no doubt, to disconcert anyone who tried to \ndiscern, in a critical manner, the inside from the outside, the \nintegral part and the detachable part. So as not to add to these \ncomplications, I shall leave to one side, provisionally, the case of \ncolumns in the form of the human body, those that support or \nrepresent the support of a window (and does a window form part \nof the inside of a building or not? And what about the window \nof a building in a painting? ), and which can be naked or clothed, \ncan represent a man or a woman, a distinction to which Kant \nmakes no reference. \nWith this example of the columns is announced the whole \nproblematic of inscription in a milieu, of the marking out of the \nwork in a field of which it is always difficult to decide if it is \nnatural or artificial and, in this latter case, if it is parergon or \nergon. For not every milieu, even if it is contiguous with the work, \nconstitutes a parergon in the Kantian sense. The natural site cho\u00ad\nsen for the erection of a temple is obviously not a parergon. Nor \nis an artificial site: neither the crossroads, nor the church, nor \nthe museum, nor the other works around one or other. But the \ngarment or the column is. Why? It is not because they are detached \nbut on the contrary because they are more difficult to detach and \nabove all because without them, without their quasi-detachment, \nthe lack on the inside of the work would appear; or (which amounts \nto the same thing for a lack) would not appear. What constitutes \nthem as parerga is not simply their exteriority as a surplus, it is \nthe internal structural link which rivets them to the lack in the \ninterior of the ergon. And this lack would be constitutive of the \nvery unity of the ergon. Without this lack, the ergon would have \n"

At the limit between work and \nabsence of work, it divides in two. And this division gives rise to \na sort of pathology of the parergon, the forms of which must be \nnamed and classified, just as Religion recognized four types of \nparergonal misdeeds or detriments. Kant is in the process of de\u00ad\ntermining lithe proper object of the pure judgment of taste.\" But \nhe does not simply exclude from it the parergon as such and in \ngeneral. Only in certain conditions. The criterion of exclusion is \nhere a formality. \nWhat must we understand by formality? \nThe parergon ( frame, garment, column) can augment the plea\u00ad\nsure of taste ( Wohlgefallen des Geschmacks), contribute to the \nproper and intrinsically aesthetic representation if it intervenes \nby its form (durch seine Form) and only by its form. If it has a \n\"beautiful form,\" it forms part of the judgment of taste properly \nspeaking or in any case intervenes directly in it. This is, if you \nlike, the normal parergon. But if on the other hand it is not beau\u00ad\ntiful, purely beautiful, i.e., of a formal beauty, it lapses into adorn\u00ad\nment (Schmuck) and harms the beauty of the work, it does it \nwrong and causes it detriment (Abbruch). This is analogous to \nthe detriment or damage (Nachteil) of Religion. \nN ow the example of this degradation of the simple parergon \ninto a seductive adornment is again a frame, this time the gilded \nframe (goldene Rahmen), the gilding of the frame done in order \nto recommend the painting to our attention by its attraction (Reiz). \nWhat is bad, external to the pure object of taste, is thus what \nseduces by an attraction; and the example of what leads astray \nby its force of attraction is a color, the gilding, in as much as it \nis nonform, content, or sensory matter. The deterioration of the \nparergon, the perversion, the adornment, is the attraction of sen\u00ad\nsory matter. As design, organization of lines, forming of angles, \nthe frame is not at all an adornment and one cannot do without \nit. But in its purity, it ought to remain colorless, deprived of all \nempirical sensory materiality. \nThis opposition form/matter governs, as we know, the whole \nCritique and inscribes it within a powerful tradition. According \nto The Origin of the Work of Art, it is one of the three determi\u00ad\nnations (hypokeimenonlsymbebekos; aisthetonlnoeton, eidos\u00ad\nmorphelhyle) which fall violently upon the thing.
