Already in the First Manifesto:\nthe language of the stage: It is not a question of suppressing the\nspoken language, but of giving words approximately the importance\nthey have in dreams. Meanwhile new means of recording this lan-\nguage must be found, whether these means belong to musical tran-\nscription or to some kind of code. As for ordinary objects, or even the\nhuman body, raised to the dignity of signs, it is evident that one can\ndraw one\u2019s inspiration from hieroglyphic characters [TD, p. 94] . . .\nEternal laws, those of all poetry and all viable language, and, among\nother things, of Chinese ideograms and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.\nHence, far from restricting the possibilities of theater and language,\non the pretext that I will not perform written plays, I extend the lan-\nguage of the stage and multiply its possibilities [TD, p. 111].\nAs concerns psychoanalysis and especially psychoanalysts, Artaud was\nno less careful to indicate his distance from those who believe that they\ncan retain discourse with the aid of psychoanalysis, and thereby can\nwield its initiative and powers of initiation.\nFor the theater of cruelty is indeed a theater of dreams, but of cruel\ndreams, that is to say, absolutely necessary and determined dreams,\ndreams calculated and given direction, as opposed to what Artaud\nbelieved to be the empirical disorder of spontaneous dreams. The ways\nand \ufb01gures of dreams can be mastered. The surrealists read Hervey de\nSaint-Denys.8 In this theatrical treatment of dreams, \u201cpoetry and sci-\nence must henceforth be identical\u201d (TD, p. 140). To make them such, it\nis certainly necessary to proceed according to the modern magic that is\npsychoanalysis. \u201cI propose to bring back into the theater this elem-\nentary magic idea, taken up by modern psychoanalysis\u201d (TD, p. 80). But\nno concession must be made to what Artaud believes to be the faltering\nof dreams and of the unconscious. It is the law of dreams that must be\nproduced or reproduced: \u201cI propose to renounce our empiricism of\nimagery, in which the unconscious furnishes images at random, and\nwhich the poet arranges at random too\u201d (ibid.).\nBecause he wants \u201cto see sparkle and triumph on stage\u201d \u201cwhatever is\nthe theater of cruelty 305\n"

He would have\nrejected a psychoanalytic theater with as much rigor as he condemned\npsychological theater. And for the same reasons: his rejection of any\nsecret interiority, of the reader, of directive interpretations or of psy-\nchodramaturgy. \u201cThe subconscious will not play any true rule on stage.\nWe\u2019ve had enough of the confusion engendered between author and\naudience through the medium of producers and actors. Too bad for\nanalysts, students of the soul and surrealists. . . . We are determined to\nsafeguard the plays we put on against any secret commentary\u201d (CW\n2:39).9 By virtue of his situation and his status, the psychoanalyst\nwould belong to the structure of the classical stage, to its societal form,\nits metaphysics, its religion, etc.\nThe theater of cruelty thus would not be a theater of the\nunconscious. Almost the contrary. Cruelty is consciousness, is exposed\nlucidity. \u201cThere is no cruelty without consciousness and without the\napplication of consciousness\u201d (TD, p. 102). And this consciousness\nindeed lives upon a murder, is the consciousness of this murder, as we\nsuggested above. Artaud says this in \u201cThe First Letter on Cruelty\u201d: \u201cIt is\nconsciousness that gives to the exercise of every act of life its blood-red\ncolor, its cruel nuance, since it is understood that life is always\nsomeone\u2019s death\u201d (TD, p. 102).\nPerhaps Artaud is also protesting against a certain Freudian descrip-\ntion of dreams as the substitutive ful\ufb01llment of desire, as the function\nof vicariousness: through the theater, Artaud wants to return their\ndignity to dreams and to make of them something more original, more\nfree, more a\ufb03rmative than an activity of displacement. It is perhaps\nagainst a certain image of Freudian thought that he writes in the First\nManifesto: \u201cTo consider the theater as a second-hand psychological or\nmoral function, and to believe that dreams themselves have only a\nsubstitute function, is to diminish the profound poetic bearing of\ndreams as well as of the theater\u201d (TD, p. 92).\nFinally, a psychoanalytic theater would risk being a desacralizing\ntheater, and thereby would con\ufb01rm the West in its project and its\ntrajectory. The theater of cruelty is a hieratic theater. Regression toward\nthe unconscious (cf. TD, p. 47) fails if it does not reawaken the sacred, if\nwriting and difference\n306\n"

Now, for Artaud, the festival\nof cruelty could take place only one time: \u201cLet us leave textual criti-\ncism to graduate students, formal criticism to esthetes, and recognize\nthat what has been said is not still to be said; that an expression does\nnot have the same value twice, does not live two lives; that all words,\nonce spoken, are dead and function only at the moment when they\nare uttered, that a form, once it has served, cannot be used again and\nasks only to be replaced by another, and that the theater is the only\nplace in the world where a gesture, once made, can never be made\nthe same way twice\u201d (TD, p. 75). This is indeed how things appear:\ntheatrical representation is \ufb01nite, and leaves behind it, behind its\nactual presence, no trace, no object to carry o\ufb00. It is neither a book\nnor a work, but an energy, and in this sense it is the only art of life.\n\u201cThe theater teaches precisely the uselessness of the action which,\nonce done, is not to be done, and the superior use of the state\nunused by the action and which, restored, produces a puri\ufb01cation\u201d\n(TD, p. 82).

Here, one must practice the\naktive Vergesslichkeit which is spoken of in the second dissertation of The\nGenealogy of Morals, which also explicates \u201cfestivity\u201d and \u201ccruelty\u201d\n(Grausamkeit).\nArtaud\u2019s disgust with nontheatrical writing has the same sense.\nWhat inspires this disgust is not, as in the Phaedrus, the gesture of the\nbody, the sensory and mnemonic, the hypomnesiac mark exterior to\nthe inscription of truth in the soul, but, on the contrary, writing as the\nsite of the inscription of truth, the other of the living body, writing as\nideality, repetition. Plato criticizes writing as a body; Artaud criticizes it\nas the erasure of the body, of the living gesture which takes place only\nonce. Writing is space itself and the possibility of repetition in general.\nThis is why \u201cWe should get rid of our superstitious valuation of texts\nand written poetry.

Another concept of life had been\nsurreptitiously put in its place, to remain there, never to be exceeded,\nany more than reason is ever exceeded (for, says L\u2019erotisme, \u201cby de\ufb01n-\nition, the excess is outside reason\u201d). This life is not natural life, the\nbiological existence put at stake in lordship, but an essential life that is\nwelded to the \ufb01rst one, holding it back, making it work for the consti-\ntution of self-consciousness, truth, and meaning. Such is the truth of\nlife. Through this recourse to the Aufhebung, which conserves the stakes,\nremains in control of the play, limiting it and elaborating it by giving it\nform and meaning (Die Arbeit . . . bildet), this economy of life restricts\nitself to conservation, to circulation and self-reproduction as the repro-\nduction of meaning; henceforth, everything covered by the name lord-\nship collapses into comedy. The independence of self-consciousness10\nbecomes laughable at the moment when it liberates itself by enslaving\nitself, when it starts to work, that is, when it enters into dialectics.\nLaughter alone exceeds dialectics and the dialectician: it bursts out only\non the basis of an absolute renunciation of meaning, an absolute risk-\ning of death, what Hegel calls abstract negativity. A negativity that\nnever takes place, that never presents itself, because in doing so it would\nstart to work again. A laughter that literally never appears, because it\nexceeds phenomenality in general, the absolute possibility of meaning.\nAnd the word \u201claughter\u201d itself must be read in a burst, as its nucleus of\nmeaning bursts in the direction of the system of the sovereign operation\n(\u201cdrunkenness, erotic e\ufb00usion, sacri\ufb01cial e\ufb00usion, poetic e\ufb00usion,\nheroic behavior, anger, absurdity,\u201d etc., cf.

Sovereignty, as we shall verify, is more and less than lordship, more\nor less free than it, for example; and what we are saying about the\npredicate \u201cfreedom\u201d can be extended to every characteristic of lord-\nship.

It would\nfail for having wanted to be victorious, and for having alleged that it\nkept the upper hand.

Or rather, discerns two forms of writing. It forbids the\nform that projects the trace, and through which, as the writing of lord-\nship, the will seeks to maintain itself within the trace, seeks to be\nrecognized within it and to reconstitute the presence of itself. This is\nservile writing as well; Bataille, therefore, scorned it. But this scorned\nservility of writing is not the servility condemned by tradition since\nPlato.

(\u201cI introduce unten-\nable concepts,\u201d Le petit). The philosopher is blind to Bataille\u2019s text\nbecause he is a philosopher only through the desire to hold on to, to\nmaintain his certainty of himself and the security of the concept as\nsecurity against this sliding. For him, Bataille\u2019s text is full of traps: it is,\nin the initial sense of the word, a scandal.\nThe transgression of meaning is not an access to the immediate and\nindeterminate identity of a nonmeaning, nor is it an access to the possi-\nbility of maintaining nonmeaning. Rather, we would have to speak of\nan epoche\u00af of the epoch of meaning, of a\u2014written\u2014putting between\nbrackets that suspends the epoch of meaning: the opposite of a phe-\nnomenological epoche\u00af, for this latter is carried out in the name and in sight of\nmeaning. The phenomenological epoche\u00af is a reduction that pushes us\nback toward meaning. Sovereign transgression is a reduction of this\nreduction: not a reduction to meaning, but a reduction of meaning.\nThus, while exceeding the Phenomenology of the Mind, this transgression at\nthe same time exceeds phenomenology in general, in its most modern\ndevelopments (cf. EI, p. 19).\nWill this new writing depend upon the agency of sovereignty? Will it\nobey the imperatives of sovereignty? Will it subordinate itself to that\nwhich subordinates nothing? (And does so, one might say, by essence,\nif sovereignty had an essence.) The answer is, not at all; and this is the\nunique paradox of the relation between discourse and sovereignty. To\nrelate the major form of writing to the sovereign operation is to insti-\ntute a relation in the form of a nonrelation, to inscribe rupture in the\ntext, to place the chain of discursive knowledge in relation to an\nunknowledge which is not a moment of knowledge: an absolute\nunknowledge from whose nonbasis is launched chance, or the wagers\nfrom restricted to general economy 339\n"
