The continuous transition of his metaphysics of life into his\ntheory of Language, and his critique of the word, dictated a great\nnumber of theoretical formulations and metaphors of energy that are\nrigorously Bergsonian. Cf., in particular, OC 5:15, 18, 56, 132, 141, etc.\n20. Each time that it operates within the framework that we are attempting\nto restore here, Artaud\u2019s language has a precise resemblance, in its\nsyntax and vocabulary, to that of the young Marx. In the \ufb01rst of the\nEconomic and Political Manuscripts of 1844, the labor which produces\nthe work and gives it value (Verwertung) proportionately increases the\nde-preciation (Entwertung) of its author. \u201cLabor\u2019s realization is its\nobjecti\ufb01cation. In the sphere of political economy this realization of\nlabor appears as loss of realization for the workers; objecti\ufb01cation as\nloss of the object and bondage to it; appropriation as estrangement, as\nalienation\u201d (Karl Marx, Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,\ntrans. Martin Milligan [New York: International Publishers, 1964],\np. 41. This juxtaposition escapes the realms of intellectual puttering\nor of historical curiosity. Its necessity will appear later when the ques-\ntion of what belongs to that which we call the metaphysics of the\nproper (or of alienation) is posed.\n21. It goes without saying that we have deliberately abstained from any-\nthing that could be called a \u201cbiographical reference.\u201d If it is precisely at\nthis point that we recall that Artaud died of cancer of the rectum, we\ndo not do so in order to have the exception prove the rule, but because\nwe think that the status (still to be found) of this remark, and of other\nsimilar ones, must not be that of the so-called \u201cbiographical refer-\nence.\u201d The new status\u2014to be found\u2014is that of the relations between\nexistence and the text, between these two forms of textuality and the\ngeneralized writing within whose play they are articulated.\n22. In the Preface to his Collected Works, Artaud writes: \u201cThe cane of \u2018The\nNew Revelations of Being\u2019 fell into the black cyst along with the little\nsword. I have got another cane ready to accompany my collected\nworks in hand to hand combat, not with ideas, but with those monkeys\nwho never stop riding them to death from one end of my conscious\nself to the other, as well as through my organism they have blighted . . .\nMy cane will be this furious book called forth by ancient peoples now\ndead, spotted throughout my nervous \ufb01bres like daughters shed.\u201d CW\n1:21.\n23.

Let us acknowledge that Artaud is the \ufb01rst to attempt to reassemble,\non a martyrological tree, the vast family of madmen of genius. He\ndoes so in Van Gogh, le suicid\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (1947), one of the rare texts\nin which Nietzsche is named, among other \u201csuicides\u201d (Baudelaire,\nPoe, Nerval, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, H\u00f6lderlin, Coleridge). Artaud\nwrites further on: \u201cNo, Socrates did not have this eye; perhaps the only\none before Van Gogh was the unhappy Nietzsche who had the same\npower to undress the soul, to pluck the body from the soul, to lay the\nbody of man bare, beyond the subterfuges of the mind\u201d (AA, p. 160).\n27.

Which means that God did not die at a given moment of\nhistory, but that God is Dead because he is the name of Death itself,\nthe name of the death within me and the name of that which, having\nstolen me from my birth, has penetrated my life. As God-Death is differ-\nence within life, he has never ceased to die, that is to say, to live. \u201cFor\neven the in\ufb01nite is dead/in\ufb01nite is the name of a dead man, who is not\ndead\u201d (ibid.). Only life without difference, life without death will van-\nquish death and God. But it will do so by negating itself as life, within\ndeath, and by becoming God himself.

And here, as in The Theater and Its Double, the place of the text\nis recognized as that of usurped mastery and as the proper, nonmeta-\nphorical, practice of slavery. To have the text at one\u2019s disposition is to\nbe a master. \u201cOpera is the birth of the theoretical man, of the critical\nlayman, not of the artist: one of the most surprising facts in the whole\nhistory of art. It was the demand of thoroughly unmusical hearers that\nthe words must above all be understood, so that according to them a\nre-birth of music is only to be expected when some mode of singing\nhas been discovered in which the text-word lords over the counter-\npoint as the master over the servant\u201d (Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of\nTragedy, trans. William A. Houssman [New York: Russell and Russell,\n1964], p. 145).

Maximilian A. Mugge [New York: Russell and Russell, 1964],\np. 31), and \u00e0 propos of the \u201chieroglyphic\u201d relation between the text of a\npoem and music (ibid., p. 37), the musical illustration of the poem and\nthe project of imparting to music an intelligible language (\u201cWhat a\nperverted world! A task that appears to my mind like that of a son\nwanting to create his father!\u201d ibid. p. 33)\u2014numerous formulations\nannounce Artaud. But here it is music, as elsewhere dance, that\nNietzsche wants to liberate from the text and from recitation. Doubt-\nless, an abstract liberation in Artaud\u2019s eyes. Only the theater, the total\nart including and utilizing music and dance among other forms of\nlanguage, can accomplish this liberation. It must be noted that if\nArtaud, like Nietzsche, often supports dance, he never abstracts it\nfrom the theater. If one heedlessly takes dance literally, and not, as we\nsaid above, in an analogical sense, it would not be the entirety of\ntheater. Artaud, perhaps, would not say, as Nietzsche did, \u201cI can only\nbelieve in a God who would dance.\u201d Not only because God could not\ndance, as Nietzsche knew, but because dance alone is an impover-\nished theater. This speci\ufb01cation was even more necessary in that Zar-\nathustra condemns poets and poetic works as the alienation of the\nbody into metaphor. On Poets begins thus.: \u201c \u2018 Since I have known the\nbody better,\u2019 said Zarathustra to one of his disciples\u2014\u2018the spirit hath\nonly been to me symbolically spirit; and all that is \u2018imperishable\u2019\u2014\nThat is also but a simile.\u2019 \u2018So have I heard thee say once before,\u2019\nanswered the disciple \u2018and then thou addedst: \u201cBut the poets lie too\nmuch.\u201d Why didst thou say that the poets lie too much?\u2019 . . . \u2018And fain\nnotes to page 233 423\n"

Phonologism is Derrida\u2019s abbreviated fashion of describing one of\nthe metaphysical gestures inherent in most linguistics: the privilege\ngiven to a model of language based on speech, because speech is the\nmost present form of language, is presence in language. This is equiva-\nlent to the metaphysical repression of writing, i.e., of difference. Here,\ntoo, Derrida might be challenging Jacques Lacan, whose statement\nabout the unconscious being structured like a language seems to\ndepend upon many of the linguistic conceptions which Derrida con-\nsiders to be uncritically metaphysical.\n2. TN. \u201cBreaching\u201d is the translation we have adopted for the German\nword Bahnung. Bahnung is derived from Bahn, road, and literally\nmeans pathbreaking. Derrida\u2019s translation of Bahnung is frayage,\nwhich has an idiomatic connection to pathbreaking in the expression,\nse frayer un chemin. \u201cBreaching\u201d is clumsy, but it is crucial to maintain\nthe sense of the force that breaks open a pathway, and the space\nopened by this force; thus, \u201cbreaching\u201d must be understood here as a\nshorthand for these meanings. In the Standard Edition Bahnung has\nbeen translated as \u201cfacilitation,\u201d and we have, of course, maintained\nthis in all citations from the Standard Edition. Citations from The\nStandard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud,\nLondon: Hogarth Press (abbreviated as SE) are by volume and page\nnumber.\n3. TN.

Freud insists above all on\nthe role of verbal representations: \u201cIt is very noteworthy how little the\ndream-work keeps to the word-presentations; it is always ready to\nexchange one word for another till it \ufb01nds the expression most handy\nfor plastic representation\u201d (XIV, 228). This passage is followed by a\ncomparison, from the point of view of word-representations and thing-\nrepresentations, of the dreamer\u2019s language and the language of the\nschizophrenic.

He seems to be referring, if rather elliptically, to the Hegelian\ndialectic of the master and the slave, in which the master, who both\nrisks death and consumes with pleasure, does not maintain the present.\nThe slave is the truth of the master because he maintains the present\nthrough his relation to work, his deferred consumption of the present.\nThus he is also the embodiment of the dialectical \u201cmemory\u201d\u2014\nErinnerung.

One escapes from it, apparently, only by\nconceiving difference outside the determination of Being as presence,\noutside the alternatives of presence and absence and everything they\ngovern, and only by conceiving difference as original impurity, that is\nto say as diff\u00e9rance in the \ufb01nite economy of the same.\n21.

Let us note here and now that at least\nfor Bataille there was no fundamental rupture between Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s read-\ning of Hegel, to which he openly subscribed almost totally, and the\ntrue instruction of Marxism. In a bibliography which was to accom-\npany an unpublished Th\u00e9orie de la religion, one can read this in particu-\nlar: \u201cThis work (Introduction to the Reading of Hegel by Koj\u00e8ve) is an\nexplication of The Phenomenology of the Mind. The ideas that I have\ndeveloped are all here in substance.

In the Phenomenology of\nthe Mind, pursuing this dialectic of the master (the lord, the sovereign)\nand the slave (the man subjugated to work), which is at the origin of\nthe Communist theory of class struggle, Hegel brings the slave to\ntriumph, but his apparent sovereignty is then only the autonomous\nwill of servitude; for its part, sovereignty has only the kingdom of\nfailure\u201d (Genet, in La litt\u00e9rature et le mal).\n25. TN. Erinnerung is the Hegelian, speculative concept of interiorizing\nmemory. Like Aufhebung (cf. note 13 above) it leaves nothing behind.\nRecognition is the Hegelian category which governs the dialectic of\nmaster and slave: it is the master\u2019s \ufb01nal recognition of his truth in the\nslave that permits the Aufhebung, the master\u2019s interiorizing of the\nslave, which produces the freedom of self-consciousness.

Thus, a page further on: \u201cAnd it does not\neven suf\ufb01ce to say: one cannot speak of the sovereign moment with-\nout altering it, without altering it insofar as it is truly sovereign. To the\nsame extent as to speak of it, to seek these movements is contradict-\nory. At the moment when we seek something, whatever it is, we do not\nlive in sovereign fashion, we subordinate the present moment to a\nfuture moment that will follow it. Perhaps we attain the sovereign\nmoment following our effort, and, in effect, it is possible that an effort\nis necessary, but between the time of the effort and sovereign time\nthere is necessarily a cut-off, and, one could even say, an abyss.\u201d\nnotes to pages 333\u201338\n438\n"

Sartre\u2019s study, cited above, joints its \ufb01rst and second parts with the\nhinge of this proposition: \u201cBut form is not everything: let us look at the\ncontent\u201d (Situations I, p. 142).\n29. \u201cA dislodging, but aware use of words,\u201d says Sollers (\u201cDe grandes\nirr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s de langage,\u201d Critique, 195\u201396).\n30. One of the essential themes of Sartre\u2019s study (Un nouveau mystique) is\nalso the accusation of scientism, joined with that of mysticism. (\u201cSci-\nentism also will falsify M. Bataille\u2019s entire thought,\u201d p. 147).\n31. Unknowledge is historical, as Sartre notes (\u201cUnknowledge is essen-\ntially historical, since it can be designated only as a certain experience\nthat a certain man had at a certain date,\u201d p. 140), only on its dis-\ncursive, economical, subordinated side, which can be seen and, more\nprecisely, can be designated only within the reassuring closure of know-\nledge. The \u201cedifying narrative\u201d\u2014this is how Sartre quali\ufb01es interior\nexperience immediately afterward\u2014is, on the contrary, on the side of\nknowledge, history, and meaning.\n32. On the operation which consists in miming absolute knowledge, at\nwhose termination \u201cunknowledge having been attained, absolute\nknowledge becomes one kind of knowledge among others,\u201d cf. pp.\n73ff. and 138ff. of EI, where important developments are devoted to the\nCartesian model (\u201ca solid base on which everything rests\u201d) and the\nHegelian model (\u201ccircularity\u201d) of knowledge.\n33. One would commit a gross error in interpreting these propositions in\na \u201creactionary\u201d sense. The consumption of the excess of energy by a\ndetermined class is not the destructive consuming of meaning, but\nthe signi\ufb01cative reappropriation of a surplus value within the space of\nrestricted economy. From this point of view, sovereignty is absolutely\nrevolutionary. But it is also revolutionary as concerns a revolution\nwhich would only reorganize the world of work and would redistribute\nvalues within the space of meaning, that is to say, still within restricted\neconomy. This last movement\u2014only slightly perceived, here and\nthere, by Bataille (for example, in La part maudite. when he evokes the\n\u201cradicalism of Marx\u201d and the \u201crevolutionary sense that Marx formu-\nlated in a sovereign way\u201d) and most often muddled by conjectural\napproximations (for example in the \ufb01fth part of La part maudite)\u2014is\nrigorously necessary, but as a phase within the strategy of general\neconomy.\n34. The writing of sovereignty is neither true nor false, neither truthful nor\ninsincere. It is purely \ufb01ctive in a sense of this word that the classical\noppositions of true and false, essence and appearance, lack. It\nnotes to pages 338\u201342 439\n"

      "full_text": " \n\u201cthe exercise of power\u201d (subjugating lordship), Bataille opposes \u201cthe\nclassic idea of sovereignty,\u201d which \u201cis linked to the idea of command\u201d\nand consequently wields all the attributes which are refused, under the\nsame word, to the sovereign operation (free, victorious, self-conscious,\nacknowledged, etc., subjectivity, which is therefore mediated and\nturned away from itself, returning to itself for having been turned away\nfrom itself by the work of the slave). Now, Bataille demonstrates that\nthe \u201cmajor positions\u201d of sovereignty, as much as the minor ones, can\nbe inserted into the sphere of activity\u201d (M\u00e9thode).\nThe difference between the major and the minor is therefore only\nanalogous to the difference between the archaic and the classic. And\nneither the one nor the other must be understood in a classic or minor\nfashion. The archaic is not the originary or the authentic, as they are\ndetermined by philosophical discourse. The major is not opposed to\nthe minor like big to little, high to low. In \u201cVieille taupe\u201d (Old Mole),\n(an unpublished article, rejected by Bifurs), the oppositions of high to\nlow, and of all the signi\ufb01cations in sur-, super- (surreal, superman) and\nin sub- (subterranean, etc.), of the imperialist eagle and the proletarian\nmole, are examined in all the possibilities of their reversals.\n40. \u201cPlay is nothing if not an open and unreserved challenge to everything\nopposed to play\u201d (marginal note in the unpublished \u201cTh\u00e9orie de la\nreligion,\u201d which Bataille also planned to entitle \u201cTo die laughing and to\nlaugh at dying\u201d).\n41. \u201cA gesture . . . irreducible to classical logic . . . and for which no logic\nseems to be constituted\u201d says Sollers in Le toit, which begins by\nunmasking, in their systematicity, all the forms of pseudotransgression,\nthe social and historical \ufb01gurations in which can be read the complicity\nbetween \u201cthe man who lives without protest under the yoke of the law,\nand the man for whom the law is nothing.\u201d In this last case, repression\nis only \u201credoubled\u201d (Le toit: Essai de lecture syst\u00e9matique, in Logiques\n[Paris: Seuil, 1968], p. 168).\n42. Like every discourse, like Hegel\u2019s, Bataille\u2019s discourse has the form of\na structure of interpretations. Each proposition, which is already\ninterpretive in nature, can be interpreted by another proposition.\nTherefore, if we proceed prudently and all the while remain in Bataille\u2019s\ntext, we can detach an interpretation from its reinterpretation and\nsubmit it to another interpretation bound to other propositions of the\nsystem. Which, without interrupting general systematicity, amounts to\nrecognizing the strong and weak moments in the interpretation of a\nbody of thought by itself, these differences of force keeping to the\nnotes to pages 345\u201348 441\n"

Which nei-\nther frees nor prohibits us from determining the rules of force and of\nweakness: which are always a function of: (1) the distance from the\nmoment of sovereignty; (2) the misconstruing of the rigorous norms\nof knowledge.\nThe greatest force is the force of a writing which, in the most\naudacious transgression, continues to maintain and to acknowledge\nthe necessity of the system of prohibitions (knowledge, science, phil-\nosophy, work, history, etc.). Writing is always traced between these two\nsides of the limit.\nAmong the weak moments of Bataille\u2019s discourse, certain ones are\nsignaled by the determined unknowledge which is a certain philo-\nsophical ignorance.

Drawing attention to this\npoint in order to illuminate Bataille\u2019s text and context, we doubt nei-\nther the historic necessity of this risk, nor the function of awakening\nwhose price it was, within a conjuncture that is no longer ours. All this\nmerits recognition. Awakening and time have been necessary.\n43. TN. Sens, in French, means both sense and direction.
