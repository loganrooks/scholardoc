In parergonal fashion, of course, as an outside \nassigned in the inside and yet irreducible. \n- What, for example? \n- Well, if, along with the frame and the column, clothing \nis for Kant an example of a parergon, in its aesthetic represen\u00ad\ntation, and if then what is proper to representation is the \"nude,\" \nthen where shall we classify certain \"old shoes with laces\"? Do \nthey not have as their \"principal\" subject this time the parergon, \nall by itself, with all the consequences that follow from that? \nA parergon without ergon\u00ad A \"pure\" supplement? An article of \nclothing as a \"naked\" supplement to the \"naked\"? A supplement \nwith nothing to supplement, calling, on the contrary, for what \nit supplements, to be its own supplement? How would the shoes \nrelate to the \"naked\" thing, to the \"nude\" and the \"remainder\" \nwe've just been talking about? And yet, in another sense, we \njust said that they were \"naked,\" we saw them quite naked. Is \nit by chance that the vestimentary \"metaphor\" comes so easily \nto Heidegger, when he wants to speak of the thing \"pure and \nsimple\"? \"This 'naked' (bloss) does however mean the stripping \n(Entblossung) of the character of usefulness (Dienlichkeit) and \nof being made. The naked thing (blosse Ding) is a sort of product \n(Zeug) but a product divested (entkleidete) of its being-as-prod\u00ad\nuct. Being-thing then consists in what still remains. But this \nremainder (Rest) is not properly determined in itself. It remains \ndoubtful (Es bleibt fraglich) whether it is along the road (auf \ndem Wege) of a subtraction of all product-like characteristics \n(alles Zeughaften) that the being-thing of the thing comes in \ngeneral to appear.\" A subtraction (of the being-product) will not \nrestitute the \"remainder\" to us as a \"naked\" thing. The re\u00ad\nmainder is not a naked thing. We have to \"think\" the remainder \notherwise. \n"

It is also because they are painted: within the \nlimits of a picture, but limits that have to be thought in laces. \nHors-d'oeuvre in the oeuvre, hors-d'oeuvre as oeuvre: the laces \ngo through the eyelets (which also go in pairs) and pass on to the \ninvisible side.

Heidegger designates in this way the \n( female) wearer of the shoes outside the picture, if one can put \nit that way, when the lace of discourse passes outside the edging \nof the frame, into that hors-d'oeuvre which he claims to see \npresenting itself in the work itself. But each time he speaks of \nthe exemplary product in the picture, he says, in neutral, generic \nfashion-that is, according to a grammar, masculine fashion: \n\"ein Paar Bauernschuhe,\" a pair of peasants' shoes. Why are \nthe feet of the thing, in this case of some shoes, then posited \nas the feet of a woman, a peasant woman? The induction of a \ngesture such as this is all the more overdetermined because of \nthe fact that in these passages the painting is no longer what \nlays down the law. This induction was without a doubt aided \nby so many other \"peasant women\" by Van Gogh, which is a \nstep on the way to the contamination incriminated by Schapiro. \nAccording to him, several pictures came to make up Heidegger's \nimaginary model. We shall have to reexamine this complaint \nlater. Elsewhere I shall also suggest placing in series, in a gallery, \nall the figures of women which rhythm, with their discreet, \nfurtive, almost unnoticed appearances, Heidegger's discourse on \nThe Thing: the peasant woman, the Thracian servant girl, the \nwoman museum attendant, the \"young girl\" as \"too young a \nthing\" in the saying quoted at the beginning of our chapter and \nmet with, like the first examples, on the road, am Weg: \"Der \nStein am Weg ist ein Ding und die Erdscholle auf dem Acker. \nDer Krug ist ein Ding und der Brunnen am Weg . . . .

In the \ncenter, another \"turn-up,\" one shoe exhibits its sale. I say \"collar\" \nbecause of the neck ( from head to foot) \n-or the cervix [in French: col de l'uterus]. \n-All this aggravates Heidegger's referentialist, monorefer\u00ad\nential naivete. This must be emphasized with respect to a dis\u00ad\ncourse on The Origin of the Work of Art. It can't not have some \nrelationship with the whole undertaking. And yet: \na. Heidegger \"is well aware,\" and Schapiro knows that he is \nwell aware: \"Van Gogh painted such shoes more than once\" \n(solches Schuhzeug mehrmals gemalt hat).

Let's \ngo on. \"In order to describe them, we do not need to have in front \nof us real samples of useful objects of this type. Everyone is fa\u00ad\nmiliar with them.

The \"same truth\" could be \"presented\" by any shoe \npainting, or even by any experience of shoes and even of any \n\"product\" in general: the truth being that of a being-product com\u00ad\ning back from \"further away\" than the matter-form couple, further \naway even than a \"distinction between the two.\" This truth is \ndue to a \"more distant origin.\" It is not the truth of a relationship \n(of adequation or attribution) between such-and-such a product \nand such-and-such an owner, user, holder, bearer/wearer-borne. \nThe belonging of the product \"shoes\" does not relate to a given \nsubjectum, or even to a given world.

The only object in \nview is this pair of peasants' shoes mentioned earlier. No trait \nspecific to the picture. After the \"And yet\" ( followed by a period \nand a new paragraph), the pathetic tirade (what else can you call \nit?) has the form of an escaping meditation. But escaping from a \npicture which has only been evoked and into which neither gaze \nnor discourse has yet penetrated, which they have not even ap\u00ad\nproached or brushed with a description.

But once \nmore one can only make this into an objection by attributing to \nHeidegger an intention, which nothing in his text shows to be \nthere, of describing and referring only to painted shoes, particular \npainted shoes, within the limits of a frame which can only be \ncrossed in one direction: from the outside to the inside.

Heidegger begins a new paragraph, as he had after \" Und \ndennoch/l, and he writes: \"But perhaps we see all this only on \nthe shoes in the picture (im Eilde, or in image),\" as a picture, as \nan image, etc. The fact that he says \"perhaps,\" that he pretends, \nat least hypothetically, to see a limit in a description constrained \nor contained by pictorial determinations, this simple fact clarifies \nthe possibility of crossing the frame in both directions.

She stands \nand walks in them. This is how the shoes are actually of service. \nThrough the process of using the product the properly product of \nthe product must come to meet us.\" \nStill within this first phase, Heidegger pretends-it's a rhe\u00ad\ntorical procedure-to draw a consequence from what has just been \nsaid: if usefulness, the essence of the being-product, can only \nappear in the course of use, by use, if use can only, as he thinks, \nbe actual, actuality itself, then the picture is of no use for acceding \nto what serves, to the usefulness of the product. It is useless for \nthe apprehension of the useful. But why? \nApparently for a single reason. But this reason doubles up and \nthis doubling interests me. Again it is a movement of interlacing \nby the lace. Let us understand at least three things by this word: \n( I ) the interlacing of the lace with itself; (2) the fact that it is also \nincompletely laced (entre-lace, as you say entrouvert [half-open] \n"
