The \ufb01rst step of this deconstruction\nof philosophy, which attempts to locate that which is present nowhere\nin philosophy. i.e., that which philosophy must hide in order to\nremain philosophy, is precisely the examination of the notion of presence\nas undertaken by Heidegger. Heidegger, says Derrida, recognized in the\nnotion of presence the \u201cdestiny of philosophy,\u201d and the reference to\nthe Heideggerean deconstruction of presence is a constant throughout\nDerrida\u2019s works. (Indeed, the reader unfamiliar with Heidegger may\nwell be mysti\ufb01ed by Derrida\u2019s frequent references to the notion of\npresence as the central target in the deconstruction of philosophy.) The\ngrammatological (from the Greek gramma meaning letter or writing)\nopening consists in the examination of the treatment of writing by\nphilosophy, as a \u201cparticularly revelatory symptom\u201d (Positions, p. 15)\nboth of how the notion of presence functions in philosophy and of\nwhat this notion serves to repress. Derrida arrived at this position\nthrough a close scrutiny of the philosophical genealogy of linguistics,\nespecially the philosophical treatment of the sign. From Plato to\nHeidegger himself, Derrida demonstrates, there is a persistent exclu-\nsion of the notion of writing from the philosophical de\ufb01nition of the\nsign. Since this exclusion can always be shown to be made in the name\nof presence\u2014the sign allegedly being most present in spoken discourse\u2014\nDerrida uses it as a \u201csymptom\u201d which reveals the workings of the\n\u201crepressive\u201d logic of presence, which determines Western philosophy\nas such.\nDerrida\u2019s division of L\u2019\u00e9criture et la di\ufb00\u00e9rence into two parts, then, serves\nto remind the reader that between the sixth and seventh essays a \u201ctheo-\nretical matrix\u201d was elaborated whose principles are to some extent\nderived from the \ufb01rst six essays and are more systematically put to\nwork in the last \ufb01ve. However, I would like to propose another division\nof the book, a division between the \ufb01fth (\u201c\u2018Genesis and Structure\u2019 and\nPhenomenology\u201d) and sixth essays. My reason for placing the division\nat this point stems from what Derrida says about La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne,\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxi\n"

This would make La\nvoix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne the sixth essay of a hypothetical twelve in L\u2019\u00e9criture et la\ndi\ufb00\u00e9rence, but in the form of a long footnote attached to the middle of\nthe volume.\nChronologically, of course, Derrida\u2019s division of L\u2019\u00e9criture et la di\ufb00\u00e9rence\nis more reasonable than the one I am proposing. I o\ufb00er this division,\nagain, to help orient the reader who comes to Writing and Di\ufb00erence\nknowing only that Derrida is very di\ufb03cult to read. Indeed, without\nsome foreknowledge of (1) the attempt already begun by Derrida in\n1959, but not presented until approximately the middle of this vol-\nume, to expand the deconstruction of metaphysics via a reading of\nHusserl\u2019s treatment of the sign; a reading which always pushes toward\na moment of irreducible di\ufb00erence conceived not only as the danger to\nthe doctrines of truth and meaning which are governed by presence,\nbut also as an inevitable danger in the form of writing which allows\ntruth and meaning to present themselves; and (2) the constant refer-\nence to Heidegger\u2019s analyses of the notion of presence, the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve\nessays of Writing and Di\ufb00erence might be incomprehensible. This is not to\ngainsay Derrida\u2019s statement that the last \ufb01ve essays only are \u201cengaged\nin the grammatological opening.\u201d These last \ufb01ve essays do follow\nDerrida\u2019s original publication (in Critique) of a systematic theoretical\nmatrix for a deconstruction of metaphysics along the lines \ufb01rst laid out\nin the analyses of Husserl; this is why La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne comes \ufb01rst.\nTherefore, without setting aside the speci\ufb01c, individual contents of the\n\ufb01rst \ufb01ve essays, one must also be alerted to their developing systematic-\nity, a systematicity whose guiding thread is embedded in the passage\njust cited from \u201c\u2018Genesis and Structure\u2019 and Phenomenology.\u201d The\nbest way to follow this thread is to pay close attention to Derrida\u2019s\ndemonstrations\u2014less and less elliptical as one continues through Writing\nand Di\ufb00erence\u2014of how philosophically \u201ctraditional\u201d some of the most\n\u201cmodern\u201d concepts of criticism and philosophy are, for example in the\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxiii\n"

Within the limits to which it is possible,\nor at least appears possible, translation practices the di\ufb00erence between\nsigni\ufb01ed and signi\ufb01er. But if this di\ufb00erence is never pure, translation is\nno more so; and for the notion of translation we would have to substi-\ntute a notion of transformation: a regulated transformation of one lan-\nguage by another, of one text by another. We will never have, and in fact\nhave never had, any \u2018transfer\u2019 of pure signi\ufb01eds\u2014from one language\nto another, or within one language\u2014which would be left virgin and\nintact by the signifying instrument or \u2018vehicle\u2019 \u201d (Positions, p. 31).\nThe translator, then, must be sure that he has understood the syntax\nand lexicon of the original text in order to let his own language carry\nout the work of transformation. Again, this is best facilitated by obey-\ning the strictures of his language, for a precipitate bending of it into\nunaccustomed forms may be indicative more of his own miscompre-\nhension than of di\ufb03culties in the original text. In this respect, the\ntranslator\u2019s position is analogous to that of the psychoanalyst who\nattempts to translate the manifest language of dreams into a latent\nlanguage. To do so, the analyst must \ufb01rst be sure that he has understood\nthe manifest language. As Derrida says in note 3 of \u201cCogito and the\nHistory of Madness,\u201d \u201cThe latent content of a dream (and of any\nconduct or consciousness in general) communicates with the manifest\ncontent only through the unity of a language; a language which the\nanalyst, then, must speak as well as possible.\u201d The discussion of terms\no\ufb00ered below, and the translator\u2019s footnotes in the text, are an attempt\nto provide a guide to the \u201cmanifest\u201d language of Writing and Di\ufb00erence.\nLike the analyst, however, the reader must let his attention \ufb02oat, and be\nsatis\ufb01ed with a partial understanding of a given essay on any particular\nreading. As the manifest language begins to become more familiar, the\npersistence of the \u201clatent\u201d content\u2014what Derrida has called \u201cthe\nunconscious of philosophical opposition\u201d (Positions, p. 60, note 6; my\nitalics)\u2014will become a surer guide, a more salient thread in the weave\nof these texts.\nDerrida\u2019s terms. Wherever Derrida uses di\ufb00\u00e9rance as a neologism I have left\nit untranslated. Its meanings are too multiple to be explained here fully,\nbut we may note brie\ufb02y that the word combines in neither the active\nnor the passive voice the coincidence of meanings in the verb di\ufb00\u00e9rer: to\ntranslator\u2019s introduction xvii\n"

Derrida also consistently plays on the derivation of sens (mean-\ning or sense; Sinn in German) which includes both a supposedly intelli-\ngible, rational sense (a signi\ufb01ed meaning) and a vehicle dependent on\nthe senses for its expression (the signi\ufb01er). Further, in French sens also\nmeans direction; to lose meaning is to lose direction, to be lost, to feel\nthat one is in a labyrinth. I have in\ufb02ected the translation of sens to\nconform to its play of meanings wherever possible.\nHeidegger\u2019s terms. While the concept of Being belongs to the entire meta-\nphysical tradition, its translation into English has become particularly\ndi\ufb03cult since Heidegger\u2019s analyses of it. German and French share the\nadvantage that their in\ufb01nitives meaning to be (sein, \u00eatre) can also be used\nas substantives that mean Being in general. Further, in each language\nthe present participle of the in\ufb01nitive (seiend, \u00e9tant) can also be used as a\nsubstantive meaning particular beings. No such advantage exists in Eng-\nlish, and since Heidegger is always concerned with the distinction\nbetween Sein (\u00eatre, Being in general) and Seiendes (\u00e9tant, beings) the cor-\nrect translation of these substantives becomes the \ufb01rst problem for any\nconsideration of Heidegger in English. (The verb forms present no\ndi\ufb03culties: sein and \u00eatre as in\ufb01nitives become to be, and the gerunds seiend\nand \u00e9tant become being.) I have followed the practice of John Macquar-\nrie and Edward Robinson in their translation of Being and Time (New\nYork: Harper and Row, 1962) and have translated the substantive\n(derived from the in\ufb01nitive) Sein (\u00eatre) as \u201cBeing\u201d (with a capital initial)\nwherever it appears in this volume. However I have modi\ufb01ed their\ntranslation of Seiendes (\u00e9tant)\u2014the substantive from the present\nparticiple\u2014as \u201centity\u201d or \u201centities,\u201d and have translated it as \u201cbeing\u201d or\n\u201cbeings.\u201d Macquarrie and Robinson, in fact, state that \u201cthere is much\nto be said\u201d for this translation (Being and Time, p. 22, note 1). I feel that it\nis preferable to \u201centity\u201d not only because, as they state, \u201cin recent\nBritish and American philosophy the term \u2018entity\u2019 has been used more\ngenerally to apply to anything whatsoever, no matter what its onto-\nlogical status\u201d (ibid.), but also because \u201centity\u201d derives from ens, the\nLatin present participle for the verb to be, esse. No one has been more\nattentive than Heidegger to the di\ufb03culties caused by the translation of\nGreek thought into Latin. The Latin inheritance of \u201centity\u201d continues\nthe tradition of these di\ufb03culties. Once more, we face the problem of\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxix\n"

There is one major excep-\ntion to the translation of \u00eatant by \u201cbeing,\u201d and this is in Violence and\nMetaphysics, Derrida\u2019s essay on Emmanuel Levinas. The major work by\nLevinas under consideration in this essay, Totalit\u00e9 et In\ufb01ni, has been trans-\nlated into English. Since much of this work is concerned with\nHeidegger, I have maintained the translation of \u00e9tant as \u201cexistent\u201d\u2014the\nsolution chosen by Alphonso Lingis, the translator of Totality and In\ufb01nity\u2014\nin all citations from this work. This translation is particularly problem-\natical in that it tends to confuse the distinction (in terms of Being and\nTime) between the existential, ontological status of Being, and the ontical\nstatus of being. The reader is requested to read \u201cbeing\u201d for \u201cexistent\u201d\nwherever the latter appears.\nThis brings us to another term, one from Heidegger\u2019s later\nthought\u2014that of di\ufb00erence. From the existential analytic of Dasein\u2014\nman\u2019s Being\u2014in Being and Time, Heidegger moved to a contemplation of\nthe di\ufb00erence between beings and Being in his later works. He calls this\nthe ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence, and this idea itself is submitted to powerful\nscrutiny in his Identity and Di\ufb00erence. The title of this work alone should\nbring it to the attention of the serious reader of Writing and Di\ufb00erence; in\nthe introduction to \u201cFreud and the Scene of Writing\u201d Derrida gives a\nbrief indication of the importance of Identity and Di\ufb00erence to Writing and\nDi\ufb00erence when he speaks of \u201cdi\ufb00\u00e9rance and identity,\u201d \u201cdi\ufb00\u00e9rance as the pre-\nopening of the ontico-ontological di\ufb00erence.\u201d From Identity and Di\ufb00erence\nalso comes the term onto-theology which characterizes Western meta-\nphysics as such. Very roughly put, Heidegger analyzes the contradic-\ntions of the logic of presence which is forced to conceive Being as the\nmost general attribute of existence (onto-), and as the \u201chighest,\u201d most\nspeci\ufb01c attribute of God (theo-). Logos is the true verb: the spoken dis-\ncourse in which the notion of truth governed by this onto-theo-logy of\npresence is revealed. Also from Identity and Di\ufb00erence, among other places\nin Heidegger, comes the concept of di\ufb00erence as it is inscribed in the\n\u201contological double genitive,\u201d i.e., the necessary \ufb02uctuation of the\nsubjective and objective cases in order to speak of Being, which always\nmeans the Being of beings and the beings of Being.\nFrom Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, the work which immediately\nfollows Being and Time, comes the term \u201cauto-a\ufb00ection, which Derrida\nuses often, and which I have discussed brie\ufb02y in note 25 of \u201c\u2018Genesis\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxx\n"

Throughout Writing and Di\ufb00erence\n\u201cvoluntarism\u201d must be read in its etymological sense of \u201cdoctrine of\nthe will,\u201d deriving as it does from the Latin voluntas (whence our \u201cvol-\nition\u201d). The French vouloir, to want, maintains its etymological reson-\nances in more striking fashion than do any of its English equivalents;\nDerrida plays on these resonances especially in connection with vouloir\ndire, which means either \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201cto mean,\u201d but has a strong\nconnotation of \u201cthe will to say.\u201d The concluding paragraphs of \u201cCogito\nand the History of Madness\u201d develop this point.\nHusserl\u2019s terms. The most important terms from Husserl are the linked\nconcepts of bracketing, epoch\u00e9, and the phenomenological reduction.\nThese are carefully explained in sections 31, 32, and 33 of Ideas (trans-\nlated by W. R. Boyce Gibson, New York: Macmillan, 1962). Husserl,\nfollowing Descartes\u2019s attempt to \ufb01nd absolutely certain truths by putt-\ning everything into doubt, proposes to put between brackets (or paren-\ntheses) \u201cthe general thesis which belongs to the essence of the natural\nstandpoint.\u201d This phenomenological \u201cabstention\u201d (epoch\u00e9) prohibits\nthe use of any \u201cjudgment that concerns spatio-temporal existence\u201d\n(Ideas, p. 100). \u201cPure consciousness\u201d becomes accessible through this\ntranscendental epoch\u00e9, which Husserl therefore speaks of as the phenom-\nenological reduction. The relationship of this \u201cpure consciousness\u201d\nto \u201cpure essences\u201d is governed by intentionality, for all consciousness is\nconsciousness of something, although again it is not a question of a\nrelationship to a psychological event (experience) or to a real object.\nSensory experience, the relationship to hyl\u00e9 (matter) contains nothing\nintentional for Husserl; it is intentional morph\u00e9 (form, shape) which\nbestows meaning on sensory experience. The opposition of hyl\u00e9 to\nmorph\u00e9 (matter to form) leads Husserl to divide \u201cphenomenological\nbeing\u201d into its hyletic and noetic (intentionally meaningful; from the\nGreek nous, meaning mind or spirit) sides.

As much of Ideas is\nconcerned with the theory of noetic-noematic structures, the reader\nwill appreciate the inadequacy of these remarks.\nHegel\u2019s terms. The most important term from Hegel, Aufhebung, is untrans-\nlatable due to its double meaning of conservation and negation. (The\nvarious attempts to translate Aufhebung into English seem inadequate.)\nThe reader is referred to Derrida\u2019s discussion of the term in \u201cViolence\nand Metaphysics,\u201d section III, \ufb01rst subsection (\u201cOf the Original\nPolemic), B, and to the translator\u2019s notes in \u201cFrom Restricted to General\nEconomy,\u201d where other terms from Hegel are discussed. The Hegelian\n\ufb01gure of the \u201cunhappy consciousness\u201d is discussed in note 23 of Vio-\nlence and Metaphysics, but there is also an important discussion of it at the\nbeginning of \u201cCogito and the History of Madness.\u201d The unhappy con-\nsciousness, for Hegel, is always divided against itself; its historical \ufb01g-\nure is Abraham, the prototype of the \u201cJewish\u201d consciousness for which\nthere is an intrinsic con\ufb02ict between God and nature. In many ways the\ntheme of the unhappy consciousness runs throughout Writing and Di\ufb00er-\nence. \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d is epigraphically submitted to the\ncon\ufb02ict between the Greek\u2014\u201chappy,\u201d at one with nature\u2014and the\nHebraic\u2014unhappy\u2014consciousnesses. Like all inherited oppositions, this\none too is programmed by the logic of presence which demands a\nchoice between the terms, or a resolution of the con\ufb02ict. Derrida\npushes the unhappy consciousness to its logical limits in order to bring\nit to the point where the division within it becomes irreducible. This\noccurs most importantly in the two essays devoted to Jab\u00e8s, whose\npoetry interrogates the meaning of the Jewish, divided consciousness.\nThis interrogation becomes particularly poignant for Derrida in its ties\nto the Jewish, unhappy consciousness as the experience of the (people\nof the) Book and Writing, for, as discussed above, these are the\ninherited concepts which are Derrida\u2019s central targets. Derrida has\nclosed each of the essays on Jab\u00e8s with the name of one of Jab\u00e8s\u2019s\nimaginary rabbis: Rida and Derissa. In this way he alerts us to the\n\u201clatent,\u201d philosophically \u201cunconscious\u201d impact of Writing and Di\ufb00erence:\nan expanded concept of di\ufb00erence through the examination of writing.\ntranslator\u2019s introduction\nxxii\n"

The structuralist\nsolicitude and solicitation give themselves only the illusion of technical\nliberty when they become methodical. In truth, they reproduce, in the\nregister of method, a solicitude and solicitation of Being, a historico-\nmetaphysical threatening of foundations. It is during the epochs of\nhistorical dislocation, when we are expelled from the site, that this\nstructuralist passion, which is simultaneously a frenzy of experimenta-\ntion and a proliferation of schematizations, develops for itself. The\nbaroque would only be one example of it. Has not a \u201cstructural\npoetics\u201d \u201cfounded on a rhetoric\u201d6 been mentioned in relation to the\nbaroque?

From his\n\ufb01rst page on, he links \u201cthe nature of the literary fact,\u201d always insu\ufb03-\nciently examined, to the \u201crole in art of imagination, that fundamental\nactivity\u201d about which \u201cuncertainties and oppositions abound.\u201d This\nnotion of an imagination that produces metaphor\u2014that is, everything in\nlanguage except the verb to be\u2014remains for critics what certain philo-\nsophers today call a naively utilized operative concept. To surmount this\ntechnical ingenuousness is to re\ufb02ect the operative concept as a thematic\nconcept. This seems to be one of Rousset\u2019s projects.\nTo grasp the operation of creative imagination at the greatest pos-\nsible proximity to it, one must turn oneself toward the invisible\ninterior of poetic freedom. One must be separated from oneself in\norder to be reunited with the blind origin of the work in its darkness.\nThis experience of conversion, which founds the literary act (writing\nor reading), is such that the very words \u201cseparation\u201d and \u201cexile,\u201d\nwhich always designate the interiority of a breaking-o\ufb00 with the world\nand a making of one\u2019s way within it, cannot directly manifest the\nexperience; they can only indicate it through a metaphor whose\ngenealogy itself would deserve all of our e\ufb00orts.18 For in question here\nis a departure from the world toward a place which is neither a non-place\nnor an other world, neither a utopia nor an alibi, the creation of \u201ca\nuniverse to be added to the universe,\u201d according to an expression of\nFocillon\u2019s cited by Rousset (Forme et Signi\ufb01cation, p. 11). This universe\narticulates only that which is in excess of everything, the essential\nnothing on whose basis everything can appear and be produced within\nlanguage; and the voice of Maurice Blanchot reminds us, with the\ninsistence of profundity, that this excess is the very possibility of writing\nand of literary inspiration in general. Only pure absence\u2014not the absence of\nthis or that, but the absence of everything in which all presence is\nannounced\u2014can inspire, in other words, can work, and then make one\nwork. The pure book naturally turns toward the eastern edge of this\nabsence which, beyond or within the prodigiousness of all wealth, is\nits \ufb01rst and proper content.

In a fragment of a book he intended to devote to The Origin of\nTruth, Merleau-Ponty wrote: \u201cCommunication in literature is not the\nsimple appeal on the part of the writer to meanings which would be\npart of an a priori of the mind; rather, communication arouses these\nmeanings in the mind through enticement and a kind of oblique\naction.

It does not know where it is going, no\nknowledge can keep it from the essential precipitation toward the\nmeaning that it constitutes and that is, primarily, its future. However, it\nis capricious only through cowardice. There is thus no insurance\nagainst the risk of writing. Writing is an initial and graceless recourse\nfor the writer, even if he is not an atheist but, rather, a writer. Did Saint\nJohn Chrysostom speak of the writer? \u201cIt were indeed meet for us not\nat all to require the aid of the written Word, but to exhibit a life so\npure, that the grace of the spirit should be instead of books to our\nsouls, and that as these are inscribed with ink, even so should our\nhearts be with the Spirit.

And, paradoxically, inscription alone\u2014\nalthough it is far from always doing so\u2014has the power of poetry, in\nother words has the power to arouse speech from its slumber as sign.\nBy enregistering speech, inscription has as its essential objective, and\nindeed takes this fatal risk, the emancipation of meaning\u2014as concerns\nany actual \ufb01eld of perception\u2014from the natural predicament in which\neverything refers to the disposition of a contingent situation. This is\nwhy writing will never be simple \u201cvoice-painting\u201d (Voltaire).

The will to write is not an ulterior determination of a primal will.\nOn the contrary, the will to write reawakens the willful sense of the\nwill: freedom, break with the domain of empirical history, a break\nwhose aim is reconciliation with the hidden essence of the empirical,\nwith pure historicity.

In its relationship to Being, the attempt-to-write poses itself\nas the only way out of a\ufb00ectivity. A way out that can only be aimed at,\nand without the certainty that deliverance is possible or that it is out-\nside a\ufb00ectivity. To be a\ufb00ected is to be \ufb01nite: to write could still be to\ndeceive \ufb01nitude, and to reach Being\u2014a kind of Being which could\nneither be, nor a\ufb00ect me by itself\u2014from without existence. To write\nwould be to attempt to forget di\ufb00erence: to forget writing in the pres-\nence of so-called living and pure speech.35\nIn the extent to which the literary act proceeds from this attempt-to-\nwrite, it is indeed the acknowledgment of pure language, the responsi-\nbility confronting the vocation of \u201cpure\u201d speech which, once\nunderstood, constitutes the writer as such. Heidegger says of pure\nspeech that it cannot \u201cbe conceived in the rigor of its essence\u201d on the\nbasis of its \u201ccharacter-as-sign\u201d (Zeichencharakter), \u201cnor even perhaps of\nits character-as-signi\ufb01cation\u201d (Bedeutungscharakter).36\nDoes not one thus run the risk of identifying the work with original\nwriting in general? Of dissolving the notion of art and the value of\n\u201cbeauty\u201d by which literature is currently distinguished from the letter\nin general? But perhaps by removing the speci\ufb01city of beauty from\naesthetic values, beauty is, on the contrary, liberated? Is there a\nspeci\ufb01city of beauty, and would beauty gain from this e\ufb00ort?\nRousset believes so. And the structuralism proper to Jean Rousset is\nde\ufb01ned, at least theoretically, against the temptation to overlook this\nspeci\ufb01city (the temptation that would be Poulet\u2019s, for example, since\nhe \u201chas little interest in art\u201d),37 putting Rousset close to Leo Spitzer and\nMarcel Raymond in his scrupulousness about the formal autonomy of\nthe work\u2014an \u201cindependent, absolute organism that is self-su\ufb03cient\u201d\n(Forme et Signi\ufb01cation p. xx). \u201cThe work is a totality and always gains from\nbeing experienced as such\u201d (p. xxi). But here again, Rousset\u2019s position\ndepends upon a delicate balance. Always attentive to the uni\ufb01ed foun-\ndations of dissociation, he circumvents the \u201cobjectivist\u201d danger\ndenounced by Poulet by giving a de\ufb01nition of structure that is not\npurely objective or formal; or circumvents the \u201cobjectivist\u201d danger\ndenounced by Poulet by giving a de\ufb01nition of structure that is not\npurely objective or formal; or circumvents it by at least not in principle\ndissociating form from intention, or from the very act of the writer: \u201cI\nwriting and difference\n14\n"

But the end in sight\nis indeed the simultaneous comprehension of a homogenous reality in\na unifying operation\u201d (p. xxii).\nBut condemned or resigned to alternation, the critic, in acknowledg-\ning it, is also liberated and acquitted by it. And it is here that Rousset\u2019s\ndi\ufb00erence is no longer deliberate. His personality, his style will a\ufb03rm\nthemselves not through a methodological decision but through the\nplay of the critic\u2019s spontaneity within the freedom of the \u201calternative.\u201d\nThis spontaneity will, in fact, unbalance an alternation construed by\nRousset as a theoretical norm.
