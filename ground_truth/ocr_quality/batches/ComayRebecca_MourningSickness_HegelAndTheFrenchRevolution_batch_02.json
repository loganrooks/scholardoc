Kant\u2019s arguments against revolution are \nvarious and scattered\u2014none very good\u2014appealing to everything from \npositive law to divine commandment.33 They invoke an ascending series \nof formal tautologies centered on issues of jurisprudence. (As Kant him-\nself makes very explicit, this formalism makes his arguments equally ap-\nplicable to counter\u00adrevolutions, coups d\u2019\u00e9tat, and restorations, and some \nreaders have even claimed that Kant\u2019s chaotic attack on revolution is actu-\nally a veiled attempt to protect the Revolution from counterrevolutionary \nreaction.) \u201cOnce a revolution has succeeded and a new constitution has \nbeen established, the lack of legitimacy with which it began and has been \nimplemented cannot release the subjects from complying with the new \norder of things.\u201d34\nIt comes down to this: revolution is against the law (!)\u2014not just against \nactually existing laws, but against lawfulness as such, against the very idea \nof public law, against the irresistibility of the moral law,35 and ultimately \nagainst the sacral authority of the Law itself in its unbreachable transcen-\ndence.

The \nrotting corpse of Polyneices will be a permanent reminder of what re-\nmains unburied and unmourned in every struggle for legitimacy.\nThe task of modernity will be to explore this fissure. The rubble of \nSittlichkeit had revealed what all ruins do, namely that the world is con-\nstructed. If the polis looked beautiful, this is because it was already artifice \nand artifact\u2014the product of construction and as such susceptible to un-\nmaking or deconstruction. Modernity begins with this corrosively denat-\nuralizing insight. This is why its setting is the demolition zone left upon \nthe collapse of Greek Sittlichkeit, as the rift became a chasm, the gods fled, \nthe dead sank into oblivion, and the world disintegrated into a heap of \nisolated particles and scattered stage props\u2014\u201ccold, soulless atoms.\u201d The \nonly way of imparting unity to this pulverized universe was through the \nabstract force of a law stripped of all legitimacy (and thus requiring for its \nexecution the military prowess of a ruler whose own authority had been \nreduced to an ostentatious display of destructive, orgiastic excess) (PhG \n\u00a7481). This is how Hegel sums up the accomplishments of the Roman Em-\npire\u2014\u201ca miserable life of worms.\u201d11 Hegel is the last one to belittle these \nworms. The achievement of the imperium remains colossal: it makes chill-\ningly explicit the profundity of the disenchantment.\nModernity takes ruination (Verw\u00fcstung) as its foundation (PhG \n\u00a7472). The world in which we find ourselves is a manufactured one, \nbeauty is a masquerade (the Roman citizen is thus a \u201cperson\u201d or persona, \na mask or theatrical impersonation, and the state a spectacular one),12 \nand we must henceforth invent what we discover. This is why the mod-\nern world defines itself explicitly as \u201cculture\u201d (Bildung): it is our way of \nregistering that we place ourselves in a world of our own making (PhG \n\u00a7484).

Utilitarianism is the first stop along the \nway. Hegel describes this as the relentless consumerism that appropriates, \nmanipulates, and exploits the last shred of objectivity, including that of \nthe social world. The human community will be reduced to a collective \nsurvival mechanism regulated by a tepid pleasure principle dedicated to \nthe rule of maximum reciprocal serviceability: the gang or \u201ctroop\u201d (Trupp) \nrampaging like animals in the garden of Eden\u2014Hegel\u2019s startling anticipa-\ntion of Nietzsche\u2019s description of utilitarianism as a herd morality. \u201cOne \nhand washes the other\u201d (\u00a7560). Hegel darkly suggests that this collective \nself-regulation is a thinly veiled defense against what lies beyond the plea-\nsure principle. This is why utilitarianism is a slave ideology: I learn to wait. \nI pace my pleasure, I dilute it, I diversify it, I experiment with it, I count \nit, I parcel it into bite-sized units, I want it to last forever, I make use of \nthe world so as to curb my own unappeasable desire to consume it, to de-\nstroy it, to use it up.

Repetitive, inexpressive, featureless, the scaf-\nfold becomes at once a setting, a stage prop and the leading player (personi-\nfied invariably as dripping female\u2014Sainte \u00adGuillotine, holy mother, vagina \ndentata, etc.) of a continuous drama in which the pornographic keeps alter-\nnating with the grotesque, the uncanny with the carnivalesque, the maudlin \nwith the magical, the ghoulish with the prosaic, the orgiastic with the dis-\ngusting, and the boring with the even more boring.

He \nis focused on a more intractable antinomy. His target is the paradox of a \nmurder that strips away, not just the life, but the prior subjectivity of the \nvictim. The elimination of face-to-face contact between victim and execu-\ntioner (\u201cthe axe is seen rather than the hand that set it in motion\u201d)36 is one \naspect of this obliteration. The guillotine retroactively retracts the mini-\nmal recognition it concedes its victim (as worthy of suspicion in the first \nplace) in that it directs itself toward an already annihilated nonentity. By \nstripping death of its intensity and singularity it provides a practical dem-\nonstration of the object\u2019s nullity. The guillotine\u2019s essential function is in \nthis sense to render itself inessential or redundant.

As if to prove \nthe uncertainty of the distinction between the living and the dead, even \ncorpses had to be killed, and statues beheaded. The lifeless bodies of those \nwho had tried to cheat the machine by committing suicide were propped \nup in the tumbrel alongside living victims and carried to the scaffold. The \niteration suggests the multifarious logic of the death drive: every death is a \nsecond death; the dead are never quite dead enough; and even the dead are \nnever safe. The quicklime that swallowed the corpse within the anonym-\nity of the mass grave confirms that we are in the region of what Adorno \ncalls the \u201cphilosopheme of pure identity\u201d\u2014death in its most unsublimated \ninsignificance: modern death. Creon\u2019s Pyrrhic victory is near complete. \nHegel names a death \u201cwhich has no inner significance or filling, for what \nis negated is the empty point of the absolutely free self\u201d (PhG \u00a7590).

Hegel backdates the Ter-\nror to the very onset of the revolution: June 17, 1789. This was the day the \n\u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux spontaneously and virtually unanimously recreated itself as \nthe Assembl\u00e9e nationale, sworn to perpetual and uninterrupted convoca-\ntion, sole agent and embodiment of the nation\u2019s will.\nWith the Tennis Court Oath, the ex nihilo transition of the tiers \u00e9tat \nfrom \u201cnothing\u201d to \u201ceverything\u201d was both affirmed and performatively ac-\ncomplished: the oath both marked and made the people\u2019s transition from \npolitical nullity to the \u201ccomplete nation\u201d that it would retroactively deter-\nmine itself to have always already been. Because it defined itself as struc-\nturally complete, the nation had to surgically eliminate what differed from \nit as an excrescence whose very existence was a contradiction. This is why \nthe founding act of revolutionary democracy is the purge. This literaliza-\ntion of Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s\u2019s formula establishes political modernity as a fellowship \nof terror. With this gesture, \u201cthe undivided substance of absolute freedom \nascends to the throne of the world without any power being able to resist \nit\u201d (PhG \u00a7585).\nIn identifying the Terror with the origin of the Revolution, Hegel has \ninevitably been compared to Edmund Burke (whose Reflections on the Rev-\nolution in France had been almost immediately translated, and in Hegel\u2019s \nfavorite journal), to Louis de Bonald and Hippolyte Taine (for whom the \nslide from the Revolution of liberty to the despotism of equality was pre-\ndestined), and even to Joseph de Maistre (for whom the Terror was the \nprovidential punishment for the hubris of human self-assertion). Such \ncomparisons only have a tiny degree of justice, even if Hegel\u2019s inexplicable \nsavagery to Rousseau does nothing to discourage them (for the record, his \nrhetoric does stop short of Burke\u2019s hysterical denunciation of Rousseau as \nan \u201cinsane Socrates\u201d).
