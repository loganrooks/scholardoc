Even by the sharpest and most perseveringl \n'perception' and 'representation' of Things, one can never discover any-\n355 \nthing like the damaging of a tool. If we are to encounter anything un\u00ad\nmanageable, the handling must be of such a sort that it can be disturbed. \nBut what does this signify ontological!JI? The making-present which awaits \nand retains, gets held up with regard to its absorption in relationships of \ninvolvement, and it gets held up by what will exhibit itself afterwards as \ndamage. The making-present, which awaits the \"towards-which\" with \nequal primordiality, is held fast along\u009eide the equipment which has been \nused, and it is held fast in such a manner, indeed, that the \"towards\u00ad\nwhich\" and the \"in-order-to\" are now encountered explicitly for the first \ntime. On the other hand, the only way in which the making\u009fpresent itself \ncan meet up with anything unsuitable, is by already operating in such a \nway as to retain awaitingly that which has an involvement in something. \nTo say that making-present gets 'held up' is to say that in its unity with \nthe awaiting which retains, it diverts itself into itself more and more, and \nis thus constitutive for the 'inspecting' [\"Nachsehen\"], testing, and elimin\u00ad\nating of the disturbance. If concemful dealings were merely a sequence of \n'Experiences' running their course 'in time', however intimately these \nmight be 'associated', it would still be ontologically impossible to let any \nconspicuous unusable equipment be encountered. Letting something be \ninvolved must, as such, be grounded in the ecstatical unity of the making\u00ad\npresent which awaits and retains, whatever we have made accessible in \ndealing with contexts of equipment.\u2022 \nAnd how is it possible to 'ascertain' what is missing [Fehlendem]-that \nis to say, un-ready-to-hand, not just ready-to-hand in an unmanageable \nway ? That which is un-ready-to-hand is discovered circumspectively \nwhen we miss it [im Vmnissen]. The 'affirmation' that something is not \npresent-at-hand, is founded upon our missing it; and both our missing it \nand our affirmation have their own existential presuppositions.

In the not awaiting of the \nmaking-present which is lost, the 'horizonal' leeway within which one's \nDasein can be assailed by something surprising is first disclosed. \nThat with which one's concernful dealings fail to cope, either by pro\u00ad\nducing or procuring something, or even by turning away, holding aloof, \nor protecting oneselffrom something, reveals itself in its insurmountability. \nConcern resigns itself to it.1 But resigning oneself to something is a mode \n356 \npeculiar to circumspectively letting it be encountered.

What is decisive in the 'emergence' of the theoretical attitude \nwould then lie in the disappearance of praxis. So if one posits 'practical' \nconcern as the primary and predominant kind of Being which factical \nDasein possesses, the ontological possibility of 'theory' will be due to the \nabsence of praxis-that is, to a privation. But the discontinuance of a specific \nmanipulation in our concernful dealings does not simply leave the guiding \ncircumspection behind as a remainder. Rather, our concern then diverts \nitself specifically into a just-looking-around [ein Nur-sich-umsehen] .

That which has already been laid open in awaiting and retaining \nis brought closer by one's deliberative making-present or envisaging.1 \nBut if deliberation is to be able to operate in the scheme of the 'if-then', \nconcern must already have 'surveyed' a context of involvements and have \nan understanding of it. That which is considered with an 'if' must already \nbe understood as something or other. This does not require that the under\u00ad\nstanding of equipment be expressed in a predication. The schema 'some\u00ad\nthing as something' has already been sketched out beforehand in the \nstructure of one's pre-predicative understanding. The as-structure is \ngrounded ontologically in the temporality of understanding. But on the \nother hand, only to the extent that Dasein, in awaiting some possibility \n(here this means a \"towards-which\"), has come back to a \"towards-this\" \ng6o \n(that is to say that it retains something ready-to-hand)--<>nly to this \nextent can the making-present which belongs to this awaiting and retain-\ning, start with what is thus retained, and bring it, in its character of having \nbeen assigned or referred to its \"towards-which\", explicitly closer.

Only \nthat this elucidates the Situation in which circumspective concern changes \nover into theoretical discovering-a Situation of the kind which belongs \nto Dasein. We may then try to analyse this change-over itself by taking \nas our clue an elementary assertion which is circumspectively deliberative \nin character and the modifications which are possible for it. \nWhen we are using a tool circumspectively, we can say, for instance, \nthat the hammer is too heavy or too light. Even the proposition that the \nhammer is heavy can give expression to a concernful deliberation, and \nsignify that the hamer is not an easy one-in other words, that it takes \nforce to handle it, or that it wil be hard to manipulate.1 But this pro\u00ad\nposition can also mean that the entity before us, which we already know \n361 \ncircumspectively as a hammer, has a weight-that is to say, i t  has the \n'property' of heaviness : it exerts a pressure on what lies beneath it, and \nit falls if this is removed. When this kind of talk is so understood, it is no \nlonger spoken within the horizon of awaiting and retaining an equipmental \ntotality and its involvement-relationships. What is said has been drawn \nfrom looking at what is suitable for an entity with 'mass'. We have now \nsighted something that is suitable for the hammer, not as a tool, but as a \ncorporeal Thing subject to the law of gravity. To talk circumspectively of \n'too heavy' or 'too light' no longer has any 'meaning' ;  that is to say, the \nentity in itself, as we now encounter it, gives us nothing with relation to \nwhich it could be 'found' too heavy or too light. \nWhy is it that what we are talking about-the heavy hammer-shows \nitself differently when our way of talking is thus modified ? Not because \nwe are keeping our distance from manipulation, nor because we are just \nlooking away [absehen] from the equipmental character of this entity, \nbut rather because we are looking at [ansehen] the ready-to-hand thing \nwhich we encounter, and looking at it 'in a new way' as something present\u00ad\nat-hand. The understanding of Being by which our concernful dealings with \nentities within-the-world have been guided has changed over.

In existing, \nit has been thrown; and as something thrown, it has been delivered over to \nentities which it needs in order to be able to be as it is-namely, for the sake \nof itself. In so far as Dasein exists factically, it understands itself in the \nway its \"for-the-sake-of-itself\" is thus connected with some current \"in\u00ad\norder-to\". That inside which existing Dasein understands itself, is 'there' \nalong with its factical existence. That inside which one primarily under\u00ad\nstands oneself has Dasein's kind of Being. Dasein is its world existingly. \nWe have defined Dasein's Being as \"care\". The ontological meaning of \n\"care\" is temporality. We have shown that temporality constitutes the \n365 \ndisclosedness of the \"there\", and we- have shown how it does so. In \nthe disclosedness of the \"there\" the world is disclosed along with it. The \nunity of significance-that is, the ontological constitution of the world\u00ad\nmust then likewise be grounded in temporality. The existential-temporal \ncondition for the possibility of the world lies in the fact that temporality, as an \necstatical unity, has something like a horizon. Ecstases are not simply raptures \nin which one gets carried away. Rather, there belongs to each ecstasis a \n'whither' to which one is carried away.1 This \"whither\" of the ecstasis \nwe call the \"horizonal schema\". In each of the three ecstases the ecstatical \nhorizon is different. The schema in which Dasein comes towards itself \nfuturally, whether authentically or inauthentically, is the ''for-the-sake-of\u00ad\nitself\". The schema in which Dasein is disclosed to itself in a state-of-mind \nas thrown, is to be taken as that in the face of which it has been thrown \nand that to which it has been abandoned. This characterizes the horizonal \nschema of what has been. In existing for the sake of itself in abandonment \nto itself as something that has been thrown, Dasein, as Being-alongside, \nis at the same time making present. The horizonal schema for the Present \nis defined by the \"in-order-to\". \nThe unity of the horizonal schemata of future, Present, and having \nbeen, is grounded in the ecstatical unity of temporality. The horizon of \ntemporality as a whole determines that whereupon [woraufhin] factically \nexisting entities are essentially disclosed. With one's factical Being-there, a \npotentiality-for-Being is in each case projected in the horizon of the \nfuture, one's 'Being-already' is disclosed in the horizon of having been, \nand that with which one concerns oneself is discovered in the horizon of \nthe Present. The horizonal unity of the schemata of these ecstases makes \npossible the primordial way in which the relationships of the \"in-order\u00ad\nto\" are connected with the \"for-the-sake-of\". This implies that on the \nbasis of the horizonal constitution of the ecstatical unity of temporality, \n1 'Die Ekstasen sind nicht einfach Entruckungen zu . . .

In so \nfar as Dasein temporalizes itself, a world is too. In temporalizing itself \nwith regard to its Being as temporality, Dasein is1 essentially 'in a world', \nby reasqn of the ecstatico-horizonal constitution of that temporality. The \nworld is neither present-at-hand nor ready-to-hand, but temporalizes \nitself in temporality. It 'is', with the \"outside-of-itself\" of the ecstases, \n'there'.

What is rather the case is that factical Dasein, \nunderstanding itself and its world ecstatically in the unity of the \"there\", \ncomes back from these horizons to the entities encountered within them. \nComing back to these entities understandingly is the existential meaning \nof letting them be encountered by making them present; that is why we \ncall them entities \"within-the-world\". The world is, as it were, already \n'further outside' than any Object can ever be. The 'problem of trans\u00ad\ncendence' cannot be brought round to the question of how a subject comes \nout to an Object, where the aggregate of Objects is identified with the idea \nof the world. Rather we must ask : what makes it ontologically possible \nfor entities to be encountered within-the-world and Objectified as so \n1 Italics supplied in later editions only. \n0 \n"

At the same time it becomes plain \nthat a, concrete working-out of the world-structure in general and its \npossible variations can be tackled only if the ontology of possible entities \nwithin-the-world is oriented securely enough by clarifying the idea of \nBeing in general.

The Temporality of the Spatiality that is Characteristic of Dasein \nThough the expression 'temporality' does not signify what one under\u00ad\nstands by \"time\" when one talks about 'space and time', nevertheless \nspatiality seems to make up another basic attribute of Dasein correspond\u00ad\ning to temporality. Thus with Dasein's spatiality, existential-temporal \nanalysis seems to come to a limit, so that this entity which we call \n\"Dasein\", must be considered as 'temporal' 'and also' as spatial co\u00ad\nordinately. Has our existential-temporal analysis of Dasein thus been \nbrought to a halt by that phenomenon with which we have become \nacquainted as the spatiality that is characteristic of Dasein, and which \nwe have pointed out as belonging to Being-in-the-world ?xxv \nIf in the\u00b7 course of our existential Interpretation we were to talk \nabout Dasein's having a 'spatia-temporal' character, we could not mean \nthat this entity is present-at-hand 'in space and also in time' ; this needs \nno further discussion. Temporality is the meaning of the Being of care. \nDasein's constitution and its ways to be are possible ontologically only on \nthe basis of temporality, regardless of whether this entity occurs 'in time' \nor not. Hence Dasein's specific spatiality must be grounded in temporality. \nOn the other hand, the demonstration that this spatiality is existentially \npossible only through temporality, cannot aim either at deducing space \nfrom time or at dissolving it into pure time. If Dasein's spatiality is \n'embraced' by temporality in the sense of being existentially founded upon \nit, then this connection between them (which is to be clarified in what \nfollows) is also different from the priority of time over space in Kant's \nsense.

We must first remember in what way Dasein is \nspatial. Dasein can be spatial only as care, in the sense of existing as \nfactically falling. Negatively this means that Dasein is never present-at-\n368 \nhand in space, not even proximally. Dasein does not fil up a bit of space \nas a Real Thing or item of equipment would, so that the boundaries \ndividing it from the surrounding space would themselves just define that \nspace spatially. Dasein takes space in; this is to be understood literally.1 \nIt is by no means just present-at-hand in a bit of space which its body \nfills up. In existing, it has already made room for its own leeway. It \ndetermines its own location in such a manner that it comes back from the \nspace it has made room for to the 'place' which it has reserved. 1 To be \nable to say that Dasein is present-at-hand at a position in space, we must \nfirst take [auffassen] this entity in a way which is ontologically inappro\u00ad\npriate. Nor does the distinction between the 'spatiality' of an extended \nThing and that of Dasein lie in the fact that Dasein knows about space; \nfor taking space in [das Raum-einnehmen] is so far from identical with \na 'representing' of the spatial, that it is presupposed by it instead. Neither \nmay Dasein's spatiality be interpreted as an imperfection which adheres \nto existence by reason of the fatal 'linkage ofthe spirit to a body'. On the \ncontrary, because Dasein is 'spiritual', and onry because of this, it can be \nspatial in a way which remains essentially impossible for any extended \ncorporeal Thing. \nDasein's making room for itself is constituted by directionality and \nde-severance. How is anything of this sort existentially possible on the \n1 'Das Dasein nimmt-im wortlichen Verstande-Raum ein.' The expression 'nimmt \nRaum ein' would ordinarily be translatable as 'occupies space' or even 'takes up space'. \nBut Heidegger is here interpreting it in a way which is closer to the root meaning. \n2 'Existierend hat es sich je schon einen Spielraum eingeriiumt. Es bestinunt je seinen \neigenen Ort so, das es aus dem eingeriiumten Raum auf den \"Platz\" zuriickkommt, \nden es belegt hat.' This pasage can be read in several ways. 'Spielraum' (our 'leeway') \nmeans literally a 'space-or room-for playing'. The expresion 'belegen einen Platz' \nordinarily means to book or reserve a seat at a theatre or some other place of entertain\u00ad\nment; but in a more general and basic sense, 'belegen' (which is a word of many mean\u00ad\nings) can also mean to spread something over something else so as to 'occupy' it \ncompletely-as one spreads a slice of bread with butter or covers a wall with plaster. \nOn 'einraumen' see our note 1, p. I46, H. I 1 I above. \n"

The function of temporality as the founda\u00ad\ntion for Dasein's spatiality will be indicated briefly, but no more than is \nnecessary for our later discussions of the ontological meaning of the \n'coupling together' of space and time. To Dasein's making room for itself \nbelongs the self-directive discovery of something like a region. By this \nexpression what we have in mind in the first instance is the \"whither\" for \nthe possible belonging-somewhere of equipment which is ready-to-hand \nenvironmentally and which can be placed. Whenever one comes across \nequipment, handles it, or moves it around or out of the way, some region \nhas already been discovered. Concernful Being-in-the-world is directional \n-self-directive. Belonging-somewhere has an essential relationship to \ninvolvement. It always Determines itself factically in \nterms of the \ninvolvement-context of the equipment with which one concerns oneself. \nRelationships of involvement are intelligible only within the horizon of \na world that has been disclosed. Their horizonal character, moreover, \nis what first makes possible the specific horizon of the \"whither\" of \nbelonging-somewhere regionally. The self-directive discovery of a region is \ngrounded in an ecstatically retentive awaiting of the \"hither\" and \n\"thither\" that are possible. Making room for oneself is a directional \nawaiting of a region, and as such it is equiprimordially a bringing-close \n369 \n(de-severing*) of the ready-to-hand and present-at-hand. Out of the \nregion that has been discovered beforehand, concern comes back de\u00ad\nseverantly to that which is closest. Both bringing-close and the estimating \nand measurement of distances within that which has been de-severed and \nis present-at-hand within-the-world, are grounded in a making-present \nbelonging to the unity of that temporality in which directionality too \nbecomes possible. \nBecause Dasein as temporality is ecstatico-horizonal in its Being, it can \ntake along with it a space for which it has made room, and it can do so \nfactically and constantly. With regard to that space which it has ecstati\u00ad\ncally taken in, the \"here\" of its current factical situation [Lage bzw. \nSituation] never signifies a position in space, but signifies rather the \nleeway of the range of that equipmental totality with which it is most \nclosely concerned-a leeway which has been opened up for it in direc\u00ad\ntionality and de-severance. \nBringing-close makes possible the kind of handling and Being-busy \nwhich is 'absorbed in the thing one is handling' [\"in der Sache aufge\u00ad\nhende\"] ; and in such bringing-close, the essential structure of care\u00ad\nfalling-makes itself known. In falling, and therefore also in the bringing\u00ad\nclose which is founded 'in the present', the forgetting which awaits, leaps \nafter the Present; this is what is distinctive in the existential-temporal \n"

So while our analysis of how the 'time' of within-time-ness \nhas its source in temporality will be deferred until the next chapter,Ul it \nwould be easy to put this before our discussion of the connection between \nhistoricality and temporality.

However, can Dasein be past at all, if we define 'past' as \n'now no longer either present-at-hand or ready-to-hand' ?  Manifestly, Dasein can \nnever be past, not because Dasein is non-transient, but because it essentiaily \ncan never be present-at-hand. Rather, if it is, it exists. A Dasein which no \nlonger exists, however, is not past, in the ontologically strict sense; it is \nrather \"having-been-there\" [da-gewesen]. The antiquities which are still \npresent-at-hand have a character of 'the past' and of history by reason of \nthe fact that they have belonged as equipment to a world that has been\u00ad\nthe world of a Dasein that has been there-and that they have been \nderived from that world. This Dasein is what is primarily historical. But \ndoes Dasein first become historical in that it is no longer there ? Or is it not \nhistorical precisely in so far as it factically exists ? Is Dasein just something \nthat \"has been\" in the sense of \"having been there\", or has it been as something \nfutural which is making present-that is to say, in the temporali;:.ing of its temporality? \nFrom this provisional analysis of equipment which belongs to history \nand which is still present-at-hand though somehow 'past', it becomes \nplain that such entities are historical only by reason of their belonging to \nthe world. But the world has an historical kind of Being because it makes \n1 'Vergiinglichkeit'. Cf. 'vergehen' ('to pass away') and 'Vergangenheit' ('the past'). \n11 'Welt ist nur in der Weise des existierenden Daseins, das als In-der-Welt-seinfaktisch ist.' \n"

No one \ndenies that at bottom human Dasein is the primary 'subject' of history ; \nand the ordinary conception of history, which we have cited, says so \nplainly enough.

We must \nnow justify this thesis, with the aim of expounding the ontological problem \nof history as an existential one. The Being of Dasein has been defined \nas care. Care is grounded in temporality. Within the range of temporality, \ntherefore, the kind of historizing which gives existence its definitely \nhistorical character, must be sought. Thus the Interpretation of Dasein's \nhistoricality will prove to be, at bottom, just a more concrete working out \nof temporality. We first revealed temporality with regard to that way of \nexisting authentically which we characterized as anticipatory resolute\u00b7 \nness. How far does this imply an authentic historizing of Dasein? \nWe have defined \"resoluteness\" as a projecting of oneself upon one's \nown Being-guilty-a projecting which is reticent and ready for anxiety.iv \nResoluteness gains its authenticity as anticipatory resoluteness.v In this, \nDasein understands itself with regard to its potentiality-for-Being, and it \ndoes so in such a manner that it will go right under the eyes of Death in \norder thus to take over in its thrownness that entity which it is itself, and \nto take it over wholly. The resolute taking over of one's factical 'there', \nsignifies, at the same time, that the Situation is one which has been \n383 \nresolved upon. In the existential analysis we cannot, in principle, discuss \nwhat Dasein factically resolves in any particular case. Our investigation \nexcludes even the existential projection of the factical possibilities of \nexistence. Nevertheless, we must ask whence, in general, Dasein can draw \nthose possibilities upon which it factically projects itself. One's anticipa\u00ad\ntory projection of oneself on that possibility of existence which is not to be \noutstripped-on death-guarantees only the totality and authenticity of \none's resoluteness. But those possibilities of existence which have been \nfactically disclosed are not to be gathered from death. And this is still less \nthe case when one's anticipation of this possibility does not signify that \none is speculating about it, but signifies precisely that one is coming back \nto one's factical \"there\". Will taking over the thrownness of the Self into \nits world perhaps disclose an horizon from which existence snatches its \nfactical possibilities away ?1 Have we not said in addition that Dasein \nnever comes back behind its thrownness ?vi Before we decide too quickly \n1 'Soil etwa die Obemahme der Geworfenheit des Selbst in seine Welt einen Horizont \nerschliesen, dem die Existenz ihre faktischen Moglichkeiten entreisst?' \n"

As thrown, it has been \nsubmitted to a 'world', and exists factically with Others. Proximally and \nfor the most part the Self is lost in the \"they\". It understands itself in \nterms of those possibilities of existence which 'circulate' in the 'average' \npublic way of interpreting Dasein today. These possibilities have mostly \nbeen made unrecognizable by ambiguity; yet they are well known to us. \nThe authentic existentiell understanding is so far from extricating itself \nfrom the way of interpreting Dasein which has come down to us, that in \neach case it is in terms of this interpretation, against it, and yet again for \nit, that any possibility one has chosen is seized upon in one's resolution. \nThe resoluteness in which Dasein comes back to itself, discloses current \nfactical possibilities of authentic existing, and discloses them in terms of the \nheritage which that resoluteness, as thrown, takes over. In one's coming back \nresolutely to one's thrownness, there is hidden a handing down to oneself of \nthe possibilities that have come down to one, but not necessarily as having \nthus come down. 1 If everything 'good' is a heritage, and the character of \n'goodness' lies in making authentic existence possible, then the handing \ndown of a heritage constitutes itself in resoluteness. The more authentically \n384 \nDasein resolves-and this means that in anticipating death it understands \nitself unambiguously in terms of its ownmost distinctive possibility-the \nmore unequivocally does it choose and find the possibility of its existence, \nand the less does it do so by accident. Only by the anticipation of death \nis every accidental and 'provisional' possibility driven out. Only Being-\nfree for death, gives Dasein its goal outright and pushes existence into \nits finitude. Once one has grasped the finitude of one's existence, it \nsnatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities which offer \nthemselves as closest to one-those of comfortableness, shirking, and \ntaking things lightly-and brings Dasein into the simplicity of its fate \n[Schicksals]. This is how we designate Dasein's primordial historizing, \nwhich lies in authentic resoluteness and in which Dasein hands itself \ndown to itself, free for death, in a possibility which it has inherited and \nyet has chosen. \n1 'Die Entschlossenheit, in der das Dasein auf sich selbst zurickkommt, erschliest die \njeweiligen faktischen Miiglichkeiten eigentlichen Existierens f!US dem Erbe, .das. sie \u009c \ngeworfene iibemimmt.

The resoluteness which comes back to itself and \nhands itself down, then becomes the repetition of a possibility of existence \nthat has come down to us. Repeating is handing down explicit[y-that is to \nsay, going back into the possibilities of the Dasein that has-been-there.1 \nThe authentic repetition of a possibility of existence that has been-the \npossibility that Dasein may choose its hero-is grounded existentially in \nanticipatory resoluteness; for it is in resoluteness that one first chooses the \nchoice which makes one free for the struggle of loyally following in the \nfootsteps of that which can be repeated. But when one has, by repetition, \nhanded down to oneself a possibility that has been, the Dasein that has\u00ad\nbeen-there is not disclosed in order to be actualized over again. The \nrepeating of that which is possible does not bring again [Wiederbringen] \nsomething that is 'past', nor does it bind the 'Present' back to that which \ng86 \nhas already been 'outstripped'.

(In the earlier editions the article 'Die', as well as \nthe words now italicized, appears in spaced type.) \nWhile we usually translate 'wiederholen' as 'repeat', this English word is hardly \nadequate to express Heidegger's meaning. Etymologically, 'wiederholen' means 'to fetch \nagain'; in modem German usage, however, this, is expressed by the cognate separable \nverb 'wieder . . .  holen', while 'wiederholen' means simply 'to repeat' or 'do over again'. \nHeidegger departs from both these meanings, as ,he is careful to point out. For him, \n'wiederholen' does not mean either a mere mechanical r\u0130petition or an attempt to recon\u00ad\nstitute the physical past; it means rather an attempt to go back to the past and retrieve \nformer possibilities, which are thus 'explicitly handed down' or 'transmitted'. \n"

In the moment \nof vision authentic existence is indifferent to both these alternatives. \nWe characterize repetition as a mode of that resoluteness which hands \nitself down-the mode by which Dasein exists explicitly as fate. But if \nfate constitutes the primordial historicality of Dasein, then history has its \nessential importance neither in what is past nor in the \"today\" and its \n'connection' with what is past, but in that authentic historizing of existence \nwhich arises from Dasein'sfuture. As a way of Being for Dasein, history has \nits roots so essentially in the future that death, as that possibility ofDasein \nwhich we have already characterized, throws anticipatory existence back \nupon its factical thrownness, and so for the first time imparts to having\u00ad\nbeen its peculiarly privileged position in the historical. Authentic Being\u00ad\ntowards-death-that is to say, the finitude of temporality-is the hidden basis of \nDasein's historicality. Dasein does not first become historical in repetition ; \nbut because it is historical as temporal, it can take itself over in its history \nby repeating. For this, no historiology is as yet needed. \nResoluteness implies handing oneself down by anticipation to the \n\"there\" of the moment of vision; and this handing down we call \"fate\". \nThis is also the ground for destiny, by which we understand Dasein's \nhistorizing in Being-with Others. In repetition, fateful destiny can be dis\u00ad\nclosed explicitly as bound up with the heritage which has come down to us. \nBy repetition, Dasein first has its own history made manifest. Historizing is \nitself grounded existentially in the fact that Dasein, as temporal, is open \necstatically; so too is the disclosedness which belongs to historizing, or \nrather so too is the way in which we make this disclosedness our own. \nThat which we have hitherto been characterizing as \"historicality\" to \nconform with the kind of historizing which lies in anticipatory resolute\u00ad\nness, we now designate as Dasein's \"authentic historicality\".

The idea \nseems to be that in resolute repetition one is having, as it were, a conversation with the \npast, in which the past proposes certain posibilities for adoption, but in which one makes \na rejoinder to this proposal by 'reciprocating' with the proposal of other possibilities as a \nsort of rebuke to the past, which one now disavows.

The possibility that this horizon for the question \nshould be the dominant one is grounded in the irresoluteness which goes \nto make up the essence of the Self's in-constancy. \nWe have thus pointed out the source of the question of the 'connected\u00ad\nness' of Daein in the sense of the unity with which Experiences are \nlinked together between birth and death. At the same time, the origin of \nthis question betrays that it is an inappropriate one if we are aiming at a \nprimordial existential Interpretation of Dasein's totality of historizing. On \nthe other hand, despite the predominance of this 'natural' horizon for such \nquestions, it becomes explicable why Dasein's authentic historicality\u00ad\nfate and repetition-looks as if it, least of all, could supply the phenomenal \nbasis for bringing into the shape of an ontologically grounded problem \nwhat is at bottom intended in the question of the 'connectedness' oflife. \nThis question does not ask how Dasein gains such a unity of connected\u00ad\nness that the sequence of 'Experiences' which has ensued and is still \nensuing can subsequently be linked together ; it asks rather in which of its \nown kinds of Being Dasein loses itself in such a manner1 that it must, as it were, \nonly subsequently pull itself together out of its dispersal, and think up for itself a \nuniry in which that \"together\" is embraced. Our lostness in the \"they\" and in \nthe world-historical has earlier been revealed as a fleeing in the face of \ndeath. Such fleeing makes manifest that Being-towards-death is a basic \nattribute of care. Anticipatory resoluteness brings this Being-towards\u00ad\ndeath into authentic existence. The historizing of this resoluteness, \nhowever, is the repetition of the heritage of possibilities by handing these \ndown to oneself in anticipation; and we have Interpreted this historizing \nas authentic historicality. Is perhaps the whole of existence stretched \nalong in this historicality in a way which is primordial and not lost, and \nwhich has no need of connectedness ? The Self's resoluteness against the \ninconstancy of distraction, is in itself a steadiness which has been stretched along \n-the steadiness with which Dasein as fate 'incorporates' into its existence \n39 I \nbirth and death and their 'between', and holds them as thus 'incorpor\u00ad\nated', so that in such constancy Dasein is indeed in a moment of vision for \nwhat is world-historical in its current Situation. 2 In the fateful repetition \n1 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n verliert es sich so \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n ' The older editions have ' . . .  verliert des sich nicht so \u2022\n.\n\u2022\n \n' \n2 'Die Entschlossenheit des Selbst gegen die Unstiindigkeit der Zerstreuung ist in sich \nselbst die erstreckte Stiitigkeit, in der das Dasein als Schicksal Geburt und Tod in ihr \n\"Zwischen\" in seine Existenz \"einbezogen\" halt, so zwar, dass es in solcher Stiindigkeit \naugcnblicklich ist fur das Welt-geschichtliche seiner jeweiligen Situation.'

      "full_text": "II. 5 \nBeing and Tim \n443 \nof possibilities that have been, Dasein brings itself back 'immediately'\u00ad\nthat is to say, in a way that is temporally ecstatical-to what already has \nbeen before it. But when its heritage is thus handed down to itself, its \n'birth' is caught up into its existence in coming back from the possibility of \ndeath (the possibility which is not to be outstripped), if only so that this \nexistence may accept the thrownness of its own \"there\" in a way which is \nmore free from Illusion. I \nResoluteness constitutes the loyal9J of existence to its own Self. As \nresoluteness which is ready for anxie9J, this loyalty is at the same time a \npossible way of revering the sole authority which a free existing can have \n-of revering the repeatable possibilities of existence. Resoluteness would \nbe misunderstood ontologically if one were to suppose that it would be \nactual as 'Experience' only as long as the 'act' of resolving 'lasts'. In \nresoluteness lies the existentiell constancy which, by its very essence, has \nalready anticipated [ vorweggenommen] every possible moment of vision \nthat may arise from it. As fate, resoluteness is freedom to give up some \ndefinite resolution, and to give it up in accordance with the demands of \nsome possible Situation or other. The steadiness of.existence is not inter\u00ad\nrupted thereby but confirmed in the moment of vision. This steadiness is \nnot first formed either through or by the adjoining of 'moments' one to \nanother ; but these arise from the temporality of that repetition which is \nfuturally in the process-of-having-been-a temporality which has already \nbeen stretehed along. \nIn inauthentic historicality, on the other hand, the way in which fate \nhas been primordially stretched along has been hidden. With the incon\u00ad\nstancy of the they-self Dasein makes present its 'today\u2022. In awaiting the \nnext new thing, it has already forgotten the old one. The \"they\" evades \nchoice. Blind for possibilities, it cannot repeat what has been, but only \nretains and receives the 'actual\u2022 that is left over, the world-historical that \nhas been, the leavings, and the information about them that is present\u00ad\nat-hand. Lost in the making present of the \"today\", it understands the \n'past' in terms of the 'Present\u2022. On the other hand, the temporality of \nauthentic historicality, as the moment of vision of anticipatory repetition, \n'Stitigkeit', which we here translate as 'steadines', may mean either 'continuity' or \n'refractoriness'. Heidegger may have both senses in mind. Cf. our note g, p. 475, H. 423 \nbelow. \n1 'Mit diesem Sichiiberliefem des Erbes aber ist dann die \"Geburt\" im Zurickkommen \naus der uniiberholbaren Mt>glichkeit des Todes in die Existent tinge/wit, damit diese \ntteilich nur die Geworfenheit des eigenen Da illusionsfreier hinnehme.' Here as in H. 307 \nand perhaps in H. 302, Heidegger seems to be exploiting the double meaning of 'ein\u00ad\nholen' as 'to bring in' and 'to catch up with'. Dasem 'brings' its birth 'into' its existence \nby accepting its heritage of possibilities, and in this way it 'catches up with it'. Thus while \ndeath cannot be outstripped ('iiberholt'), birth can at least be 'caught up with' ('einge\u00ad\nholt'). \n"
