That all of metaphysics, so to speak, has been sunk in this\nopening or, if you will, paralyzed in the aporia of the exoteric discourse of Physics\nIV is still to be seen in Kant. Not only in Kant's linking of the possibility of time\nto the intuitus derivativus and to the concept of a derived finitude or passivity, but\nabove all in that which is most revolutionary and least metaphysical in his\nthought of time. This can be attributed, as you will, to the passive in Kant or\nto the active in Aristotle.

This profound metaphysical\nfidelity is organized and arranged along with the break that recognizes time as the\ncondition for the possibility of the appearance of beings in (finite) experience,\ni.e., also along with that in Kant which will be repeated by Heidegger. In principle,\ntherefore, the text of Aristotle could always be submitted to what might be called\nthe \"generous repetition,\" the repetition from which Kant profits, but which is\ndenied Aristotle and Hegel, at least at the period of Being and Time.

These exist solely\nin Being-moved or in changing-Being, and are more or less slow or rapid, which\ncannot be the case with time. On the contrary, time makes possible movement,\nchange, their measurement, and differences of speed. Here time is what defines,\nand not what is defined (218b).\n2. Nevertheless, there is no time without movement. It is\nthat Aristotle\nlinks time to experience or to appearing (dianoia, psykhe, aisthesis). If time is not\nmovement, we nevertheless caimot experience time except by feeling and de-\ntermining a change or a movement. (Aristotle asserts that here the difference\nbetween movement and change is not pertinent and should not detain him\u2014\n218b.) \"Therefore it is clear that time neither is movement nor exists without it\"\n(219a).\nWhat is it then that relates time to what it is not, that is, to movement? What\nin movement determines time? One must seek in time ti t\u00ebs kineseOs estin, that\nis, in sum, what relates time to space, and to changes of place. And one must\nfind the concepts for this relationship.\nDiscreet, advanced without insistence, as if they went without saying, the\nfundamental categories, here, are those of analogy and correspondence. They lead\nback, by other names, and barely displacing it, to the enigma of the \"at the same\ntime,\" which both names and evades, states and obscures, the problem.\nMagnitude is continuous. This is axiomatic here. Now, movement follows the\norder of magnitude, corresponds to this order (akolouthei Wi megethei he kinesis).\nTherefore it is continuous. Further, anterior and posterior are local situations\n(en topaz). As such, they are within magnitude, and therefore, according to the\ncorrespondence or the analogy of magnitude and movement (219a), they are also\nwithin movement. And within time, since \"time and movement always corre-\nspond to each other\" (dia to akolouthein aei thateroi thateron aut\u00f6n). It follows,\nfinally, that time is continuous by analogy with movement and magnitude.\nThis leads to the definition of time as the number of movement following the\nbefore and the after (219ab). A definition made more specific, as is well known,\nby the distinction between the numbered number and the numbering number.

Thus,\none studies space, determines its nature and function, and then transports the conclusions\nthus obtained onto time. The theory of space and the theory of time thus become sym-\nmetrical.

It is\nas foreign to number itself, to the numbering number, as horses and men are\ndifferent from the numbers that count them, and different from each other.

It lets itself be numbered\nonly insofar as it has a relation to movement according to the before and after.\nThe unity of the measure of time numbered in this way is the now, which\npernuts the distinction between before and after. And it is because movement\nis determined according to the before and the after that the graphic linear rep-\nresentation of time is simultaneously required and exduded by Aristotle. This\ndetermination according to the anterior and the posterior \"corresponds,\" in\neffect, \"in a certain manner to the point\" (akolouthei de kai touto pos t\u00eai stigmei).\nThe point gives to length its continuity and its limit. The line is a continuity of\npoints. And each point is both an end and a beginning (arkh\u00eb kai teleuf\u00eb) for each\npart. Thus, one could be led to believe that the now is to time what the point\nis to the line. And that the essence of time can pass, intact and undamaged,\ninto its linear representation, into the continuous, extended unfolding of punc-\ntuality.\nAristotle firmly indicates that this is not so. The spatial and linear represen-\ntation, at least in this form, is inadequate. What is criticized, thereby, is not the\nrelationship of time to movement, nor the numbered or numerable Being of\ntime, but rather time's analogy with a certain structure of the gramme.\nIn effect, if one uses the point and the line to represent movement, one is\nmanipulating a multiplicity of points which are both origin and limit, beginning\nand end; this multiplicity of immobilities, this series (if it can be called such),\nof successive arrests, does not give time, and when Aristotle recalls this, his\nlanguage is indistinguishable from Bergson's:\". . . for the point both connects\nand limits the length\u2014it is the beginning of one and the end of another. But if\nyou consider the one point as two, an arrest or pause is necessary, if the same\npoint is to be both beginning and end\" (220a).\nIn this sense, the now is not the point, since it does not arrest time, is neither\ntime's origin, end, or limit. At least it is not a limit to the extent that it belongs\nto time. The importance of the to the extent that henceforth will become more\nspecific, and will do so unceasingly.\nWhat is rejected, then, is not the gramme as such, but the gramme as a series\nof points, as a composition of parts each of which would be an arrested limit.\nBut if one considers now that the point, as limit, does not exist in act, is not\n(present), exists only potentially and by accident, takes its existence only from\n59\n"

Only such a reading, on the condition that it does not give authority to the security\nor structural dosing off of questions, appears to us capable of undoing today, in France,\na profound complicity: the complicity which gathers together, in the same refusal to read,\nin the same denegation of the question, of the text, and of the question of the text, in the\nsame reeditions, or in the same blind silence, the camp of Heideggerian devotion and the\ncamp of anti-Heideggerianism.

      "full_text": "The Pit and the Pyramid\nThe theory of the signs belongs to the third moment, to the third part, of the\nphilosophy of spirit. It belongs to the science of the moment when the idea\ncomes back to itself after having, if we may put it thus, lost awareness, lost the\nconsciousness and meaning of itself in nature, in its Being-other. The sign, then,\nwill be an agency or essential structure of the Idea's return to self-presence. If\nspirit is the Idea's Being-near-to-itself, one already may identify the sign by its\nfirst, most general determination: the sign is a form or a movement of the Idea's\nrelation to itself in the element of spirit, a mode of the absolute's Being-near-to-\nitself.\nLet us narrow our angle of vision. Let us situate the theory of the sign more\nprecisely in the philosophy of spirit. The latter itself is articulated in three parts\nwhich correspond to the three movements of the development of spirit:\n1. Subjective spirit: the spirit's relation to itself, an only ideal totality of the\nIdea. This is Being-near-to-itself in the form of\nfreedom.\n2. Objective spirit, as a world to produce and produced in the form of reality,\nnot only ideality. Freedom here becomes an existing, present necessity (vor-\nhandene Notwendigkeit).\n3. Absolute spirit: the unity, that is in itself and for itself, of the objectivity of\nthe spirit and of its ideality or its concept, the unity producing itself eternally,\nspirit in its absolute truth\u2014absolute spirit (sec. 385, p. 20).\nThe first two moments, then, are finite and transitory determinations of spirit.\nNow, the discourse on the sign derives from the science of one of these finite\ndeterminations: subjective spirit. If one recalls that, according to Hegel, \"the\nfinite is not, i.e., is not the truth, but merely a transition (Ubergegen) and an\nemergence (Ubersichhinausgehen: a transgression of itself)\" (sec. 386, p. 23), then\nthe sign indeed appears as a mode or determination of subjective and finite\nspirit as a mediation or transgression of itself, a transition within the transition,\na transition of the transition. But this way out of itself is the obligatory route of\na return to itself. It is conceived under the jurisdiction and in the form of\ndialectics, according to the movement of the true, and is watched over by the\nconcepts of Aufhebung and negativity. \"This finitude of the spheres so far ex-\namined is the dialectic that makes a thing have its cessation ( Vergehen) by another\nand in another\" (p. 23).\nLet us define the place of this semiology more closely. Subjective spirit itself\nis:\n1. in itself or immediate: this is the soul or natural-spirit (Natur-Geist), the object\nof the anthropology that studies man in nature;\n2. for itself or mediate, as an identical reflection in itself and in the other, spirit\nin relation or particularization (im Verh\u00e4ltnis oder Besonderung), consciousness, the\nobject of the phenomenology of spirit;\n3. spirit determining itself in itself, as a subject for itself, the object of psychology\n(sec. 387, p. 25).\n74\n"

Let us note, nevertheless\u2014although this cannot\ndetain us here\u2014that semiology, as part of the science of the subject which is for\nitself, does not belong to the science of consciousness, that is, to phenomenology.\nThis topical scheme, which inscribes semiology in a non-natural science of the\nsoul, and properly in a psychology, in no way upsets a long traditional sequence,\nor at least does not do so in this way. The topical arrangement not only takes\nus back to the numerous semiological projects of the Middle Ages or the eigh-\nteenth century, which are all, directly or not, psychologi s, but also to Aristotle.\nAristotle is the model claimed by Hegel for his philosophy of spirit, and spe-\ncifically for his psychology: \"The books of Aristotle on the Soul, along with his\ndiscussions on its special aspects and states, are for this reason still by far the\nmost admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this\ntopic. The main aim of a philosophy of mind [spirit] can only be to reintroduce\nunity of idea and principle into the theory of mind, and so reinterpret the lesson\nof those Aristotelian books\" (sec. 378, p. 3).\nit is Aristotle, precisely, who developed his interpretation of the voice in a\ntreatise Pen Psukhes (which will count for us in a moment), and who, in Pen\nHernieneias, defined signs, symbols, speech and writing on the basis of the\npathemafa t\u00ebs psukhes, the states, affections or passions of the soul. Let us recall\nthe well known opening of Pen Herrneneias: \"Spoken words (ta en t\u00ebi phOnei) are\nthe symbols of mental experience and written words are the symbols of spoken\nwords. Just as all men have not the same writing so all men have not the same\nspeech sounds, but the mental experiences, which these directly symbolize [are\nsigns of in the first place: s\u00ebmeia protos] are the same for all [which is precisely\nwhat permits a science of them] as also are those things of which our experiences\nare the images. This matter has, however, been discussed in my treatise about\nthe soul.\"4\nThe traditional repetition of the gesture by means of which semiology is made\nto proceed from psychology is not only the past of Hegelianism. Often that\nwhich purports to be a surpassing of Hegelianism, and sometimes a science free\nof metaphysics, still conforms to it.\nThis necessary gesture, which is properly metaphysical and governs an entire\nconcatenation of discourses from Aristotle to 1-legel, will not be challenged by\nthe author considered as the founder of the first great project of general and\nscientific semiology, the model for so many modem, social sciences. Twice at\nleast, in the Course on Genera!

Instead of\nsubstantially separating faculties and psychic structures, then, one must deter-\nmine their mediations, articulations, and joinings, which constitute the unity\nof an organized and oriented movement. Now it is remarkable that the theory\nof the sign, which essentially consists of an interpretation of speech and writing,\nis put forth in two long Remarks, remarks much longer than the paragraphs to\nwhich they are affixed, in the subchapter \"Imagination\" (Die Einbildungskraft,\nsecs. 445\u201460).\nSemiology, then, is a part of the theory of the imagination, and more precisely,\nas we shall specify, of a phantasiology or a fantastics.\nWhat is imagination?\nRepresentation (Vorstellung) is remembered-interiorized (erinnerte) intuition.\nIt properly belongs to intelligence (Intelligenz), whose action is to interiorize\nsensible immediacy in order \"itself to pose itself as having an intuition of itself\n(sich in sich selbst anschauend zu setzen).\" Sensible immediacy remaining uni-\nlaterally subjective, the movement of intelligence must, by Aufhebung, lift and\n5.

By means of\nErinnerung the content of sensible intuition becomes an image, freeing itself from\nimmediacy and singularity in order to permit the passage to conceptuality. The\nimage thus interiorized in memory (erinnert) is no longer there, no longer existent\nor present, but preserved in an unconscious dwelling, conserved without con-\nsciousness (bewusstlos, aufbewahrt).

This synthesis of the\ninternal image with the recollected existence (erinnert'u Jasein) is representation\nproper (die eigentliche Vorstellung): by this synthesis the internal now has the\nqualification of being able to be presented before intelligence (vor die Intelligenz\ngestellt werden zu konnen) and to have its existence in it\" (sec. 454, p. 205). The\nimage no longer belongs to \"the simple night.\"7\n7. In a work in preparation on Hegel's family and on sexual difference in the dialectical\nspeculative economy, we will bring to light the organization and displacement of this chain\nwhich reassembles the values of night, sepulcher, and divine\u2014familial\u2014feminine law as\nthe law of singularity\u2014and does so around the pit and the pyramid. A citation as a\ntouchstone: \"But if the universal thus easily knocks off the very tip of the pyramid (die\nreme Spitze seiner Pyrarnide) and, indeed, carries off the victory over the rebellious principle\nof pure individuality, viz., the Family, it has thereby merely entered on a conflict with the\ndivine law, a conflict of self-conscious Spirit with what is unconscious. For the latter is the\nother essential power, and is therefore not destroyed, but merely wronged (beleidigt) by\nthe conscious Spirit. But it has pnly the bloodless shade to help it in actually carrying out\nits law in face of the power and authority of that other, publicly manifest law. Being the\nlaw of weakness and darkness it therefore at first succumbs to the powerful law of the\nupper world, for the power of the former is effective in the underworld, not on earth.\"\nHegel, Phenoinenotogy of Spirit, trans.

      "full_text": "The Pit and the Pyramid\nHegel evidently defines it as an ideality, in opposition to the corporality of an\nintuitive signifier. This ideality is that of a Bedeutung. This word is usually trans-\nlated as \"signification.\" Having attempted, in commenting elsewhere upon the\nLogical Researches,'\u00b0 to interpret it as the content of a meaning, I would like to\ndemonstrate here that such an interpretation is also valid for the Hegelian text.\nSuch an extension is regulated by an internal and essential metaphysical ne-\ncessity.\nHegel accords to the content of this meaning, this Bedeutung, the name and\nrank of soul (Seele). Of course it is a soul deposited in a body, in the body of the\nsignifier, in the sensory flesh of intuition. The sign, as the unity of the signifying\nbody and the signified ideality, becomes a kind of incarnation. Therefore the\nopposition of soul and body, and analogically the opposition of the intelligible\nand the sensory, condition the difference between the signified and the signifier,\nbetween the signifying intention (bedeuten), which is an-animating activity, and\nthe inert body of the signifier. This will remain true for Saussure; and also for\nHusserl, who sees the body of the sign as animated by the intention of signi-\nfication, just as a body (K\u00f6rper) when inhabited by Geist becomes a proper body\n(Leib). Husserl says of the living word that it is a geistige' Leiblichkeit, a spiritual\nflesh.\nHegel knew that this proper and animated body of the signifier was also a\ntomb. The association s\u00f6ma/s\u00ebma is also at work in this semiology, which is in no\nway\nThe tomb is the life of the body as the sign of death, the body\nas the other of the soul, the other of the animate psyche, of the living breath.\nBut the tomb also shelters, maintains in reserve, capitalizes on life by marking\nthat life continues elsewhere. The family crypt: oikfsis.'2 It consecrates the dis-\nappearance of life by attesting to the perseverance of life. Thus, the tomb also\nshelters life from death. It warns the soul of possible death, warns (of) death of\nthe soul, turns away (from) death. This double warning function belongs to the\nfunerary monument. The body of the sign thus becomes the monument in which\nthe soul will be enclosed, preserved, maintained, kept in maintenance, present,\n10. TN. See Derrida, Speech and Phenomena, for this argument.\n11. P. Hochart\u2014my thanks to him here\u2014since then has directed my attention to the\nfollowing passage from the Cratylus, a passage less frequently cited and more interesting\nfor us than the celebrated text of the Gorgias (493a) on the couple sOrna/s\u00ebma. \"Socrates:\nYou mean 'body' (soma)?\u2014Hermogenes: Yes.\u2014Soc.: I think this admits of many expla-\nnations, if a little, even very little, change is made; for some say it is the toni!.' (s\u00eb,na) of\nthe soul, their notion being that the soul is buried in present life; and again, because by\nits means the soul gives any signs which it gives (s\u00ebmainei ha an\nnC psukhei), it is\nfor this also properly called 'sign' (s\u00ebma). But I think it most likely that the Orphic poets\ngave this name, with the Idea that the soul is undergoing punishment for something; they\nthink it has the body for an enclosure to keep it safe, like a prison, and this is, as the\nname itself denotes, the safe (sown, prison) for the soul until the penalty is paid, and not\neven a letter needs to be changed.\" Plato, Collected Works in Twelve Volunzes, vol. 4 (Cam-\nbridge: Harvard University Press, 1926), p. 63.\n12.

At the heart of this monument the soul keeps itself alive, but it needs\nthe monument only to the extent that it is exposed\u2014to death\u2014in its living\nrelation to its own body. It was indeed necessary for death to be at work\u2014the\nPhenomenology of the Spirit describes the work of death\u2014for a monument to come\nto retain and protect the life of the soul by signifying it.\nThe sign\u2014the monument-of-Life-in-death, the monument-of-death-rn-life, the\nsepulcher of a soul or of an embalmed proper body, the height conserving in\nits depths the hegemony of the soul, resisting time, the hard text of stones\ncovered with inscription\u2014is the pyramid.\nHegel, then, uses the word pyramid to designate the sign. The pyramid be-\ncomes the semaphor of the sign, the signifier of signification. Which is not an\nindifferent fact. Notably as concerns the Egyptian connotation: further on, the\nEgyptian hieroglyphic will furnish the example of that which resists the move-\nment of dialectics, history and logos. Is this contradictory?\nFirst, let us assist at the erection of the pyramid.\n\"In this unity (initiated by intelligence) of an independent representation\n(selbstandiger Vorstellung) with an intuition, the matter of the latter is, in the first\ninstance, something accepted (em\nAufgenommenes), something immediate or\ngiven (for example, the color of the cockade, etc.). But in the fusion of the two\nelements, the intuition does not count positively or as representing itself, but\nas representative of something else\" (sec. 458, p. 212).\nThus we have, for once, a kind of intuition of absence, or more precisely the\nsighting of an absence through a full intuition.\n\"It [this intuition) is an image, which has received [in sic!: empfangen hat: has\nreceived, welcomed, conceived, as a woman would conceive by receiving; and\nwhat is conceived here is indeed a concept] as its soul and meaning an independent\nmental representation, its signification (Bedeutung). This intuition is the Sign\"\n(sec. 458, p. 213).\nThere follows one of the two Remarks which contain the entire theory of the\nsign (which will not prevent Hegel, later, from cirticizing those who grant sem-\niology only the site and status of an appendix). \"The sign is some immediate\nintuition, representing a totally different import from what naturally belongs to\nit (die einen ganz anderen Inhalt vorstellt, als den sie f\u00fcr sic!: hat\" (ibid.). Vorstellen,\nwhich is generally translated as \"to represent,\" whether in the vaguest sense\nof intellectual or psychic representation, or in the sense of the representation\nof an object that is put forth to be seen, here also marks the representative detour,\nthe recourse to what represents, to what is put in the place of the other, the\ndelegate of and reference to the other. Here, an intuition is mandated to rep-\nresent, in its proper content, an entirely other content. \"The sign is some im-\nmediate intuition, representing a totally different import from what naturally\nbelongs to it; it is the pyramid [Hegel's emphasis) into which a foreign soul (eine\nfremde Seele) has been conveyed [transposed, transplanted, translated: versetzt;\nversetzten is also to place on deposit; in: Leihause z'ersetzten: to place in the pawn-\n83\n"

Hegel emphasizes this het-\nerogeneity, the condition for the arbitrariness of the sign, twice.\n1. The soul consigned to the pyramid is foreign (fremd). If it is transposed,\ntransplanted into the monument like an immigrant, it is that it is not made of\nthe stone of the signifier; neither in its origin nor its destination does it belong\nto the matter of the intuitive given. This heterogeneity amounts to the irreduc-\nibility of the soul and the body, of the intelligible and the sensory, of the concept\nor signified ideality on the one hand, and of the signifying body on the other,\nthat is, in different senses, the irreducibility of two representations (Vorstellungen).\n2. This is why the immediate intuition of the signifier represents an entirely\nother content (einen ganz anderen Inhalt) than that which it has for itself, entirely\nother than that whose full presence refers only to itself.\nThis relationship of absolute alterity distinguishes the sign from the symbol.\nThe continuity of a mimetic or analogical participation can always be seen be-\ntween the symbol and the symbolized. \"The sign is different from the symbol:\nfor in the symbol the original characters (in essence and conception) of the visible\nobject are more or less identical with the import which it bears as symbol;\nwhereas in the sign, strictly so-called, the natural attributes of the intuition, and\nthe connotation of which it is a sign, have nothing to do with one another\"\n(ibid.).\nThe motif of the arbitrariness of the sign, the distinction between sign and\nsymbol, is clarified at length in the \"Introduction\" to the section of the Aesthetics\ndevoted to \"Symbolic Art.\" There, Hegel specifies the \"purely arbitrary linkage\"\n(ganz willkurliche Verknupfung) which constitutes the sign itself, and above all the\nlinguistic sign. \"Therefore it is a different thing when a sign is to be a symbol.\nThe lion, for example, is taken as a symbol of magnanimity, the fox of cunning,\nthe circle of eternity, the triangle of Trinity. But the lion and the fox do possess\nin themselves the very qualities whose significance (Bedeutung) they are sup-\nposed to express. Similarly the circle does not exhibit the endlessness or the\ncapricious limitation of a straight or other line, which does not return into itself,\na limitation likewise appropriate enough for some limited space of time; and the\ntriangle as a whole has the same number of sides and angles as that appearing\nin the idea of God when the determinations which religion apprehends in God\nare liable to numeration.\n84\n"

The\nPyramids are such an external environment in which an inner meaning rests\nconcealed\" (Aesth. I, p. 356).\nThis requisite discontinuity between the signified and the signifier coincides\nwith the systemic necessity that includes semiology in a psychology. It will be\nrecalled, in effect, that psychology\u2014.in the Hegelian sense\u2014is the science of the\nspirit determining itself in itself, as a subject for itself. This is the moment at\nwhich \"all [spirit] now has to do is to realize the notion of its freedom\" (Ency-\nclopedia, sec. 440, p. 179). This is why it was indispensable, above, to assert the\narchitectonic articulation between psychology and semiology. This allows us\nbetter to comprehend the meaning of arbitrariness: the production of arbitrary\nsigns manifests the freedom of the spirit. And there is more 'manifest freedom\nin the production of the sign than in the production of the symbol. In the sign\nspirit is more independent and closer to itself. In the symbol, conversely, it is\na bit more exiled into nature. \"Intelligence therefore gives proof of wider choice\n(Willkur) and ampler authority (Herrschaft) in the use of intuitions when it treats\nthem as designatory (als bezeichnend) rather than as symbolical (als symbolisierend)\"\n(Enc. sec. 458, p. 213)14\nAccording to the framework of this teleology, the semiotic instance, just de-\nfined as abstract rationality, also helps impel the manifestation of freedom. Hence\nits essential place in the development of psychology and logic. Hegel marks this\nplace accessorily, in the middle of the Remark added as a long appendix to the\nshort paragraph that defines the sign. The pyramid had emerged in this space\nand along the detour of this digression: \"In logic and psychology, signs and\nlanguage are usually foisted in somewhere as an appendix (Anhang: supplement,\n14. Hegel already inherited this opposition of sign and symbol and the teleology which\nsystematically orients it. This could be easily demonstrated on the basis of each of the\nconcepts that enter into play here. But after Hegel the same opposition and the same\nteleology maintain their authority. For example in the Course in General Linguistics. In the\nfirst chapter of the first part in the section entitled: \"Principle I: The Arbitrary Nature of\nthe Sign\" one may read: \"Signs that are wholly arbitrary realize better than the others the\nideal of the semiological process; that is why language, the most complex and universal\nof all systems of expression, is also the most characteristic; in this sense linguistics can\nbecome the master-pattern for all branches of semiology although language is only one\nparticular semiological system.\" [We will soon find the same proposition in 1-legel, at the\nmoment when he grants preeminence to the linguistic sign, to speech and the name.]\n\"The word symbol has been used to designate the linguistic sign, or more specifically, what\nis here called the signifier. Principle I in particular weighs against the use of this term.\nOne characteristic of the symbol is that it is never wholly arbitrary; it is not empty, for\nthere is the rudiment of a natural bond between the signifier and the signified. The symbol\nof justice, a pair of scales, could not be replaced by just another symbol, such as a chariot\"\n(Course, p. 68).\n86\n"

We will now examine this relationship\nbetween a certain movement of idealizing interiorization and the process of\ntemporalization. In the production of signs, memory and imagination (that is,\ntime, in this context) are the same interiorization of the spirit relating itself to\nitself in the pure intuition of itself, and therefore in its freedom, and bringing\nthis intuition of itself to exterior existence.\nWhich calls for two comments.\n1. Appearing in the Encyclopedia under the heading of imagination, the theory\nof signs is immediately followed by the chapter on memory. In the Philosophical\nPro pedeutics the same semiological content is inscribed under the rubric of mem-\nory.15\n2. Memory, the production of signs, is also thought itself. In a transitional\nremark between the chapter devoted to memory and the chapter devoted to\nthought, Hegel recalls that the \"German language has etymologically assigned\nmemory (Gedachtnis), of which it has become a foregone conclusion to speak\ncontemptuously, the high position of direct kindred with thought (Gedanke)\"\n(Enc., sec. 464, p. 223).\n15. In the \"Philosophical Encyclopedia\" of the Propedeutics (first section of the \"Science\nof Spirit,\" chapter on representation, subchapter on memory) we find again the following\ndefinitions: \"1. The sign in general. Representation having been liberated from present\nexternal reality and rendered subjective, this reality and the internal representation are\nsituated one facing the other, as two distinct things. An external reality becomes a sign\nwhen it is arbitrarily associated with a representation which does not correspond to it, and\nwhich is even distinct from it in its content, such that this reality must be its representation\nor signification\" (sec. 155). \"Creative Memory therefore produces the association between\nintuition and representation, but a free association in which the preceding relationship,\nin which representation reposed upon intuition, finds itself inversed. In the association\nas effected by creative memory, the present sensuous reality has no value in itself and for\nitself, but its sole value is that conferred upon it by spirit\" (sec. 156). \"Language. The\nhighest work of creative memory is language, which is on the one hand verbal and on the\nother handwritten. Creative memory, or mnemosvn\u00eb. being the source of language, it can\nbe a question of another source only as far as what concerns the discovery of determined\nsigns. (sec. 158). Language is the disappearance of the sensuous world in its immediate\npresence, the suppression of this world, henceforth transformed into a presence which\nis a call apt to awaken an echo in every essence capable of representation\" (sec. 159).\nPhilosophische Proplideutik, in S\u00e4mtliche Werke, vol. 3 (Stuttgart: Frommans Verlag), pp.\n209\u201410.\n87\n"

It is within this teleology that the decisive concept of phi,'sical ideality is\nto be understood. Ideality in general, in Hegelian terms, is \"the negation of the\nreal, but a negation where the real is put past, virtually retained (virfualiter\nerhalten), although it does not exist\" (sec. 403, p. 92). Since the sign is the\nnegativity which \"relifts\" (rel\u00e8ve) sensory intuition into the ideality of language,\nit must be hewn from a sensory matter which in some way is given to it, offering\na predisposed nonresistance to the work of idealization.'8 The idealizing and\n18. \"The spirit must first withdraw into itself from nature, lift itself above it, and over-\ncome it, before it can prevail in it without hindrance as in an element which cannot\nwithstand it (widerstnndslos), and transform it into a positive existence (Dasein) of its Own\nfreedom\"\nI, p. 443).\n90\n"

H, p. 808).\nCorrelatively, sight is an ideal sense, more ideal, by definition and as its name\nindicates, than touch or taste. One can also say that sight gives its sense to theory.\nIt suspends desire, lets things be, reserves or forbids their consummation.2\u00b0 The\nvisible has in common with the sign, Hegel tells us, that it cannot be eaten.\nHowever, if sight is ideal, hearing is even more so. It \"relifts\" (rel\u00e8ve) sight.\nDespite the ideality of light and vision, the objects perceived by the eye, for\nexample plastic works of art, persist beyond the perception of their sensory,\nexterior, stubborn existence; they resist the Aufhebung, and in and of themselves\ncannot be absolutely relev\u00e9 by temporal interiority. They hold back the work of\ndialectics. This being the case for plastic works of art, it certainly will be so for\nwriting as such. But not for music and speech. Hearing is the most sublime\nsense: \"Hearing. . . like sight, is one of the theoretical and not practical senses,\nand it is still more ideal than sight. For the peaceful and undesiring (begierdlose)\ncontemplation of works of art lets them remain in peace and independently as\nthey are, and there is no wish to consume or destroy them; yet what it appre-\nhends is not something inherently posited ideally, but on the contrary something\npersisting in its visible existence. The ear, on the contrary, without itself turning\nto a practical (praktisch) relation to objects, listens to the result of the inner\nvibration (inneren Erzif ferns) of the body through which what comes before us\nis no longer the peaceful and material shape, but the first and more ideal breath\nof the soul (Seelenhaftigkeit). Further, since the negativity into which the vibrating\nmaterial (schwingende Material) enters here is on one side the rel\u00e8ve (Aufheben) of\nthe spatial situation, a rel\u00e8ve relev\u00e9 again by the reaction of the body, therefore\nthe expression of this double negation, i.e. sound (Ton), is an externality which\nin its coming-to-be is annihilated again by its very existence, and it vanishes\nof itself. Owing to this double negation of externality, implicit in the principle\nof sound, inner subjectivity corresponds to it because the resounding (Klingen),\n20. The Hegelian theory of desire is the theory of the contradiction between theory and\ndesire. Theory is the death of desire, death in desire, if not the desire of death. The entire\nintroduction to the Aesthetics demonstrates this contradiction between desire (Begierde),\nwhich pushes toward consummation, and \"theoretical interest,\" which lets things be in\ntheir freedom. In the extent to which art \"is situated between pure sensuousness and pure\nthought,\" and to which \"in art the sensuous is spiritualized (vergeistigt)\" and the spirit\n\"sensualized (versinnlichf),\" art itself in a privileged way is addressed \"to the two theoretical\nsenses of sight and hearing\" (Aesth. II, p. 622). Touch is concerned only with the resistance\nof sensuous and material individuality as such; taste dissociates and consumes the object;\nwhile smell lets it evaporate. \"Sight, on the other hand, has a purely theoretical relation\nto objects (Gegenstanden) by means of light, this as it were nonmaterial matter. This for its\npart lets objects persist freely and independently; it makes them shine and appear (scheinen\nend erschejnen) but, unlike air and fire, it does not consume them in practice whether\nunnoticeably or openly. To vision, void of desire (begierdelose Sehen), everything is presented\nwhich exists materially in space as something outside everything else (Aussereinander), but\nwhich, because it remains undisturbed in its integrity, is manifest only in its shape and\ncolor\" (ibid.).\n92\n"

In the Philosophy of Nature it is at the center of the physics\nof sound (Klang); and there, as always, it marks the passage, through the op-\neration of negativity, of space into time, of the material into the ideal passing\nthrough \"abstract materiality\" (abstrakte\nThis teleological concept\nof sound as the movement of idealization, the Aufhebung of natural exteriority,\nthe rel\u00e8ve of the visible into the audible, is, along with the entire philosophy of\nnature, the fundamental presupposition of the Hegelian interpretation of lan-\n21. Elsewhere: \"The other theoretical sense is hearing. Here the opposite comes into\nview. Instead of shape, colour, etc., hearing has to do with sound (Ton), with the vibration\nof a body; here there is no process of dissolution, like that required by smell; there is\nmerely a trembling (Erzittern) of the object (Gegenstandes) which is left uninjured thereby.\nThis ideal movement in which simple subjectivity, as it were the soul of the body, is\nexpressed by its sound, is apprehended by the ear just as theoretically as the eye appre-\nhends colour or shape; and in this way the inner side of objects is made apprehensible\nby the inner life\" (Aesth. II, p. 622).\nThis hierarchical classification combines two criteria: objectivity and interiority, which\nare only apparently opposed, since idealization has as its meaning (from Plato to Husserl)\nthe simultaneous confirmation of objectivity and interiority one by the other. Ideal objec-\ntivity maintains its identity with itself, its integrity and its resistance all the more in no\nlonger depending upon an empirical sensuous exteriority. Here, the combination of the\ntwo criteria permits the elimination of touch (which is concerned only with a material\nexteriority: masterable objectivity), taste (a consummation which dissolves the object in\nthe interiority), and smell (which permits the object to dissociate itself into evaporation)\nfrom the theoretical domain. Sight is imperfectly theoretical and ideal (it lets the objectivity\nof the object be, but cannot intenorize its sensuous and spatial opaqueness). According\nto a metaphor well coordinated with the entire system of metaphysics, only hearing,\nwhich preserves both objectivity and interiority, can be called fully ideal and theoretical.\nTherefore in its eminence it is designated by optical language (idea, theOria), which permits\nus to go back to the analysis of this metaphorical system. We will attempt this elsewhere.\nHere, let us insert the following passage from the \"Rat Man\" in order to mark, with a\ndotted line, several references and several intentions: \"And here I should like to raise the\ngeneral question whether the atrophy of the sense of smell (which was an inevitable result\nof man's assumption of an erect posture) and the consequent organic repression of his\npleasure in smell may not have had a considerable share in the origin of his susceptibility\nto nervous disease. This would afford us some explanation of why, with the advance of\ncivilization, it is precisely the sexual life that must fall a victim to repression. For we have\nlong known the intimate connection between the sexual instinct and the function of the\nolfactory organ.\" Freud: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works, vol. 10\n(London: Hogarth Press, 1955), p. 248. Hegel again: \"But the objet d'art should be con-\ntemplated in its independent objectivity on its own account; true, it is there for our\napprehension but only in a theoretical and intellectual way, not in a practical one, and it\nhas no relation to desire or the will. As for smell, it cannot be an organ of artistic enjoyment\neither, because things are only available to smell in so far as they are in process and their\naroma is dissipated through the air and its practical influence\" (Aesth. H, p. 622).\n22. These propositions are explicated at length in sections 299\u2014302 of the Encyclopedia\n(\"Philosophy of\nsec. 2, Physics). See also the Philosophy of Spirit. Enc., sec. 401.\n93\n"
