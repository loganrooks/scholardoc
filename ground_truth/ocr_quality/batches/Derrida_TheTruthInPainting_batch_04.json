Consequently, contrary to what one might have thought, \nideal beauty will never give rise to a pure judgment of taste but \nto a partly intellectualized judgment of taste, comprising an idea \nof reason which determines a priori the internal possibility of the \nobject according to determinate concepts. So one cannot \"think\" \nan ideal of \"beautiful flowers,\" nor of any \"vague beauty.\" This \nis a first reply to the question: What is the beautiful in general, \nprior to the opposition between errancy and adherence? The os\u00ad\ncillation is broken, the pure is opposed to the ideal. The ideal of \nbeauty cannot give rise to a pure aesthetic judgment: the latter \ncan concern only an errancy, whereas the ideal is of adherence. \nPure beauty and ideal beauty are incompatible. So the sans of \nthe pure cut here seems to interrupt the process of idealization. \nThe yawning gap in the idealization would open onto errant beauty \nand to the event of a pure aesthetic judgment. \nBut where does this appear from? Whence does this opposition \nbetween the ideal (of the imagination) and the pure, between the \nnon-sans and the sans appear? \nFrom man. Man, equipped with a reason, an understanding, \nan imagination and a sensibility, is that X from which, with a \nview to which, the opposition is taken in view: the opposition of \nthe pure and the ideal, the errant and the adherent, the sans and \nthe non-sans, the without-end and the not-without-end, that is \nalso the opposition of non-sense and sense. The subject of that \nopposition is man and he is the only subject of this Critique of \njudgment. Only he is capable of an ideal of beauty and, from this \nideal, capable of letting the sans of the pure cut present itself. He \nis capable of this ideal of the imagination as to the things of nature \nbecause he is endowed with reason, which means, in Kantian \nlanguage, able to fix his own ends. The only being in nature to \ngive himself his own ends, to raise in himself the sans, to complete \nhimself and think from his end; he is the only one to form an \nideal of beauty, to apprehend the sans of others. He is not errant. \nHe cannot conceive of himself without goal and that is why he \nis in the full center of this point of view, the full center of a field \nwhich is nonetheless decentered and dissymmetrical. Man is not \nbetween errancy and adherence as in a middle place from which \nhe would see both of them. He is situated on one side only (ad\u00ad\nherence to self, to his own end) and from that side he puts errancy \nin perspective. \"Only what has in itself the end of its real exis\u00ad\ntence-only man that is able himself to determine his ends by \nreason, or, where he has to derive them from external perception, \n"

Here there is a parenthetical clause, which \nis very important for two reasons. Kant notes that the imagina\u00ad\ntion, the faculty of signs, can sometimes lead us back to signs of \nancient concepts, \"even very ancient ones\" (selbst von langer \nZeit). On the one hand this is the first time signs are mentioned: \nyet a whole semiotics supports the third Critique. On the other \nhand the reference to something \"very ancient\" that is accessible \nonly via signs communicates with a certain elliptical remark, \nhasarded as if in passing, in the introduction (VI): the pleasure \n(Lust) of knowing, which is no longer noticed now, \"surely existed \nin its day.\" \nAnd this pleasure is a pleasure of the same: it always stems \nfrom the mastery of the dissimilar, from the reduction of the \nheterogeneous. The agreement, conformity, coming together (Zu\u00ad\nsammentreffen) of perceptions and categories (general concepts \nof nature to which laws conform) apparently procure no pleasure. \nBut the reduction of several \"heterogeneous\" empirical laws to \none principle \"causes a very remarkable pleasure.\" And although \nthe intelligence of nature in its unity no longer necessarily pro\u00ad\ncures for us such a pleasure, this pleasure \"certainly existed in \nits day\" (aber sie ist gewiss zu ihrer Zeit gewesen), otherwise \"the \ncommonest experience would not be possible.\" It's just that this \npleasure gradually became confused with experience and was no \nlonger noticed. \nThus, although the third Critique (the place of aesthetics) \ndissociates pleasure and knowledge, although it makes of this \ndissociation a rigorous juridical frontier between taste and knowl\u00ad\nedge, the aesthetic and the logical, it must be that the pleasure \nprinciple somewhere, in a time immemorial (a concept whose \nstatus remains highly uncertain in a Critique), governed knowl\u00ad\nedge, conditioned it and accompanied it everywhere that knowl\u00ad\nedge was possible, determined it as experience (in the Kantian \nsense), thus preceding the divergence between enjoying and know\u00ad\ning. How can one situate here the time of this arche-pleasure \nwelding the imagination (aesthetic) to the understanding (logical)? \nThe aesthetic norm-idea-to which no individual is ade\u00ad\nquate-forms the empirical canon of human beauty: an average \ntype analogous to the average height that would be derived from \nthousands of individual images in order to construct \"the stature \nof a beautiful man.\" This type varies with empirical conditions, \nit differs for a \"negro,\" a \"white,\" or a \"Chinese.\" The same applies \n"

Not an archetype of \nbeauty but the form and the condition of beauty for a species. In \nthe case of the human face, this regulatory type, which is never \nbeautiful in itself, ordinarily lacks expression and reveals a man \nof \"mediocre inner value,\" if, that is, adds Kant, one admits that \nnature carries the internal proportions to the outside. And he is \nquite ready to admit it. What is more, in this system he cannot \nbut admit it. We shall verify this. For example, if caricature cor\u00ad\nresponds to an exaggeration of the norm-idea, an extreme within \nthe type, the genius, marks, for his part, in the face itself and in \nits expression, a divergence which deports the type. \nThe ideal of beauty-this is the other piece-is distinguished \nfrom this norm-idea. It can be encountered only in the human \nform. Man is never beautiful with a pure beauty but ideal beauty \nis reserved for him. Here for the first time absolute interiority \nand absolute morality intervene as conditions of the ideal of beauty: \nthat which absorbs or resorbs the sans of the pure cut. If the \nhuman form and it alone has the right to ideal beauty, it is because \nit expresses the inside and this inside is a relation of reason to a \npure moral end.

The other significant indecision as to the principle concerns \nthe division of the fine arts. This division comprises, as always, \na hierarchy, going far into detail and also resting on an analogy: \nbetween art and human language.

This \ncorrespondence is analogical.

The trait of this double attraction \nis all the more interesting because it has to do with, precisely, \nthe double, and the one, the colossus, as double. \nSpeaking only of the kolossos, Vemant declares: \"Originally, \nthe word has no implication of size [taille].\"31 \"Has no implication \nof size\": this apparently, visibly, means that a kolossos is not \nnecessarily big, gigantic, out of proportion. Although the context, \nand consequently Vernant's manifest intention, does not invite \nthis in the least, the \"implication of size\" carries us somewhere \nelse. Before referring to size, and above all that of the human body, \nfor example foot size, which is also called pointure in French, \ntaille marked the line of a cut, the cutting edge of a sword, all \nthe incisions which come to broach a surface or a thickness and \nopen up a track, delimit a contour, a form or a quantity /a cut/ting) \nof wood or cloth).32 \nIf, \"originally, the word [kolossos] has no implication of size,\" \nit will come to have this implication later, adds Vemant, only by \naccident.

This accident is not, apparently, part \nof the program of Vemant's rich study; he is content to brush the \nquestion aside in his first few lines: \"Originally the word has no \nimplication of size. It does not designate, as it will later for ac\u00ad\ncidental reasons, effigies of gigantic, 'colossal' dimensions. In Greek \nstatue-vocabulary, which as Monsieur E.

To render this second sense of the French taille, and to preserve \nthe uncertainty between the two senses which is vital in some of what \nfollows, we shall use the word \"eise,\" an obsolete spelling of \"size\" (see \nOED) and suggestive of cutting (d. incision). \n"

First of all because it is \nnot a work, an ergon, and then because the infinite is presented \nin it and the infinite cannot be bordered. The beautiful, on the \ncontrary, in the finitude of its formal contours, requires the par\u00ad\nergonal edging all the more because its limitation is not only \nexternal: the parergon, you will remember, is called in by the \nhollowing of a certain lacunary quality within the work. \nIn presenting an indeterminate concept, in one case of the \nunderstanding, in the other of reason, the beautiful and the sub\u00ad\nlime produce a \"Wohlgefallen\" which is often translated by \"sat\u00ad\nisfaction,\" and which I have suggested transposing into \"pleasing\u00ad\noneself-in\" for reasons already given and also to avoid the saturation \nof the \"enough\" which does not fit. In the case of the beautiful, \nthe \"pleasing-ones elf-in\" is \"linked\" to quality, in the case of the \nsublime, to quantity. Wherein one can already anticipate the ques\u00ad\ntion of the cise and the difference between the colossus and the \ncolumn. \nWe had already recognized the other difference in another \ncontext: the pleasure (Lust) provoked by the sublime is negative. \nIf we reread this sequence with a view to the kolossos, the logic \nof the cise, of the pure cut, of the without-cise, of the excess or \nof the almost-too-much-cise, imposes once more its necessity. In \nthe experience of the beautiful, there is intensification and ac\u00ad\nceleration of life, feeling is easily united to the ludic force of the \nimagination and to its attractions (Reizen). In the feeling of the \nsublime, pleasure only \"gushes indirectly.\" It comes after inhi\u00ad\nbition, arrest, suspension (Hemmung) which keep back the vital \nforces. This retention is followed by a brusque outpouring, an \neffusion (Ergiessung) that is all the more potent. The schema here \nis that of a dam. The sluice gate or floodgate interrupts a flow, \nthe inhibition makes the waters swell, the accumulation presses \non the limit. The maximum pressure lasts only an instant (au\u00ad\ngenblicklich), the time it takes to blink an eye, during which the \npassage is strictly closed and the stricture absolute. Then the dam \nbursts and there's a flood. A violent experience in which it is no \nlonger a question of joking, of playing, of taking (positive) plea\u00ad\nsure, nor of stopping at the \"attractions\" of seduction. No more \nplay (Spiel) but seriousness (Ernst) in the occupation of the imag\u00ad\nination. Pleasure is joined with attraction (Reiz), because the mind \nis not merely attracted (angezogen) but, conversely, always also \nrepulsed (abgestossen).

This name translates \nthe absolutely large, not absolute largeness (since this \"large\" is \nalien to and incommensurable with dimension), nor the large \nabsolute (since one might be tempted to invert or permutate the \ntwo attributes and transform one or other into a substantive), but \nthe absolutely large, an incorrect syntax to designate a value which \nis neither absolutely nominalizable (the largeness of the large) nor \na mere modification of the noun (the large as largeness). It is \nbecause it is absolutely large that this large is no longer of the \norder or at the orders of largeness as dimension. It is larger than \n34. \"L'absolument grand n'est pas une grandeur\"; in the exposition \nthat follows, we have translated \"grandeur\" as \"dimension\" or \"large\u00ad\nness\" depending on context. \n"

Here it is. \nWhy can magnitude, which is not a quantity, and not a com\u00ad\nparable quantity in the order of phenomena, let itself be repre\u00ad\nsented under the category of quantity rather than some other \ncategory? What does it have in common or analogous with that \ncategory even when it is incomparable with it? In other words, \nwhy call magnitude or \"absolutely large\" that which is no longer \na quantity? Why this reference, still, to a cise in space? Then, \nanother question, still the same, if phenomenalization is to be \nadmitted, why would the sublime be the absolutely large and not \nthe absolutely small? Why would the absolute excess of dimen\u00ad\nsion, or rather of quantity, be schematized on the side of largeness \nand not of smallness? Why this valorization of the large which \nthus still intervenes in a comparison between incomparables? To \nbe sure, the absolutely large is not compared with anything, not \nwith any phenomenal dimension in any case, but it is preferred \nto the absolutely small. In short, why is the sublime large and \nnot small? Why is the large (absolutely) sublime and not the small \n(absolutely)? Kant posits the fact of this preference, of this plea\u00ad\nsure taken in the larger or of the greater pleasure taken in the \nlarge, of this economy which quasi-tautologically makes the more \nworth more than the less and the absolutely large more than the \nabsolutely small, since the schema of preference (the more) leads \ninto it as an analytical consequence. If indeed one asks oneself, \nas I have just done, why preference should go to the largest, one \nforgets naively that the more and hence largeness are inscribed \nin the movement and in the very concept of preference. So we \nhave to displace the question: Why should there be a preference? \nAnd more strictly, why, if in phenomenality the excess of quantity \nis to announce itself, and likewise the movement beyond com\u00ad\nparison, why should it do so on the side of the large and not the \nsmall, the largest and not the smallest, the less large or the ab\u00ad\nsolutely small? \nKant posits that the preference can only be subjective but the \nvery tautology of the proposition dispenses him from questioning \nit. If no mathematics can as such justify a preference, an advan\u00ad\ntage, a superiority, a privilege ( Vorzug), it must be that an aesthetic \njudgment is implied in it, and a subjective measure coming to \nfound reflective judgments. An object, even if it were to be in\u00ad\ndifferent to us in its existence, still pleases us by its mere large\u00ad\nness, even if one considers it as without form (formlos), and this \n"

The relation to this large\u00ad\nness is not mathematical, nor is the f{respect\" which it inspires, \nand no more is the f{contempt\" aroused by f{what we call simply \nsmall.\" Kant does not ask himself why this should go without \nsaying, naturally toward the largest and the highest. The question \nis all the more inevitable because the nonphenomenal infinity of \nthe idea must always be presented in intuition. Now everything \nthat is \"presented\" in intuition and therefore f{represented\" aes\u00ad\nthetically, every phenomenon is also a quantum. But what decides \nthat, in this quantum, the more is worth more than the less, and \nthe large more or better than the small? The agency of decision \nor \"preference\" can as such be neither phenomenal nor noumenal, \nneither sensible nor intelligible. \nThe question comes back to the origin of presentation. Why \ndoes the large absolute (the sublime), which is not a quantum \nsince it exceeds all comparison, let itself be presented by a quan\u00ad\ntum which does not manage to present it? And why does this \nessentially inadequate quantum present it all the \"better\" for \nbeing larger? The more or less (large) should no longer have any \nmeaning, any pertinence in the view of the large absolute, of \nmagnitude. But it has a meaning, notes Kant (and he describes \nhere what in fact happens) since positive evaluation moves toward \nthe absolute high or large, and not toward the small or medium. \nKant has introduced comparison where he says it should have \nno place. He introduces it, he lets it introduce itself in an appar\u00ad\nently very subtle manner. Not by re-implying magnitude in the \ncomparable, but by comparing the comparable with the incom\u00ad\nparable. The logic of the argument, it seems to me, and perhaps \nthe thing itself, are not without relation to the proof of the ex\u00ad\nistence of God according to Saint Anselm (aliquid quo nihil ma;us \ncogitari potest) \n"
