It must not be forgotten, not one \nmust be forgotten (not one) [pas un seul] if one wants to see or \ntouch something of this group in which a genealogy or even a \nreproduction is feigned. \nNot forget a single one and let each one remain alone, if at \nleast those not yet reading me want to follow this theory of coffins, \nthe obsequence of this cortege in singular lineage, the series with\u00ad\nout model whose procession in a double band, on this wall, still \nfascinates them too much for them to listen to me saying IT WILL \nHAVE REMAINED WITHOUT EXAMPLE. \n3 December 1 9 7 7  \nNot one. \nWhy did the metaphor of family or genealogy force itself upon \nme yesterday? For I know that it lacks pertinence, and the word \nreproduction too. But I am also sure that the limit of this perti\u00ad\nnence-the place where it no longer touches-is indeed also what \nis taking place here, what is happening, what he has set in place. \nI reread. The word \"altuglass\" which he used himself. In de\u00ad\ncomposition: transparent mirror [glace], the cold of death, the \npassing bell [le glas], the ancestor in his foreign language, murder, \nthe artificial or the synthetic (neither nature nor life, burial), all \n"

And yet fallen, destitute, neglected debris, ban\u00ad\nished, excluded from a family (tribe, people, genos) with which \nhe no longer has any relationship. To tell the truth he will never \nhave had any relationship with it, even though, in secret, in an \nimmemorial time, a past which never was present, he will, pre\u00ad\nsumptively, have engendered that family.

So as not to say \nfather, king, or emperor. In this prince, I foresee already something \n'of the heir, the offspring or the child, and perhaps of the stillborn \nchild. I shall no doubt have to come back to this. \nIt's quite certain that I would not have agreed to produce a \ndiscourse above, to one side of or below these coffins without \nadmitting my desire to put myself in them [de m 'y mettre] in my \nturn, irrepressibly, compulsively, 127 times at least, to inscribe \nmy name on the cartouche. \nFor the moment I'm interested in the masculine: un cartouche. \nThe cartouche sometimes has the relief of a sculpture, with \nscrolls (there is no cartouche in general without a card and a scroll) \nbearing inscriptions. They are sometimes the lines [traits] of a \ndrawing around an official document (I'm thinking of a death \ncertificate [un acte de deces]). \nLittre suggests that cartouche is also the name of a sort of \nelliptical ring which, in hieroglyphic inscriptions, surrounds the \nproper names of gods and kings. The ellipsis of a ring would in \nthat case name the alliance committing a genealogy in a proper \nname: something like a letter patent of nobility, a secret seal, a \nplace of exile on the map [carte] (cartuccio), on a card [carte] \nplayed, given out to chance or to necessity, the encrypted geog\u00ad\nraphy of an imperium, another family, another tribe, very familiar \nand very foreign. \nAnd yet I must not attempt to appropriate this series of \ncenotaphs. \nThe word would seem necessary if these funerary caskets \nwere absolutely empty. A cenotaph is an empty tomb (keno\u00ad\nstaphos, kenotaphion) for the departed body of one departed \n[le corps disparu d'un disparu], departed or stolen, pocketed \nby some experienced pickpocket picking his moment [empoche \na l'occasion-et a la tire-par quelque pickpocket exerce]. \nDeparted is the subject. \nBut the caskets are only empty-even after exhaustion-of \nthe body proper [le corps propre]. Other reliefs, relics, leftovers \nremain in them: for example a ring I shall say some more about, \nsome threads [fils] gathered around an empty place (a \"focus\" \n[foyer], he calls it) and above all this mirror right at the bottom. \nIt is there for all speculations, all representations: the scene will \nbegin by repeating itself [se repeter; also \"to rehearse itself\"].
