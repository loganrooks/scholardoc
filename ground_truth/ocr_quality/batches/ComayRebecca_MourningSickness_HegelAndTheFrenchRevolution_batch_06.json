Allen Speight proposes the Romantic \npolylogue as both the model and the object of Hegel\u2019s critique; see id., Hegel, \nLiterature, and the Problem of Agency (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, \n2001), pp. 94\u2013121. For an informative history of the concept of the beautiful soul \nfrom Shaftesbury on, see Robert E. Norton, The Beautiful Soul: Aesthetic Morality \nin the Eighteenth Century (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1995).\n53.\u2002 See Hegel\u2019s analysis of Protestant iconophobia in Faith and Knowledge. For \nSchleiermacher\u2019s aesthetic depiction of religion, see id., On Religion: Speeches to Its \nCultured Despisers (New York: Ungar, 1955), pp. 119\u201345.\n54.\u2002 Hegel does not explicitly make this claim about Romantic libertinism, but \nit is implicit in his emphasis on the beautiful soul\u2019s timidity. Schlegel deconstructs \nGoethe\u2019s version of the beautiful soul in his novel Lucinde, but Hegel\u2019s analysis \ninvites us to see how Julius and Lucinde reproduce her behavior. For Nietzsche\u2019s \ndescription of the phobic stance of \u201cimmaculate perception\u201d and the fear of cre-\nativity that also drives creativity, see Zarathustra, \u201cOn Immaculate Perception\u201d: \n\u201cBut now your emasculated leering wants to be called \u2018contemplation!\u2019 And what-\never allows itself to be touched by cowardly eyes is to be christened \u2018beautiful\u2019! \nOh you besmirchers of noble names\u201d (Thus Spoke Zarathustra, trans. Adrian Del \nCaro [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006], p. 96). In the Antichrist, \nNietzsche comes close to naming the beautiful soul\u2014a \u201cpale, sickly, idiotic-\u00adfanatic\u201d \nhuddling inside a cadaverous body; id., Twilight of the Idols and the Anti-Christ, \ntrans. R. J. Hollingdale (Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin Books, 1962), p. 168.\n55.\u2002 For a discussion of the pietistic background of the idea of the beautiful \nsoul, see Norton, Beautiful Soul, chap. 2. For Hegel\u2019s own relationship to pietism, \nsee Laurence Dickey, Hegel: Religion, Economics, and the Politics of Spirit, 1770\u20131807 \n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), and for illuminating discussion of \nthe political tendencies of German pietism in Hegel\u2019s time, see Warren Breckman, \nMarx, the Young Hegelians, and the Origins of Radical Social Theory: Dethroning the \nSelf (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999); John E. Toews, Hegelian-\nism: The Path Toward Dialectical Humanism, 1805\u20131841 (Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniversity Press, 1985), pp. 243ff.; F.

His description of the fetishized interiority of Roman-\ntic Sehnsucht chimes with his description of the unhappy consciousness in the \nPhenomenology. The Catholic obsession with the \u201cthings\u201d of devotional practice \n(with its historical roots in the Crusades) and the Protestant inflation of the spiri-\n"

Peter Uwe Hohendahl (Lincoln: University \nof Nebraska Press, 1988), argues that such a regression to myth is implicit in the \nJena period. Novalis had written his monarchist fantasy Faith and Love by 1798 \nand Christianity and Europe by 1799; Wilhelm Wackenroder\u2019s Herzensergiessungen \neines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders was published in 1797. Frederick Beiser careful-\nly dismantles the opposition between manifest Catholicism and latent Lutheran-\nism in German Romantic culture (and points to the resolution of this antithesis in \nsome kind of ecumenical Spinozism) in his excellent introduction to Early Politi-\ncal Writings of the German Romantics, pp. xxi\u2013xxii. For an attempt to salvage the \npolitical explosiveness of Novalis from the politics of \u201clate\u201d Romanticism (and \nfrom the alleged editorial manipulation and mythography of Ludwig Tieck and \nFriedrich Schlegel), see William Arctander O\u2019Brien, Novalis: Signs of Revolution \n(Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1995).\n60.\u2002 E.g., experimental literary or erotic m\u00e9nages such as those occasional-\nly found in Jena and fictionalized by Schlegel in Lucinde. \u201cThat I am one with \nmyself, that I am what I had the native endowment to become, that I see truth, \nthat I feel harmonious beauty, that is your work, yours alone; and it is my work, \nmine alone, that you too are what you were meant to be, that you too see truth, \nand experience beauty and harmony,\u201d Wilhelm von Humboldt wrote to his wife \n(quoted by W. H. Bruford, The German Tradition of Self-Cultivation: Bildung from \nHumboldt to Thomas Mann [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1975], p. 10). \nHegel mocks the elitism of the pietist conventicles\u2014\u201clittle congregations\u201d that \n\u201cfloat apart and gather together by chance . . . like the patterns in a sea of sand \ngiven over to the play of the winds\u201d (Faith and Knowledge, p. 151).\n61.\u2002 In the Religion, Kant warns against the ever-present risks of misanthropy \nlurking in his own moral rigorism (Ak 6: 34; RR 81); and cf. his remarks in Meta-\nphysics of Morals (Ak 6: 466; MM 582) on allotrio-episcopia (\u201ca mania for spying on \nthe morals of others\u201d) and on moral arrogance [Hochmut] as the flip side of a syco-\nphancy that \u201cwaives any claim to respect from others\u201d (6: 466; MM 582).\n62.\u2002 \u201cNo man is a hero to his valet; not, however, because the man is not a \nhero, but because the valet\u2014is a valet, whose dealings are with the man, not as \na hero, but as one who eats, drinks, and wears clothes\u201d (PhG \u00a7665). The moral \nvalet is an abrasive variant of the \u201ceverlasting irony of the community\u201d that had \nexpressed the crisis of political authority and the collapse of ethical certainty at \nthe end of Sittlichkeit: irony \u201cchanges the universal end of the government into \n"

(The gendering of irony, in this earlier passage, \nas well as everything concealed in this, cannot be pursued here.) The function of \nirony, at this earlier stage, had been to deflate the heroism of every universal claim, \nand to expose the vanity of politics, which it reduced to a vestigial \u201cornament.\u201d \nRomantic irony works similarly, in that it expresses the collapse of moral certain-\nty: it deflates every universal claim by exposing the surd of amour de soi\u2014vanity, \nambition, lust for power\u2014in every moral act. Irony is thus the residue of a failed \nmourning. The corpse takes its revenge on Creon (faith on insight) by turning \ndisenchantment against itself: irony demystifies secular heroism by recalling the \nstench of the particular in every moral act. The valet knows\u2014he has to pick up \nthe laundry.\nHegel\u2019s formulation here, as often, reads like an adage and was destined to \nbecome a quotation. Hegel\u2019s dictum is in fact adapted from Rousseau, who had \nhimself adapted it from Montaigne and others (see Allen Wood\u2019s notes to PhR \n\u00a7124 for a detailed textual history). Goethe adapts the passage in Elective Affinities \n(in Ottilie\u2019s diary). Hegel quotes himself in the Philosophy of Right (PhR \u00a7124), and \nin the Philosophy of History he draws attention to Goethe\u2019s citation of him. \u201c\u2018No \nman is a hero to his valet-de-chambre,\u2019 is a well-known proverb; I have \u00adadded\u2014\nand Goethe repeated it ten years later\u2014\u2018but not because the former is no hero, \netc.\u2019\u201d (VPG 49; PhH 32). At the point of confronting the Romantic fetish of cre-\nativity, Hegel simultaneously underlines and effaces the authorship of his own \ntext; or rather, he emphasizes his own originality vis-\u00e0-vis Goethe, while relegating \nthe aper\u00e7u to proverbial wisdom.\n63.\u2002 Nietzsche, Preface to Twilight of the Idols. Hegel frequently uses the image \nof the hollow vessel in his discussions of Romanticism; see, e.g., Faith and Knowl-\nedge, p. 61: \u201chubbub of vanity without a firm core.\u201d\n64.\u2002 Hegel distinguishes in the Encyclopedia between the abstract or destruc-\ntive negativity of pure sound (a sheer vanishing in time without retention) and the \nconcrete or determinate negativity of the verbal sign, in which meaning is retained \nwithin the inwardness of thought (Enz 3: 116; PhM \u00a7401 Z, p. 87).\n65.\u2002 Nietzsche, \u201cOn the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life,\u201d \u00a75, in \nUntimely Meditations, ed.

Theodor Adorno on Rausch, in \u201cIn Memory of Eichendorff,\u201d in id., \nNotes to Literature (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991).\n67.\u2002 On the resurgence of Catholic devotional tropes within Hegel\u2019s thorough\u00ad\ngoing analysis of contemporary Protestant subjectivity, see n. 56 above. The chapter \non the unhappy consciousness had traced a reverse trajectory; we can observe surpris-\ning eruptions of \u201cProtestant\u201d tropes\u2014Luther\u2019s constipation, pietistic S\u00adehnsucht\u2014\nin Hegel\u2019s account of Catholic subjectivity in the \u201cunhappy consciousness\u201d section. \n"

There are, of course, many ways \nto analyze this depoliticization, among which see Virginia Swain, Grotesque Fig-\nures: Baudelaire, Rousseau, and the Aesthetics of Modernity (Baltimore: Johns Hop-\nkins University Press, 2004).\n71.\u2002 H\u00f6lderlin, Hyperion, or The Hermit in Greece (1797/1799), trans.

Harris, Hegel\u2019s Ladder, 2: 494\u2013501, argues for the connection, \neven though Hyperion\u2019s \u201chard-heartedness\u201d does not perfectly exemplify that of \nthe beautiful soul: Hyperion does not retreat from the political arena, even if he \nends up disillusioned. Nor can H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s own madness (whatever its relevance) \nbe read as the fate of the isolated aesthete, or without reference to the contem-\nporary political situation (including the strain of the pending treason charge in \n1805, which was eventually dropped on account of his mental condition). See \nPierre Bertaux, H\u00f6lderlin und die franz\u00f6sische Revolution (Frankfurt am Main: \nSuhrkamp, 1969). But here too the accuracy of Hegel\u2019s allusion is less important \nthan its heuristic function. As has been often noted, Hegel maintained to the \nend a deafening silence on the subject of his once close friend. See Dieter Hen-\nrich, \u201cHegel und H\u00f6lderlin,\u201d in Hegel im Kontext (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, \n1971), and Daniel Berthold-Bond, Hegel\u2019s Theory of Madness (Albany: State Uni-\nversity of New York Press, 1995).\n72.\u2002 See J.

See also Chlo\u00eb Taylor, The Cul-\nture of Confession from Augustine to Foucault: A Genealogy of the \u201cconfessing animal\u201d \n(New York: Routledge, 2009).\n19.\u2002 Derrida, \u201cTo Forgive,\u201d p. 44, invokes a distinctly Kantian framework when \nhe underscores the difference between the \u201cquasi-secret solitude of forgiveness\u201d \nand the ritual theatricality of amnesty.\n20.\u2002 I am reconstructing the first part of this argument. Hegel supplies the sec-\nond part. This is why the thirteenth article of the 1791 French penal code abolished \nthe sovereign\u2019s right to pardon in jury trials as a remnant of absolutism. Kant puts \nhis finger on the theological-political kernel: \u201c[T]he right to grant clemency [ius \naggratiandi] is the slipperiest one for [the monarch] to exercise, for it must be exer-\ncised in such a way as to show the splendor of his majesty, although he is thereby \ndoing injustice in the highest degree\u201d (Ak 6: 336; MM 477). Hegel touches on the \ndilemma in the Philosophy of Right in his discussion of the constitutional monarch \nwhose logical necessity is deduced but precisely for his vacuity\u2014a mere \u201cdot on \nan\u00a0i.\u201d Hegel assigns the monarch a purely ceremonial function, later much derided \nby Marx: he signs forms. The function of the king\u2019s signature is to make symboli-\ncally manifest the presence of individual subjectivity latent in the political order. \nThe monarch also, however, has the sovereign privilege of clemency: \u201conly the sov-\nereign is entitled to actualize the power of the spirit to undo what has been done \nand to nullify crime by forgiving and forgetting [im Vergeben und Vergessen das \n\u00adVerbrechen zu vernichten]\u201d (PhR \u00a7282). In the following remarks, Hegel emphasizes \nthe difference between pardon and forgiveness, which relates to the gap between \nobjective and absolute spirit, already established in \u00a7270 Z. \u201cPardon is the remis-\nsion of punishment, but it is not a cancellation of right. . . .  This cancellation . . . \nmay be effected by religion, for what has been done can be undone in spirit by spirit \n"
