      "full_text": "Point de philosophie\n\"truth\" and \"reality\" are once again in quotation marks, advanced as effects of\nlanguage and as simple citations. But if the \"1 think therefore I am\" \"has no\nmeaning\na fortiori no truth, it has \"a very great value,\" and\nlike the style is \"entirely characteristic of the man himself.\" This value is that\nof a shattering blow, a quasi-arbitrary affirmation of mastery by means of the\nexercise of a style, the egotistic impression of a form, the stratagem of a mise\nen scene powerful enough to do without truth, a mise en scene keeping that\nmuch less to truth in its laying of truth as a trap, a trap into which generations\nof servile fetishists will come to be caught, thereby acknowledging the law of\nthe master, of I, Ren\u00e9 Descartes.\nValery insists upon the style: \"It is predsely this that I think I see in the Cogito.\nNeither a syllogism nor even meaning in the literal sense; but a reflex action of\nthe man, or more accurately, the explosion of an act, a shattering blow. There\nis, in any thinker of such intellectual power, what might be described as a home\npolicy and a foreign policy of thought; he sets up certain 'reasons of state' against\nwhich nothing can prevail ... Never, until he came, had a philosopher so\ndeliberately exhibited himself on the stage of his own thought, risking his own\nneck, daring to write 'I' for whole pages on end; he does it above all, and in an\nadmirable style, when writing the Meditations .\n.\n. I have called his style admi-\nrable\" (9, 55\u201456).\nFurther on, and elsewhere, Valery associates style with the \"timbre\" of the\nvoice. Descartes could assert himself, posit his mastery, only by \"paying with\nhis person,\" exposing himself in a theater, putting himself on stage and into\nplay \"by risking the I.\" And henceforth at issue are the style of his writing and\nthe timbre of his voice.\nHow are we to reassemble these propositions? Will it be said that Descartes,\nby means of what is inimitable in his text (timbre and style), has succeeded in\nimposing the source, in restoring the presence of the origin that is so implacably\nset aside by the play of signification?\n23. \"At this point I am going to take a considerable risk. I say that we can consider it\nfrom a very different point of view\u2014we can assert that this brief and pregnant expression\nof its author's personality has no meaning whatever. But I must add that it has a very great\nvalue, entirely characteristic of the man himself.\n\"I maintain that\nergo sum has no meaning because that little word sum has no\nmeaning. No one dreams of saying or needs to say 'I am' unless he is taken for dead and\nwants to protest that he is not. In any case he would say 'I'm alive.' But a cry or the\nslightest movement would be quite sufficient. No, 'I am' cannot tell anyone anything and\nis no answer to any intelligible question. But the remark does correspond here to something\nelse, which I shall explain presently. Furthermore, what meaning can be attributed to a\nproposition whose negative form would express its content just as well as the positive?\nIf '1 am' means anything, 'I am not' tells us neither more nor less\" (9, 54). In the Address\nto the Congress of Surgeons, Valery scans the formula: \"At one moment I think; at another\nI am\" (11, 139).\nI have proposed elsewhere an interpretation of the equivalence, \"I am\": \"I am living\":\n\"I am dead.\" Although made from a very different point of view, this interpretation\nnevertheless seems to me to intersect with Valery's.

      "full_text": "Qual Queue\nHere the question of psychoanalysis imposes itself. All the motifs I have\nemphasized, and still others, to a certain point are in agreement, in any event\nin their principles, with Freud's motifs: redefinition of the I (the ego) and con-\nsciousness as effects in a system, development of the logic of a primary narcis-\nsism in relation to a death drive, systematic interest in everything that escapes\nthe control of waking consciousness (Valery's meditation on dreams was un-\nceasing), etc. One could pursue the correspondence of the two texts a long way.\nI do not know whether Freud read Valery, and since it is not his birthday, I leave\nsuspended the question of knowing why, and above all if he can be excused for\nthis. But why did Valery so nervously reject psychoanalysis? Why did he seize\nupon the argument of the unnamable that he just as summarily could have used\nagainst all science? The connotation of nervousness, of precipitation, and of\nspasm are not insignificant. Valery could have offered arguments, showed his\ndisagreement, asked epistemological questions, differentiated his criticisms, vig-\nilantly examined what then could be seen of psychoanalysis: but he did so only\nby opposing his formalist point of view\u2014which therefore produces an effect of\nobscurantism here\u2014to what he considered to be Freud's semantic, \"significa-\ntive\" point of view about\nBut why talk about Freud's \"stupidity\"?\nWhy multiply sarcastic remarks against those whom he names \"Freud and Co.\"?\nMost often it is the insistence on sexuality that infuriates him, and without\nrecognizing, wanting or being able to recognize, that Freud's \"sexualism\" is\n28. For example: \"1 have been concerned with dreams for centuries. Since then have\ncome the theses of Freud and Co., which are completely different\u2014because it is the\npossibility and intrinsic characteristics of the phen. which interest me; while for them, it\nis its meaning, its relation to the subject's history\u2014which I am not worried about.\" Valery\nhad just written: \"The small child of two years is transparent. Its impressions, its psyche,\nand its acts have very few waystations\" (C. 19, p. 456, 1936).\n\"My theories of the dream are completely opposed to those of the day. They are'com-\npletely 'formal,' while the latter are completely 'significative' \"(C. 17, p. 766, 1935). \"Now,\nI am inclined to think that these words have no meaning, that it is useless to look for\nmeaning in them, vain to give them meaning. And the reflex acts of the sleeper are only\nlinear responses. The sleeper discharges himself through the brain as through the limbs\u2014\nwithout past or future\u2014without additivity. For my way of thinking, it is a mistake to\napproach dreams by way of the significative\" (ibid., p. 771). See also p. 770, and the entire\nchapter \"Le r\u00e9ve et l'analyse de Ia conscience,\" in Judith Robinson, L'analyse de l'esprit dans\nles Cahiers de Valery (Paris: Corti, 1963). This semanticist error, if we may put it thus, is\nwhat from Valery's point of view deprives psychoanalysis of all scientificity, if not all\nefficacity. \"If Freud's theories have therapeutic value, it is highly probable that they have\nno scientific value\" (C. 11, p. 476, 1926). \"There are authors (and therefore theories at their\nservice) whose works, consciously founded on the unconscious, are comparable finally\nto the Flea Market\" (C. 17, p. 515, 1934).\nAs is inevitable in this situation of misconstruing, Valery, who calls himself \"the least\nFreudian of men\" (cited by Robinson, L'analyse, p. 105), occasionally makes statements\nthat Freud would not simply have rejected, at the very moment when it is believed that\nthese statements are in opposition to him. Thus: \"Freud's theories are repulsive to my\nway of thinking, which would have it that in dreams the ideas of the most insignificant\nthings from waking life play a role equal to that played by things which are moving, or\nwould be the most moving\" (C. 11, p. 621, 1925\u201426).\n300\n"

When the interlocutor, imprudent\nsoul, proposes to \"open up the Implex,\" even risking a rapprochement between\nthe implex and the unconscious, he is simply threatened with being thrown into\nthe sea. All the criticisms that have been addressed to psychoanalysis in France\nfor fifty years, find their resources here: \"We'll have to open up thelmplex. But\nwait a moment. Does this Implex of yours amount to any more than what vulgar,\ncommon mortals, the masses, philosophers, psychologists, psychopaths, the\nnon-Crusoes\u2014the herd, in fact\u2014call quite simply and crudely the 'unconscious'\nor the 'subconscious.'?\n\"\u2014Do you want me to pitch you into the sea?.\n. .

What he reproaches\nanalysis for is not that it interprets in such or such a fashion, but quite simply\nthat it interprets at all, that it is an interpretation, that it is interested above all\nin signification, in meaning, and in some principial unity\u2014here, a sexual unity\u2014\nof meaning.

Something within it remains necessary and must be maintained, it\nseems to me, in opposition to all precritical semanticisms. The psychoanalytic\ndiscourses known to us are far from being exempt from this semanticism. Per-\nhaps we here are touching upon a limit at which the opposition of form and\n304\n"

Following a strange figure of discourse, one first must ask\nwhether the word or signifier \"communication\" communicates a determined\ncontent, an identifiable meaning, a describable value.ItBut in order to articulate\nand to propose this question, I already had to anticipate the meaning of the\nword communication: I have had to predetermine communication as the vehicle,\ntransport, or site of passage of a meaning, and of a meaning that is one. If\ncommunication had several meanings, and if this plurality could not be reduced,\nthen from the outset it would not be justified to define communication itself as\nthe transmission of a meaning, assuming that we are capable of understanding\none another as concerns each of these words (transmission, meaning, etc.).\nNow, the word communication, which nothing initially authorizes us to overlook\nas a word, and to impoverish as a polysemic word, opens a semantic field which\nprecisely is not limited to semantics, semiotics, and even less to linguistics. To\nthe semantic field of the word communication belongs the fact that it also des-\nignates nonsemantic movements. Here at least provisional recourse to ordinary\nlanguage and to the equivocalities of natural language teaches us that one may,\nfor example, communicate a movement, or that a tremor, a shock, a displacement\nof force can be communicated\u2014that is, propagated, transmitted. It is also said\n/ that different or distant places can communicate between each other by means\nof a given passageway or opening.(What happens in this case, what is trans-\nmitted or communicated, are not phenomena of meaning or signification.\nthese cases we are dealing neither with a semantic or conceptual content, nor\nwith a semiotic operation, and even less with a linguistic exchange.\nNevertheless, we will not say that this nonsemiotic sense of the word com-\nmunication, such as it is at work in ordinary language, in one or several of the\nso-called natural languages, constitutes the proper or primitive meaning, and that\nconsequently the semantic, semiotic, or linguistic meaning corresponds to a\nderivation, an extension or a reduction, a metaphoric displacement. We will not\nsay, as one might be tempted to do, that semiolinguistic communication is more\nmetaphorico entitled \"communication,\" because\n\"real\" communication it gives passage, transports, raflsrn\nsQmething, gives\naccess to something We will not say so\n1. because the value of literal, proper meaning appears more problematical than\never,\n309\n"

I am asking the question in this form in order to forestall an objection.\nIn effect, it might be said to me: you cannot allege that you account for the so-\ncalled graphematic structure of locution solely on the basis of the occurrence of\nfailures of the performative, however real these failures might be, and however\neffective or general their possibility. You cannot deny that there are also per-\nformatives that succeed, and they must be accounted for: sessions are opened,\nas Paul Ricoeur did yesterday, one says \"I ask a question,\" one bets, one chal-\nlenges, boats are launched, and one even marries occasionally. Such events, it\nappears, have occurred. And were a single one of them to have taken place a\nsingle time, it would still have to be accounted for.\nI will say \"perhaps.\" Here, we must first agree upon what the \"occurring\"\nor the eventhood of an event consists in, when the event supposes in its allegedly\npresent and singular intervention a statement which in itself can be only of a\nrepetitive or citational structure, or rather, since these last words lead to con-\nfusion, of an iterable structure. Therefore, I come back to the point which seems\nfundamental to me, and which now concerns the status of the event in general,\nof the event of speech or by speech, of the strange logic it supposes, and which\noften remains unperceived.\nCould a performative statement succeed if its formulation did not repeat a\n\"coded\" or iterable statement, in other words if the expressions I use to open\na meeting, launch a ship or a marriage were not identifiable as conforming to an\niterable model, and therefore if they were not identifiable in a way as \"citation\"?\nNot that citationality here is of the same type as in a play, a philosophical\nreference, or the recitation of a poem. This is why there is a relative specificity,\nas Austin says, a \"relative purity\" of performatives. But this relative purity is\nnot constructed against citationality or iterability, but against other kinds of it-\neration within a general iterabiity which is the effraction into the allegedly\nrigorous purity of every event of discourse or every speech act. Thus, one must\nless oppose citation or iteration to the noniteration of an event, than construct\na differential typology of forms of iteration, supposing that this is a tenable\nproject that can give rise to an exhaustive program, a question I am holding off\non here. In this typology, the category of intention wifi not disappear; it will\nhave its place, but from this place it will no longer be able to govern the entire\nscene and the entire system of utterances. Above all, one then would be con-\ncerned with different types of marks or chains of iterable marks, and not with\nan opposition between citational statements on the one hand, and singular and\noriginal statement-events on the other. The first consequence of this would be\nthe following: given this structure of iteration, the intention which animates\nutterance will never be completely present in itself and its content. The iteration\nwhich structures it apriori intr ducesan essential ciehiscence\n326\n"

It is this questioned effect that I have elsewhere called\nlogocentrism.\n2. The semantic horizon which habitually governs the notion of communi-\ncation is exceeded or punctured by the intervention of writing, that is of a\ndissemination which cannot be reduced to a polysemia. jWriting is read, and \"in\nthe last analysis\" does not give rise to a hermeneutic deciphering, to the decoding\nof a meaning or truth.\n3. Despite the general displacement of the classical, \"philosophical,\" Western,\netc., concept of writing, it appears necessary, provisionally and strategically, to\nconserve the old name. This implies an entire logic of paleonymy which I do not\nwish to elaborate here.'6 Very schematically: an opposition of metaphysical con-\ncepts (for example, speech/writing, presence/absence, etc.) is n\u00e7ver the face-to-\nface of two terms, but a hierarchy and an order of subordination.LDeconstruction\ncannot limit itself or proceed immediately to a neutralization: it must, by means\nof a double gesture, a double science, a double writing, p'ractice\noverturning\nof the classical opposition and a general displacement of the\nIt is only on\nthis condition that deconstruction will provide itself the means with which to\nintervene in the field of oppositions that it criticizes, which is also a field of\nnondiscursive forces.

There is a work\u2014metaphysical or not\u2014on conceptual systems.\nDeconstruction does not consist in passing from one concept to another, but in\noverturning and displacing a conceptual order, as well as the nonconceptual\norder with which the conceptual order is articulated. For example, writing, as\na classical concept, carries with it predicates which have been subordinated,\nexcluded, or held in reserve by forces and according to necessities to be analyzed.\nIt is these predicates (1 have mentioned some) whose force of generality, gen-\neralization, and generativity find themselves liberated, grafted onto a \"new\"\nconcept of writing which also corresponds to whatever always has resisted the\nformer organization of forces, whith always has constituted the remainder irre-\n15.
