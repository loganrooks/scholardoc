An upping that attempts to change the meaning of majesty \nor sovereignty, to make its meaning mutate, while keeping the old word \nor while claiming to give it back its most digni\ufb01 ed meaning. There is the \nsovereign majesty of the sovereign, the King, and there is, more majestic or \ndifferently majestic, more sovereign or differently sovereign, the majesty \nof poetry, or the majesty of the absurd insofar as it bears witness to the \npresence of the human. This hyperbolic upping of the ante is inscribed in \nwhat I shall call the dynamics of majesty or of sovereignty, in its dynamics \nbecause we\u2019re dealing with a movement where precipitation is ineluctable, \nand a dynamics (I choose this word deliberately) because we are dealing with \nthe sovereign, speci\ufb01 cally with power, with potency (dynamis), with the de-\nployment of the potentiality of the dynast and the dynasty. That is to say, \n\u201cthere is something more majestic\u201d than the majesty of the king, just as \nMonsieur Teste, you remember, was described as superior to the superior \nman, or Nietzsche\u2019s superman as above the superior man.

Insist on this \u201cmore,\u201d and the void.)43\nBut then, why keep the word?\nWhat counts most here, with Celan, is that this hypermajesty of poetry, \nbeyond or outside the majesty of the king, the sovereign, or the monarch, \nthis supreme majesty of the absurd, as majesty of Dichtung, is determined \nby four equally serious values, among which I believe we must still privilege \none, or rather recognize among them the privilege of one only, and it is that \nof the present (Gegenwart). These four serious values or meanings are that \nof testimony, of course; that of majesty insofar as it bears witness (zeugenden \nMajest\u00e4t); that of the human for which it bears witness; but above all, in my \nview, because it is continually con\ufb01 rmed and repeated, that of the present \n(\u201cGehuldigt wird hier der f\u00fcr die Gegenwart des Menschlichen zeugenden Ma-\njest\u00e4t des Absurden\u201d). Majesty is here majestic, and it is poetry, insofar as it \nbears witness to the present, the now, the \u201cpresence,\u201d as Launay translates \nit, of the human. Just as to bear witness is always to perform an act of pres-\nence, through speech addressed to the other, attesting to a presence, so what \ncounts here, and what signs, is a presence attesting to a presence or rather \nto a present, qua human.\nI would not privilege to this extent the present, the presence of this pres-\nent, if, beyond all the reasons you easily imagine, Celan himself did not \nreturn to it with an insistence that is obvious and, I believe, undeniable. I \nshall be briefer, for lack of time today, on the other two promised examples \nor returns.\nSecond return. Around ten pages later, after a trajectory that I cannot \nreconstitute but from which we\u2019ll follow a few essential stages next time, \nCelan says this about what he calls \u201clanguage actualized\u201d (aktualisierte \nSprache), under the sign of a \u201cradical individuation\u201d: he says this, then, add-\ning the present to the now, making Gegenwart more serious with Pr\u00e4senz:\nThen the poem would be \u2014 even more clearly than before \u2014 the language \nof an individual which has taken on form; and, in keeping with its inner-\nmost nature, it would also be the present, the here and now.

On the following page, Celan speci\ufb01 es something essential as \nto, let\u2019s say, the structure of this now- present, and it is from this speci\ufb01 -\ncation, which risks complicating everything, that I shall begin again next \ntime. He speci\ufb01 es that this now- present of the poem, my now- present, the \npunctual now- present of a punctual I, my now- present must allow the now-\n present of the other, the time of the other, to speak. It must leave time, give \ntime to the other.\nTo the other, it must leave or give its time. Its own time.\nTo the other, it must leave or give its time. To the other, it must leave or \ngive its own time. This formulation is not literally Celan\u2019s, but I imprint \non it this ambiguous or even unheimlich grammar, in which we no lon-\nger know to whom the possessive adjective belongs, to self or other (to the \nother, leave or give its time), I give or leave it this grammatical equivocity to \ntranslate what I believe to be the truth of what Celan is saying: to the other, \nleave or give its own time.\nWhich of course introduces into the now- present a divisibility or an al-\nterity that changes everything. It gives over to a total rereading of the pre-\ndominant authority, even of the majesty of the present, that becomes that of \nthe other or that of a dissymmetrical division with the other, turned toward \nthe other or come from the other. I now read the passage in question, liter-\nally, sometimes, when necessary, in both languages.\nThe poem becomes \u2014 and under what conditions! \u2014 a poem of one who \u2014 \nas before \u2014 perceives, is turned to [zugewandt, I emphasize this turn, the \nturn of this \u201cturned\u201d] that which appears [dem Erscheinenden Zugewandten]. \nWho questions this appearing and addresses it [dieses Erscheinende Befragen-\nden und Ansprechenden: this Ansprechen \u2014 the  turning- oneself toward the \nother to speak to him, to address, speak to the other, even to apostrophize \nthe other \u2014 is no doubt the turning and the turn that answers for everything \nin this passage, and even in \u201cThe Meridian\u201d: and I say this \u201cturn\u201d less to \nsuggest a \ufb01 gure, a turn of phrase, or even one of those rhetorical \ufb01 gures \nof which Celan is very wary, than to signal toward Atemwende, the turn or \nturning of breath, which is so often, literally, inspiration itself, the spirit of \n\u201cThe Meridian\u201d].

Do not forget that \ndolphin, delphis in Greek, delphinus in Latin, is \ufb01 rst of all the name given \nby man to that other great [gros et grand] animal, that carnivorous cetacean \nwhose blubber furnishes a precious oil (delphinus delphis) and which passes \nfor being so close to man, so benevolent and friendly a matter toward us \nthat La Fontaine, who dedicated his Fables to \u201cMonseigneur le Dauphin,\u201d \nwrote its eulogy: he praised the animal, did La Fontaine, an animal not so \nb\u00eate, as you\u2019ll see, and an animal friendly to man, in a fable I\u2019m going to \nread to you, after recalling that the French title \u201cDauphin,\u201d used to desig-\nnate the king\u2019s son and thus the heir to the throne, has a very French, purely \nFrench history, as in the calendar of the monarchy and the revolution we \nare interested in at the moment. Dauphin was originally a name borne by \nthe lords of the French province of the Viennois at the time the Dauphin\u00e9 \nwas ceded to the king of France. Now the proper name at the origin of \nthe Dauphin\u00e9 was Delphinus, the name of the \ufb01 sh, quite simply because \nthe lords had chosen three dolphins to \ufb01 gure on their coat of arms. Which \nmeans, if one interprets this heraldic symbolism as a sort of totemic effect, \nthat the title Dauphin for the elder son and royal heir is, at least by a drift \ntoward a royal beach, a totemic title. If now I read in extenso the fable of La \nFontaine entitled The Monkey and the Dolphin, it\u2019s not merely because of \nthe irony whereby the subject citizen La Fontaine dedicates all his fables \nto his virtual sovereign, Monseigneur le Dauphin. It is for many other rea-\nsons: for if all the animals in the fables are anthropomorphic \ufb01 gures, and \nin one way or another human \ufb01 gures, as positive or negative heroes, here \nthe animal is not only human like all the others but embodies, among the \nhuman animals, among animals in human form, among the anthropoids in \nthe broad sense of this word, one of those that are naturally more human \nand above all friendly to man, \u201ca strong friend of our species,\u201d as the fable \nsays. And then there is the monkey, the other hero of the fable. The mon-\nkey is not just any animal, in our problematic and among the animals that \n341 \n342 \n"

What is essential and proper to \nsovereignty is thus not grandeur or height as geometrically measurable, \nsensible, or intelligible, but excess, hyperbole, an excess insatiable for the \npassing of every determinable limit: higher than height, grander than gran-\ndeur, etc. It is the more, the more than that counts, the absolutely more, the \nabsolute supplement that exceeds any comparative toward an absolute su-\nperlative.

In this very \nplace, a few years ago, I emphasized the decisive importance (scarcely no-\nticed, if at all) of the vocabulary of the Unheimliche and of Unheimlichkeit in \nHeidegger (an importance as great as in Freud, though at least apparently \ndifferent).13 Now without wanting nor being able to reopen wide the ques-\ntion of the Unheimliche in Heidegger, from Sein und Zeit up to the end, I \nshall content myself with pointing out \u2014 precisely because it has to do with \nthe human and the inhuman \u2014 a passage from the Introduction to Meta-\nphysics (1935), which resonates strangely (unheimlich) with what Celan says \nabout the Unheimliche as what at home in art seems to exceed the human in \nthe human, seems to step outside the human in human art.\nI reopen the Introduction to Metaphysics rather violently, guided by what \nmatters to us at the moment, at the point where Heidegger relaunches the \nquestion \u201cWhat is man?\u201d14 Let me put down a couple of essential mark-\ners before coming on to what interests us here in this journey, namely the \nUnheimliche.\n1. First marker. Heidegger begins by asserting the secondary character, the \nfundamentally derived, late- on- the- scene, and (from the ontological point \nof view) fundamentally very unsatisfactory character of a de\ufb01 nition of man \nas animal rationale or as zo\u00afon logon ekhon. Incidentally, he interestingly and \nunassailably calls this de\ufb01 nition \u201czoological,\u201d not only but also in the sense \nthat it links the logos to the zo\u00afon and claims to render account and reason \n(lo gon di donai) of the essence of man by saying of him that he is \ufb01 rst of all \na \u201cliving thing,\u201d an \u201canimal\u201d (\u201cDie genannte De\ufb01 nition des Menschen ist im \nGrunde eine zoologische\u201d).

In other words, so long as one has not \nquestioned ontologically the essence of being alive, the essence of life, it \nremains problematic and obscure to de\ufb01 ne man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon. Now \nit is on this unquestioned basis, this problematical basis of an unelucidated \nontological question of life that the whole of the West, says Heidegger, has \nconstructed its psychology, its ethics, its theory of knowledge, and its an-\nthropology. And Heidegger then describes with irony and a superior air \nthe state of the culture in which we live, in which one can receive books \nbearing on their cover the title What Is Humanity? without even a hint of a \nquestion being asked beyond the cover of such a book, which, he notes (in \n1935), the Frankfurter Zeitung praises for being a book that is \u201cunusual and \ncourageous.\u201d15\n2. Second marker. Henceforth the reply to the question \u201cWhat is man?\u201d can-\nnot be a reply but a question, a questioning, an act and experience of Fra-\ngen, for in this question it is man himself who is determining himself by \nquestioning about himself, about his being, discovering himself in this way \nto be of a questioning essence in the Fragen. From which Heidegger draws \ntwo conclusions in one, namely that \u2014 I\u2019m citing the [French] translation \nthat seems to me not very illuminating and that I shall attempt to clarify \nlater: \u201cIt is only insofar as he comes forth in questioning that man comes \nto himself and is a self\u201d (\u201cDer Mensch kommt erst als  fragend- geschichtlicher \nzu ihm selbst und ist ein Selbst\u201d [comment]). And that therefore this Selbst, \nthis self, this ipseity (as Selbst is translated) that is not yet an \u201cI,\u201d nor an \nindividual, nor a \u201cwe,\u201d nor a community, is a \u201cwho\u201d before any \u201cI,\u201d any in-\ndividual, any person, any \u201cwe,\u201d and any community (a fortiori, I would add \nfor what is of interest to us, nor a subject or a political animal, for Heideg-\nger\u2019s suspicion about man as zo\u00afon logon ekhon, animal rationale, would be \nthe same as to man as political animal, an expression of Aristotle\u2019s to which \nwe shall return at length later). So that \u2014 second conclusion wrapped up \nin the \ufb01 rst \u2014 the question of man as to his own being (nach seinem eigenen \nSein) is transformed, is no longer \u201cWhat is man?\u201d What is man? (Was ist der \nMensch?), but \u201cWho is man?\u201d (Wer ist der Mensch?).\nHaving recalled these two markers, you will see, if you reread this text \nas I ask that you do, that Heidegger, provisionally abandoning Parmenides, \nwhom he is reading, and turning to Sophocles\u2019 Antigone16 to look for the po-\netic sketch of what could be the Greek way of listening to the essence of man \n15.

Before the state, and thus before \nwhat we call the political, the polis is the Da, the l\u00e0 [there] in which and \nas which Da- sein is geschichtlich, advenes as history, as the historial origin \nof history. To this historial site belong not only sovereigns (Herrscher), the \nmen who hold power, the army, the navy, the council, the assemblies of the \npeople, but also gods, temples, priests, poets, thinkers.17 But what matters \nmost to us here, in the paths of these readings of Sophocles, is the moment \nwhen Heidegger translates the deinotaton of the deinon, the most terrible, \nmost violent, or most worrying in the worrying, spoken of in lines 332\u201375 \nof Antigone, which also say that there is nothing more deinon than man, as \ndas Unheimlichste des Unheimlichen,18 of which he will say that it resides in \ncon\ufb02 ict, in the antagonistic relation (im gegenwendigen Bezug) between jus-\ntice (dike\u00af) and tekhne\u00af. Heidegger himself asks, \u201cWhy do we translate deinon \nas un- heimlich?\u201d19 The principle of his reply is that the sentence (Spruch) that \nsays, \u201cDer Mensch ist das Unheimlichste [deinotaton, then]\u201d (\u201cMan is the most \nun heimlich\u201d) gives the authentic, proper, Greek de\ufb01 nition of man (gibt die \neigentliche griechische De\ufb01 nition des Menschen). Why? Why translate it this \nway? Not to add a meaning after the fact to the word deinon (which is often \ntranslated as \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cterrible\u201d), nor because we hear the Unheimliche \nas a sensory impression, as an affect or what makes an impression on our \nsensibility, but because there is in the Unheimliche something that expels us \nfrom the heimliche, from the peaceful quiet of the domestic, the heimisch, \nthe usual (Gewohnten), the current and the familiar (Gel\u00e4u\ufb01 gen). Man is the \nmost unheimlich, because he steps outside the familiar, the habitual frontiers \n(Grenzen) of habit, etc. When the chorus says of man that he is to deinotaton \nor das Unheimlichste, the point for Heidegger is not to say that man is this \nor that, and only then unheimlichste: the point is much more, much earlier \n[bien plut\u00f4t, bien plus t\u00f4t], more originarily, to say that the essence of man, \nwhat is proper to man (his fundamental feature, his Grundzug), is this being \nforeign to everything that one can identify as familiar, recognizable, etc. \nWhat is proper to man would be, basically, this way of not being secure at \nhome (heimisch), even with oneself as with one\u2019s proper essence.

That is, I am convinced, Lenz and his step, Lenz and his \n\u201cLong live the King!\u201d\n \n\u201c. . . but now and then he experienced a sense of uneasiness because he \nwas not able to walk on his head.\u201d\n \nWhoever walks on his head, ladies and gentlemen, whoever walks on \nhis head has heaven beneath him as an abyss [wer auf dem Kopf geht, der hat \nden Himmel als Abgrund unter sich].23\nThere here comes about, in Celan\u2019s path or poetic speech, but, as always \nwith decisive events, under the category or the reserve of the \u201cperhaps\u201d \n(vielleicht), in truth between two \u201cperhaps\u2019s\u201d and even three \u201cperhaps\u2019s\u201d and \neven four, \ufb01 ve, six, seven, eight \u201cperhaps\u2019s\u201d (in about twenty lines and two \nparagraphs), there here comes about, then, between two and three and four, \n\ufb01 ve, six, seven, eight \u201cperhaps\u2019s\u201d the event of an  unheard- of turning, the \nriskiness of which I would like to experience with you and, so to speak, re-\nconnoiter the corner turned. Celan has just referred to the obscurity proper \nto poetry as the place of an encounter to come from the horizon of the dis-\ntant and the foreign. Here is a \ufb01 rst perhaps: (Read and comment)\nLadies and gentlemen, nowadays it is fashionable to reproach poetry for its \n\u201cobscurity.\u201d [. . .] That is, I believe, if not the inherent obscurity of poetry, \nthe obscurity attributed to it for the sake of an encounter \u2014 from a great \ndistance or sense of strangeness perhaps of its own making [vielleicht selbst-\nentworfenen].\nAnd then, still under the reservation of a second perhaps, there is a strange \ndivision of the strange itself: perhaps there are two sorts of strange, right up \nclose to each other:\nBut there are perhaps two kinds of strangeness, in one and the same direc-\ntion \u2014 side by side. [Aber es gibt vielleicht, und in einer und derselben Rich-\ntung, zweierlei Fremde \u2014 dicht beieinander.]\nAnd now, to specify this duality at the very heart of the foreigner, here is a \nsort of revolution in the revolution. You remember that Lucile\u2019s \u201cLong live \nthe King!\u201d had been saluted as a counterstatement (Gegenwort) which was, \nperhaps (\u201cI believe,\u201d Celan says at that point), poetry, in which a homage \nwas rendered, far from the political code of reactionary countermanifesta-\ntion, to the (nonpolitical) majesty of the absurd that bore witness to the \npresent or the now of the human. Now another \u201cLong live the King,\u201d the \n\u201cLong live the King!\u201d of Lenz, i.e. B\u00fcchner, is supposed to go a step further \n23.
