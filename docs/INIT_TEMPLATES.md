## Assessment Agent Prompts

### Security Scan
```
Task(subagent_type="security-engineer", model="sonnet", prompt="""
Quick security scan of this codebase:
1. Check for hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. Look for .env files that shouldn't be committed
3. Check dependency vulnerabilities (read package-lock.json or equivalent)
4. Identify obvious auth/input validation gaps
Return: Score (1-10), critical issues list, recommendations
""")
```

### Test/Quality Assessment
```
Task(subagent_type="quality-engineer", model="sonnet", prompt="""
Quick quality assessment:
1. Do tests exist? What framework?
2. Estimate coverage from test file count vs source file count
3. Are there integration/E2E tests?
4. Check for obvious testing gaps
Return: Score (1-10), coverage estimate, gaps identified
""")
```

### Architecture Review
```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", model="sonnet", prompt="""
Quick architecture review:
1. Is there clear separation of concerns?
2. Are there obvious circular dependencies?
3. Is the project structure conventional for the stack?
4. Any code organization red flags?
Return: Score (1-10), structure assessment, recommendations
""")
```

### Documentation Check
```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", model="sonnet", prompt="""
Documentation completeness check:
1. Does README exist and have setup instructions?
2. Is there API documentation?
3. Are there inline comments where needed?
4. Is there a contributing guide?
Return: Score (1-10), gaps identified
""")
```

### Thorough Assessment (--thorough only)
```
Task(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="Deep architecture review: dependency graph, complexity hotspots, code duplication")
Task(subagent_type="security-engineer", prompt="Full security audit: auth flows, data handling, API security")
```

## CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Quick Start for AI Assistants
1. Read this file completely
2. Check `improvement_roadmap` memory for known issues
3. Run `/project:plan` before significant coding
4. Use Serena memories for context

## Stack
- **Language**: [Detected]
- **Framework**: [Detected]
- **Testing**: [Detected framework] - `[actual command]`
- **Linting**: [Detected] - `[actual command]`
- **Build**: `[actual command]`

## Health Status
**Last assessed**: [Date]
**Score**: [X]/100

### Known Issues (from init assessment)
- [P0 issues if any]
- [P1 issues summary]

See `improvement_roadmap` memory for full details.

## Development Phase
[From user input]

## Rules
ALWAYS:
- Run `[test command]` before committing
- Run `[lint command]` to check style
- [From constraints]

NEVER:
- [From constraints]
- [From security findings if relevant]

## Commands
- `/project:auto <task>` - Autonomous development
- `/project:explore <topic>` - Investigate codebase
