# Signal Log Directory

This directory captures signals for the self-improvement system.

## Signal Types

- internal-*.md: Test failures, lint errors, runtime errors
- external-*.md: Human corrections and clarifications
- process-*.md: Workflow violations, escalations, context loss

## Format

Each signal file should contain:
```yaml
timestamp: ISO8601
type: internal|external|process
subtype: specific-subtype
description: what happened
context: what was being done
resolution: how it was handled (if any)
```

## Lifecycle

1. Signals captured by hooks or manually
2. /project:diagnose processes signals
3. Diagnosed signals archived to signals/processed/
4. Undiagnosed signals remain for next review
